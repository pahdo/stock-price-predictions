1   Organization and Description of Business   

Propel
Media, Inc. ( Propel ), a Delaware corporation is a diversified online advertising company. Propel generates revenues
through the sale of advertising to advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and internationally to promote
their products and services. Propel is a holding company for Propel Media LLC ( Propel Media ), a California limited
liability company, and Kitara Media Corp. ( Kitara ), a Delaware corporation (Propel, Propel Media and Kitara, together,
the  Company ).  

Propel
delivers advertising via its real-time, bid-based, online advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform
allows advertisers to target audiences and deliver video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform
provide advertisers with an effective way to serve, manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing.
Propel offers both a self-serve platform and a managed services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online
audiences and acquire customers. Propel has more than 1,400 advertiser customers and serves millions of ads per day.  

Propel
primarily serves its advertising to users that it has acquired through a user-driven business model. These users have agreed to
see advertising in exchange for free content that we provide. In this model, Propel also serves advertising through partners who
also acquire users by providing a variety of applications free of charge in exchange for the ability to serve ads to their users.  

Propel
has also developed a publisher-driven business model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply
channels expand our ability to serve advertising. In this model, the advertising units are served to users through a traditional
website, and we serve advertising units to the user in coordination with the publisher, network or exchange.  

Propel
was formed on October 7, 2014. On January 28, 2015, Propel consummated the  reverse business combination  (the  Reverse
Merger  or the  Transactions ) as contemplated by (i) the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Merger
Agreement ), dated as of October 10, 2014, by and among Kitara, Propel, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kitara, and Kitara Merger Sub, Inc. ( Merger Sub ), which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel, and
(ii) the Unit Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ), dated as of October 10, 2014 and amended as of December
23, 2014, April 29, 2015 and January 26, 2016 by and among Kitara, Propel, Propel Media and the former members of Propel Media
( Transferors  or  Members ) (See Note 4   Reverse Business Combination and Recapitalization). Upon
the closing of the Transactions, Propel became the new public company and Kitara and Propel Media became wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Propel.  

On
January 28, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Reverse Merger, Propel, Kitara and Propel Media as  Borrowers 
and certain of their subsidiaries as  Guarantors  entered into a financing agreement ( Financing Agreement )
with certain financial institutions as  Lenders.   

The
Financing Agreement provided the Borrowers with (a) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $81,000,000 (the  Term
Loan ) and (b) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding
(the  Revolving Loan  and, together with the Term Loan, the  Loans ). The Loans will mature on January
28, 2019 ( Final Maturity Date ).  

Immediately
following the Reverse Merger, the Transferors owned 61.7% of the merged company and the former stockholders of Kitara owned 38.3%
of the merged company.

1   Organization and Description of Business, continued   

As
a result of the Reverse Merger, the Transferors acquired a majority of Propel s common stock and both Propel Media s
and Kitara s officers became the officers and directors of Propel, including the Company s prior Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. Robert Regular, who later left the Company on April 30, 2016. For accounting purposes, the Reverse Merger has been treated
as an acquisition of Kitara by Propel Media whereby Propel Media was deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The historical consolidated
financial statements prior to January 28, 2015 are those of Propel Media. In connection with the Reverse Merger, the equity accounts
of Propel Media have been restated on a recapitalization basis so that all equity accounts are now presented as if the member
interest exchanged for shares of Propel Media common stock had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.  

Recent
Developments     

Reduction
in Force and Management Restructuring    

On
April 26, 2016, Propel began notifying its employees about plans to reduce the Company s workforce by approximately 20% percent.
The notifications were completed on April 27, 2016. These actions were part of a strategic plan designed to improve operational
and cost efficiency. For the most part, the employee reductions were in the Company s publisher driven business. The Company
intends to de-emphasize that business unit and will transfer its responsibilities to the remaining employees of the Company.  

Effective
April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Regular, who until April 30, 2016 served as the Company s
Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the separation agreement, the Company will pay Mr. Regular (i) $536,986 in 12 monthly installments,
(ii) all valid expense reimbursements through April 30, 2016, and (iii) all accrued but unused vacation pay through April 30,
2016. In addition, an option to purchase 2,400,000 shares at $0.20 per share held by Mr. Regular will fully vest and be exercisable
until June 30, 2018 and an option to purchase 2,100,000 shares at $0.55 per share held by Mr. Regular will fully vest and be exercisable
until April 30, 2017. Non-cash charges for the acceleration of these stock-based compensation awards were approximately $489,000.
The employment agreement, as modified by the separation agreement, will restrict Mr. Regular from disclosing confidential information
concerning the business of the Company, will contain customary restrictive covenants relating to noncompetition and non-solicitation,
which continue to run until January 28, 2017, and Mr. Regular has agreed to release and waive all claims against the Company.
On June 30, 2016, Mr. Regular forgave a note payable due to him in exchange for a $5,000 cash payment and the rights to certain
website, domain name, and email member databases (See Note 7).  

On
April 26, 2016, the Company also entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to the employment agreement, dated as
of March 5, 2015, as amended, with David Shapiro, the Company s Chief Operating Officer. The Amendment increases Mr. Shapiro s
base salary from $320,000 to $350,000, effective as of May 1, 2016.  

S  ale
of Health Guru Operations    

On
April 27, 2016, the Company sold certain assets of its Health Guru business. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, the
Company received a cash payment of $54,000 at closing. The Company is eligible to receive contingent consideration consisting
of (i) upon each closing of a capital raise from an outside third party conducted by the purchaser for the Health Guru business,
up to $200,000 in the aggregate among all such closings, provided that only 5% of the net proceeds (after deducting commissions
and expenses) from any such raise shall be used to satisfy this payment obligation and (ii) quarterly payments over the 36 months
following the closing date equal to 50% of the quarterly profits generated in full, or in part, by the assets, provided that such
payments shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate. Through September 30, 2016, other than the gross cash proceeds from seller of
$54,000, the Company has received no other consideration from the sale of the Health Guru business.

Note
2   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash on hand was $1,263,000 and the Company had a working capital deficit of $5,383,000.
The Company recorded net losses of $142,000 and $679,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflected an income before income tax of $2,108,000 and an income tax
expense of $2,250,000. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected an income before income tax expense
of $1,208,000 and an income tax expense of $1,887,000. The 2016 income tax expense includes charges of approximately $1,437,000,
principally to adjust the Company s deferred income tax accounts for updated estimates for state apportionment factors.
The Company has historically met its liquidity requirements through operations.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the borrowing base under the Revolving Loan was approximately $3,244,000. After consideration of the outstanding
balance of $0 under the Revolving Loan, there remained $3,244,000 available to be borrowed at September 30, 2016 under the Revolving
Loan.  

Cash
flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $5,250,000 of principal repayments
on the Company s Term Loan and repayments of $1,762,000 of the Revolving Loan.  

The
Company s operating cash flows are dependent upon being able to cost effectively acquire and maintain a base of user audience
to whom the Company serves advertising from its customers. Due to certain broad-based industry changes, commencing in 2015,
the Company has been losing user audience from its third party application partners. As a counter measure to rebuild its user
audience, the Company has been developing an owned and operated audience of users. During the second and third quarters of 2016,
based upon continuously evolving systemic industry changes, including by companies who operate the marketplace s largest
web browsers, the Company found it more difficult and expensive to grow and retain user audience through its owned and operated
user audience. This made it difficult to increase revenues from owned and operated properties and correspondingly offset the revenue
declines from the third party application partners. The Company is developing alternative products and methodologies through which
it will acquire additional user audience.  

Pursuant
to the Financing Agreement, the Company is subject to a leverage ratio requirement as of the end of each calendar quarter. The
Company was in compliance with such leverage ratio requirement as of September 30, 2016. Based upon its current projections, the
Company may not be in compliance with its future leverage ratio requirements. The Company is in discussions with the Lenders to
obtain a waiver or other modification of its obligations under the Financing Agreement. There is no guarantee that the Lenders
will approve a waiver and/or a modification of the Financing Agreement that would be acceptable to both the Lenders and the Company.  

Subject
to the Company s favorable progress in its initiatives to cost effectively develop and maintain its user audience and subject
to a favorable resolution of its compliance obligations with the Lenders, management believes that the Company s cash balances
on hand and cash flows expected to be generated from operations and borrowings available under the Company s Revolving Loan
will be sufficient to fund the Company s net cash requirements through November 2017.

3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) regarding unaudited interim financial information. In the opinion
of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s condensed consolidated balance
sheets, statements of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year due to seasonal and other factors.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with US
GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements and footnotes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company s most significant
estimates relate to the accounts receivable allowance, the forfeiture of customer deposits, the valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, recognition of revenue, and the valuation of stock options.  

Cash    

The
Company s credit facility includes the Revolving Loan. The Company classifies a negative balance outstanding under the Revolving
Loan as cash, as these amounts are legally owed to the Company and are immediately available to be drawn upon by the Company.

Note
3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued   

Accounts
Receivable    

Accounts
receivable are stated at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts.  

The
Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the Company s
customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as customer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable
amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. The Company uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best
available facts and circumstances, to record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These
allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received.  

The
allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $217,000 and $290,000, respectively.  

Intangible
Assets    

The
Company s long-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
there may be an impairment. These assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and
assets not acquired in acquisitions were recorded at historical cost. However, if their estimated fair value is less than the
carrying amount, other intangible assets with indefinite life are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment
charge to our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Based upon the decline of performance of the Health Guru operations,
the Company recorded impairment charges of $0 and $129,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
representing the remaining book value of the video library.  

Capitalization
of Internally Developed Software    

The
Company capitalizes certain costs related to its software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC
350-40. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal
and external costs incurred during the application development stage, including upgrades and enhancements representing
modifications that will result in significant additional functionality, are capitalized. Software maintenance and training
costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the software s estimated useful life ranging from 12 months to 36 months. The Company
evaluates these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability
of these assets. Based upon the decline in performance of the Health Guru operations, the Company recorded impairment charges
of $0 and $54,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, to record the write off of the book
value of Health Guru s internally developed capitalized software.

Revenue
Recognition     

Propel
generates revenue from advertisers by serving their ads to a user audience consisting of the Company s private owned and
operated network, users of our application partners  properties and users from our publisher driven traffic. In all cases,
our revenue is generated when an advertisement is served by us or when a user action occurs based on the advertisement we served
(i.e., a view, a click, a conversion action, etc.).  There is a specific transaction that triggers a billable instance.  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue
Recognition  ( ASC 605 ). Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, no significant Company obligations remain, collection of the related receivable is
reasonably assured and the amounts are fixed and determinable. The gross advertising campaign revenue is recognized in the period
that the advertising impressions, clicks or actions occur, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
The Company s agreements do not require a guaranteed minimum number of impressions, clicks or actions. With respect to advertising
campaign activities, the Company acts as a principal in that it is the primary obligor to the advertiser customer. 

The
amounts on deposit from customers are recorded as an advertiser deposit liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets.  

Cost
of Revenues     

Publisher
expenses and other service costs represent the costs of acquiring advertising consumers for the Company s publisher network,
revenue-sharing costs to third party application developer partners, publisher costs of third-party networks and properties, transaction
costs, and commissions to sales representatives for advertising revenue. The majority of the publisher expense represents marketing
expenses to obtain new users for the Company s owned and operated properties. Acquisition costs of new users are incurred
on the date the user joins as a Company owned and operated user or when a prospective user views an impression of the Company s
advertising, and are accordingly charged to earnings on those respective dates. The advertising revenue associated with a user
is recognized as it occurs over the period in which such user is part of the Company s owned and operated network. The Company
allows an approved group of third party application developer companies to distribute the Company s advertising to its users
through a revenue-share arrangement. The Company charges to expense the collected revenue-sharing costs of advertising units to
users of third party application developer companies when the impression, click or action occurs.

Concentration
of Credit Risk and Significant Customers     

The
Company s concentration of credit risk includes its concentrations from key customers and vendors. The details of these
significant vendors are presented in the following table for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
There were no concentrations of revenue or accounts receivable from key customers and no vendor concentrations within accounts
payable during these periods;  

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash
is deposited with a limited number of financial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution may be in excess
of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limits. Accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held cash balances in excess of federally insured limits.  

The
Company extends credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. The Company generally

Effective
January 28, 2015, the Company completed its Reverse Merger, whereby Propel Media (a limited liability company) was deemed to be
the accounting acquirer of Kitara (a C corporation). The historical financial statements were those of Propel Media. From the
date of the Reverse Merger, the Company s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the
Reverse Merger, the Company s operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed
as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns.
Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the period
prior to January 28, 2015.

The
unaudited pro forma computation of income tax expense included in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, represents the tax effects that would have been reported had the Company been subject to U.S.
federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented. Pro forma income tax expense is based upon the statutory
income tax rates and adjustments to income for estimated permanent differences occurring during each period. Actual rates and
expenses could have differed had the Company actually been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes for all periods presented.
Therefore, the unaudited pro forma amounts are for informational purposes only and are intended to be indicative of the results
of operations had the Company been fully subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented.  

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s income tax provision included a charge of approximately
$1,437,000 to reduce deferred income tax assets, principally to reflect updated estimated state apportionment factors for future
state income taxes.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $31,386,000, for the change in income
tax status of Propel Media. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, except for each of the above noted one-time
adjustments, income tax related to ordinary income in such interim periods was computed at an estimated annual effective tax rate
of 37% and 40% for each of the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net
Income (Loss) per Share    

Earnings
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive,
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable
upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded potential common shares
resulting from the exercise of stock options (23,517,500 and 28,675,000 potential common shares, respectively) and of warrants
(6,363,636 potential common shares) as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

Subsequent
events     

The
Company has evaluated events that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2016 through the date these condensed consolidated financial
statements were issued. Management has concluded that there were no subsequent events that required disclosure in these condensed
consolidated financial statements.  

Reclassification    

Certain
amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on previously reported net income (loss).

Accounting Pronouncements      

In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments .
ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.
Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the
adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been
completed at the acquisition date. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016 and such adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update will require organizations that lease assets to
recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance
will also require additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions
of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update requires
that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense
or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income
tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate
the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update are effective for
annual and interim periods beginning or after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic
606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for
those areas. ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard

May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,
 Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ). The core principal of ASU 2016-12

on the eight specific cash flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the
settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests

The
Transactions and Merger Agreement, continued    

Pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, as amended on January 26, 2016, the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation is payable in cash and/or stock
not later than, June 30, 2019. The Company can pay the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation from the raising of capital via an equity
financing or from available working capital. The Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to complete equity financings
that would raise sufficient net proceeds to pay the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in cash to the Transferors on or before June
30, 2019 (the  Equity Financing Period ). In addition, the Company s board of directors, at least two times
per year during the Equity Financing Period, is obligated to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the amount, if any,
of the Company s working capital available to be used to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in
cash, taking into account such factors as it may deem relevant. If the Company s board of directors determines that there
is available working capital to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation, the Company must use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly obtain any required lender consent and, if such consent is obtained, must promptly pay to the Transferors
an amount in cash equal to such available working capital. Finally, Mr. Pobre, on behalf of the Transferors, is permitted to elect,
during the ten day period following each December 31st during the Equity Financing Period, commencing December 31, 2016, to receive
any unpaid amount of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in shares of the Company s common stock. For such issuance, each
share of the Company s common stock will be valued at the closing market price of the Company s common stock as reported
on NASDAQ or such other national securities exchange on which the Holdco Common Stock is listed (or if not so listed, the bid
price on the over-the-counter bulletin board) on the date prior to the date on which such shares are issued to the Transferors.  

The
Company recorded the obligations for the $10,000,000 Deferred Payment and the $6,000,000 Deferred Payment, (in the aggregate,
 Deferred Payments to Transferors ) to Transferors at fair value. Fair value was determined by recording the fixed
obligations at their net present value, discounted at an interest rate of 10% per annum. The discount rate used was based upon
the interest rate of the Term Loan. The Company is amortizing the discount utilizing the interest method over the periods for
which future amounts are due. On January 28, 2015, upon the consummation of the Exchange, the Company recorded the fair value
of the Deferred Payments to Transferors of $12,696,000, reflecting a discount of $3,304,000. As discussed above, on January 26,
2016, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the transferors agreed to defer receipt of the $10,000,000 until June 2019. This extension
of the timing to remit payment was evaluated for extinguishment accounting. The amendment was determined to be a modification
for accounting purposes, and as such, the unamortized discount of $9,582,000 will be amortized over the remaining term of the
obligation. As a result, subsequent to the amendment date, the effective interest rate on the obligation was reduced to 1.25%.  

For
the three month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded discount amortization of $148,000 and $337,000, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded discount amortization of $493,000 and $881,000
respectively. The unamortized discount was $1,584,000 as of September 30, 2016 and $2,077,000 as of December 31, 2015.

The
Financing Agreement provided for certain fees to be paid, including (i) a closing fee of $2,880,000 which was withheld from the
proceeds of the Term Loan and was accounted for as an original issue discount and is being amortized to interest expense using
the interest method over the term of the Term Loan and (ii) a ( Deferred Fee ) of $12,500,000 payable to the Lenders
and due upon the fourth anniversary of the inception of the Term Loan. The Company is accreting the Deferred Fee as a finance
charge over the term of the Term Loan. The Company recorded amortization of the closing fee as interest expense of $190,000 and
$206,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $577,000 and $556,000 for the nine months

condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

In
addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $916,000 in connection with the Loans which has been accounted for as debt
discount and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Term Loan. The Company recorded as interest
expense amortization of the debt issuance costs of $60,000 and $66,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $184,000 and $180,000, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The balances of the

The
Company has outsourced technology development services and other administrative services to a technology company in Eastern Europe
( Technology Vendor ). This technology company is owned by an individual who through October 6, 2014 owned more than
10% of the member interest in Propel Media and subsequent to which such ownership was transferred to certain trusts. The technology
development services and other administrative services provided to the Company by this related party during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled $838,000 and $660,000 respectively, and $2,353,000 and $1,935,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts were included in property and equipment and operating expenses,
as applicable, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Certain of the costs incurred for the technology development services described above were for the development of internal-use
software, which were capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life. In addition, the Company had amounts due to this
entity of $264,000 and $3,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are reported within accrued
expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

On
January 28, 2015, in connection with the Reverse Merger, the Company s Board of Directors appointed Howard Yeaton as the
Company s Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yeaton is the Managing Principal of Financial Consulting Strategies LLC ( FCS ).
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company has incurred a total of $47,000 and $97,000 respectively,
and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company has incurred a total of $149,000 and $435,000 respectively,

Litigation    

From

Other than as set forth below, at September 30, 2016, there were no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company was
a party or to which any of its property was subject that were expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse
effect on us.  

In
December 2013, an action entitled Intrepid Investments, LLC ( Intrepid ) v. Selling Source, LLC ( Selling Source ),
et al., Index No. 65429/2013 was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This is an action commenced
by Intrepid to collect on a Junior Secured Promissory Note signed by Selling Source in the original principal sum of $28,700,000
(the  Note ). The Company is not a signatory to the Note but Kitara Media did sign an August 31, 2010 Security Agreement
( Security Agreement ) pledging all of its accounts, cash and cash equivalents, chattel paper, contracts, deposit
accounts, documents, equipment, fixtures, general intangibles, all other goods, all shares of capital stock of any companies it
owned, all instruments including all promissory notes, all intellectual property, all insurance policies and all proceeds thereof,
all inventory, all other investment property, all letter of credit rights, all other tangible and intangible personal property
and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, as security for the Note. At the time Kitara Media signed the Security Agreement, it
was wholly-owned by Selling Source. On July 1, 2013, Kitara Media merged with one of Kitara s then wholly-owned subsidiaries,
with Kitara Media surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara. Accordingly, it is no longer wholly-owned
by Selling Source, although it is still an affiliate of Selling Source. In the action, Intrepid seeks to foreclose on the security
interest. Both Selling Source s and Kitara Media s obligations to Intrepid under the Note and Security Agreement were
subordinate to obligations Selling Source had to two groups of prior lenders ( Senior Lenders ). The right of Intrepid
to compel payments under the Note and/or foreclose the lien created by the Security Agreement was subject to an Intercreditor
Agreement by and between the Senior Lenders and Intrepid. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, Intrepid could not take
steps to compel Selling Source to make payment on the Note or foreclose the Security Agreement so long as the obligations to the
Senior Lenders remained outstanding. In addition, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Lenders had the right
to have the lien released on any of the collateral pledged as security under the Security Agreement. In the New York action, Intrepid
has challenged the Senior Lenders  authority to release the lien and also challenged the enforceability of the Intercreditor
Agreement generally.  The Court has not yet ruled on the merits of that challenge.  In addition, Selling Source s
obligations to the Senior Lenders remains outstanding.

The
second matter is Intrepid Investments, LLC v. Selling Source, LLC et al., Index No. 654309/2013, which was filed in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This matter was originally limited to claims asserted by Intrepid against
Selling Source regarding an earn-out calculation entered into between it and Selling Source, and confirmed by an arbitrator. In
August, 2014, Intrepid amended its complaint to include various breach of contractor claims against a variety of those defendants,
including Kitara. The new defendants, including Kitara, answered the amended complaint on November 7, 2014, denying liability
for all claims. On February 19, 2015, the Court entered an order granting Selling Source s motion to affirm the arbitration
results. On March 3, 2015, Selling Source filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of eleven of Intrepid s
remaining claims, and, in September 2015, the New York Supreme Court granted this motion for summary judgment. The claims asserted
against Kitara were not among those addressed in Selling Source s motion.  

Based
on these facts, Propel believes Intrepid s claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. In any event,
Selling Source has acknowledged an obligation to indemnify and defend Kitara Media from any liability to Intrepid arising out
of the Note and Security Agreement. The parties have exchanged pleadings and Selling Source has provided documents and written
interrogating responses to Intrepid.

Company maintains a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Plan ). Participating
employees may defer a percentage of their eligible pre-tax earnings up to the Internal Revenue Service s annual contribution
limit. All full-time employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Plan.  

The
Plan does not permit investment of participant contributions in the Company s common stock. The Company s matching
contributions to the Plan are discretionary. The Company recorded contribution expense of $41,000 and $40,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $178,000 and $152,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

2014
Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan   

On
October 9, 2014, Propel and its sole stockholder approved the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ), pursuant
to which a total of nine percent of the fully-diluted shares of the Company s common stock outstanding as of the closing
of the Transactions (or 26,172,326 shares) became available for awards under the plan upon such closing. Kitara s stockholders
approved the plan as of January 26, 2015.  

2012
and 2013 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plans   

On
May 14, 2012 and December 3, 2013, Kitara adopted the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan ( 2012 Plan ) and the 2013
Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan ( 2013 Plan ). The 2012 Plan and 2013 Plan provide for the grant of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to, among others, the officers, directors, employees
and consultants of the Company.  

Effective
January 28, 2015, Propel assumed the 2012 Plan and 2013 Plan, and all outstanding stock options thereunder. Propel amended the
plans so that no further awards may be issued under such plans after the closing of the Reverse Merger.

The
following table is a summary of stock option award:  

The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the weighted average exercise price of the underlying outstanding
stock options and the fair value of the Company s common stock, based upon the closing price of the Company s common
stock as reported on the OTCBB on September 30, 2016. The Black-Scholes method option pricing model was used to estimate the fair
value of the option awards using the following range of assumptions.  The simplified method was used to determine the
expected life of grants to employees, as these granted options were determined to be  plain-vanilla  options. The
full term was used for the expected life for options granted to consultants.

September 30, 2016, the unamortized value of options was $2,207,000. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized portion will be
expensed through November 2019 and the weighted average remaining amortization period was 2.4 years.  

Note
11   Executive Bonus Plan   

The
Company previously sponsored the Propel Media Incentive Profit Sharing Plan (the  Profit Sharing Plan ). Effective
January 1, 2016, the Profit Sharing Plan was replaced with the Propel Media Executive Bonus Plan (the  Executive Bonus Plan )
for certain employees of the Company. The Executive Bonus Plan provides for bonuses based on the performance of the Company. Bonus
expense for earned bonuses under the Executive Bonus Plan amounted to $237,000 and $390,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $600,000 and $1,054,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The bonuses are included in salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses within the Company s condensed consolidated
statements of operations. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the accrued executive bonuses were $234,000 and $416,000
respectively, and the amounts were included in accrued expenses within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Overview  

General 

Propel is a holding company for Propel Media and Kitara. 

Propel is a diversified online advertising company.
Propel generates revenues through the sale of advertising to advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and internationally
to promote their products and services. 

Propel delivers advertising, including via its real-time,
bid-based, online advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform allows advertisers to target audiences
and deliver video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform provide advertisers with an effective
way to serve, manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing. Propel offers both a self-serve platform
and a managed services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online audiences and acquire customers. Propel has
approximately 1,400 advertiser customers and serves millions of ads per day. 

Propel primarily serves its advertising to users that
it has acquired through a user-driven business model. These users have agreed to see advertising in exchange for free content
that Propel provides (we sometimes refer to this content as our  owned and operated properties ). In this model, Propel
also serves advertising through partners who also acquire users by providing a variety of applications free of charge in exchange
for the ability to serve ads to their users (we sometimes refer to these partners as our  third party application partners ). 

Propel has also developed a publisher-driven
business model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply channels expand our ability to serve advertising.
In this model, the advertising units are served to users through traditional websites, and Propel serves the advertising in coordination
with the publisher, network or exchange. 

Propel s principal executive office is
located at 2010 Main Street, Suite 900, Irvine, CA 92614. Its telephone number at that location is (949) 251-0640. 

Reverse Merger with Kitara  

On January 28, 2015, Propel consummated the transactions
(the  Transactions ) contemplated by (i) the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of October 10, 2014, by
and among Kitara, Propel, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara, and Kitara Merger Sub, Inc., which was previously
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel, and (ii) the Unit Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ), dated as of October
10, 2014 and amended as of December 23, 2014, April 29, 2015 and January 26, 2016 by and among Kitara, Propel, Propel Media and
the former members of Propel Media (the  Transferors ). Prior to the closing of the Transactions, Kitara was a public
operating company and Propel Media was a private operating company owned by the Transferors. Upon the closing of the Transactions,
Propel became the new public company and Kitara and Propel Media became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Propel. For accounting purposes,
the Transactions have been treated as an acquisition of Kitara by Propel Media. The historical consolidated financial statements
prior to January 28, 2015 are those of Propel Media. 

The results of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 fully include the operations of Kitara for these same periods. The results of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 include the results of operations for Kitara only since January 28, 2015. 

Operational Restructuring  

In April 2016, the Company commenced a
strategic plan designed to improve operational and cost efficiency through reducing its workforce by approximately 20%. The majority
of its employee reductions were in the Company s publisher-driven business. The Company believes that it can manage this
business unit with fewer people by integrating it with other functions of the business. In connection with this reduction, the
Company entered into a separation agreement with Robert Regular, its then Chief Executive Officer, on April 30, 2016. Marv Tseu
assumed Mr. Regular s role as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and ceased being its President. In addition, David
Shapiro became the Company s Chief Operating Officer and Secretary and ceased being its Chief Corporate Development Officer
and General Counsel. In connection with this workforce reduction and the separation agreement with Mr. Regular, the Company reported
a charge during the three months ending June 30, 2016 of approximately $1,309,000, consisting of cash severance payments of approximately
$820,000 and non-cash charges for the acceleration of stock-based compensation awards of approximately $489,000. The Company expects
cost savings form these actions to exceed the costs incurred. 

On April 27, 2016, the Company sold substantially
all of the assets of its Health Guru business, for a cash of $54,000 and the rights to receive certain future contingent consideration. 

On June 30, 2016, Mr. Regular, the Company s
former Chief Executive Officer and former director until April 30, 2016, forgave a promissory note with a face amount of $200,000
originally due to him on January 1, 2023, in exchange for a $5,000 cash payment in July 2016 and the rights to one of the Company s
websites and a related member database. 

Results of Operations  

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

Propel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations 

 (unaudited) 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue  

Consolidated revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased by $5,419,000, or 28%, to $13,687,000 as compared to $19,106,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was principally due to the decrease of revenue attributable to users from our third party application
partners throughout 2015 and continuing into 2016 due to policy changes instituted by those who operate the marketplace s
largest web browsers, which limited the ability of our third party application partners to distribute their products. Revenue attributable
to users from our third party application partners decreased more than the overall decrease for the period but such decrease was
partially offset by increased revenue from users from our owned and operated properties. Significant emphasis is being placed on
media buying to grow our higher lifetime value users from our owned and operated audience on a more cost efficient basis, thus
lessening our dependency on lower lifetime value users from our third party application partners (who respond at a lower level
to offers presented by our advertisers). During the second and third quarters of 2016, based upon continuously evolving systemic
industry changes, including by companies who operate the marketplace s largest web browsers, it has become more difficult to grow and retain user audience through our owned and operated user audience. This is making it difficult for us
to increase our revenues from users from our owned and operated properties and correspondingly offset the revenue declines from
the users from our third party application partners. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $1,941,000 or 16% to $9,861,000 as compared to $11,802,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Gross profit percentage improved to 72% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 62% during the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Our user audience has shifted substantially to that of our owned and operated properties and away from that
of our third party application partners. As such, our costs of revenues and gross profit are increasingly sensitive to our media
buy spending (to draw user audience to our owned and operated properties), rather than the costs of the commissions paid to the
third party application partners based directly on ads served by us to the users from our third party application partners. Our
revenue per user improved as compared to the same period in 2015, principally on account of improvements in the profile of the
user audience brought about through enhanced content offers. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our media buy acquisition
costs were lower on account of the above noted systemic industry changes and the migration of certain of our typical users to other
platforms, such as mobile. 

Operating income  

Operating income for the three months ended September
30, 2016 increased by $149,000 or 3% to $5,203,000 as compared to $5,054,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating
income as a percentage of revenue increased to 38% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 26% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income was principally due to lower employee costs and administrative expenses,
as a result of the headcount reduction, the sale of HealthGuru, and the closing of the New York office in April 2016, offset by
lower revenues and gross profit. 

Cost of revenues  

Cost of revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $3,478,000, or 48%, to $3,826,000 as compared to $7,304,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable principally to our reduction in media buy spending,
as discussed above. 

Salaries, commissions, benefits and related
expenses  

Salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,358,000, or 35% to $2,581,000 as compared to $3,939,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to our reduction
of 22 employees and consultants in connection with our April 2016 operational restructuring, resulting in lower salaries and incentive
compensation of $857,000 and a reduction of $169,000 in stock compensation. 

Technology, development and maintenance expenses  

Technology, development and maintenance expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $52,000 or 6%, to $883,000 as compared to $935,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally due to reduced software and hosting expenses in connection with the consolidation
of our technology operations, offset by increases in technology resources engaged during the three months ended September 30, 2015
to support our revenue, media buying and new revenue diversification initiatives. 

Other costs and operating expenses  

Other costs and operating expenses (marketing
and promotional, general and administrative, and professional services) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
by $707,000 or 51%, to $669,000 as compared to $1,376,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally
due to a $446,000 decrease in bad debt expense on account of certain account recoveries, a $109,000 decrease in rent attributable
to the closing of the New Jersey and New York office locations, and reductions in other operating costs attributable to the April
2016 operational restructuring. 

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $27,000, or 5%, to $525,000 as compared to $498,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase was principally a result of capitalized software for a large project being placed in service in
September 2015 and such software being amortized through August 31, 2016, resulting in an increase in amortization during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense  

Interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased by $550,000 or 15% to $3,095,000 as compared to $3,645,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the $7,000,000 principal reduction on the term loan and lower average
balance outstanding on the revolver. 

Net loss  

Net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $142,000, as compared to net income of $437,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, showing a decrease
of $579,000. Income before income tax was $2,108,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a income before
income tax of $1,409,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the income before income tax of $699,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was principally attributed to the decrease in interest expense of $550,000. The
decrease in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in income tax expense, which
included a charge of $1,437,000, principally to reflect adjustments to the deferred asset accounts for updated estimated state
apportionment factors for future state income taxes. 

Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure)  

In addition to the results presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA,
which is based upon the adjusted EBITDA which we report to our lenders, and is a key measurement monitored by management, and is
determined by taking net (loss) income and adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, stock based
compensation, bank fees, losses from extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring items, noncash items, merger and other onetime expenses
and severance. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP results, provides
useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results. The non-GAAP measure presented herein
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Please refer to page 27 for a reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITDA to net income. 

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September
30, 2016 increased by $64,000, or 1%, to $6,135,000 as compared to $6,071,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase is principally on account of reductions in recurring operating costs. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue  

Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased by $15,463,000, or 26%, to $44,589,000 as compared to $60,052,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was principally due to the decrease of revenue attributable to users from our third party application
partners due to policy changes instituted by those who operate the marketplace s largest web browsers, which limited the
ability of our third party application partners to distribute their products. Revenue attributable to users from our third party
application partners decreased more than the overall decrease for the period but such decrease was partially offset by increased
revenue from the Company s owned and operated properties. We have placed a significant emphasis on media buying to grow our
higher lifetime value users from our owned and operated user audience on a more cost efficient basis, thus lessening our dependency
on lower lifetime value consumers from users from our third party application partners who respond at a lower level to offers presented
by our advertisers. During principally the first half of 2016, based upon continuously evolving systemic industry changes, including
by companies who operate the marketplace s largest web browsers, we have experienced shorter lives of our users, making it
more difficult and expensive to grow and retain user audience through our owned and operated user audience. This is making it difficult
for us to increase our revenues from users from our owned and operated properties and correspondingly offset the revenue declines
from users from our third party application partners. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $4,403,000 or 14% to $28,159,000 as compared to $32,562,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Gross profit percentage improved to 63% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 54% during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Our user audience has shifted substantially to that of our more profitable owned and operated properties and away from
that of our third partly application partners. As such, our costs of revenues and gross profit are increasingly sensitive to our
media buy spending (to draw user audience to our owned and operated properties), rather than the costs of the commissions paid
to the third party application partners based directly on ads served by us to the users from the third party application partners.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue per user improved as compared to the same period in 2015, principally
on account of improvements in the profile of the user audience brought about through enhanced content offers. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, media buy acquisition costs were lower on account of the above noted systemic industry changes and the
migration of certain of our typical users to other platforms, such as mobile. Our media buying for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was less, but more precisely targeted to our specific user audiences. 

Operating income  

Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
by $2,653,000 or 20% to $10,368,000 as compared to $13,021,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating income as
a percentage of revenue increased to 23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 22% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in operating income was principally due to a decrease of gross profit of $4,403,000, partially offset by
a decrease in operating expenses, principally personnel and office expenses, related to our April 2016 operational restructuring. 

Cost of revenue  

Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $11,060,000, or 40% to $16,430,000 as compared to $27,490,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable principally to the shift in spending toward our owned
and operated properties for user audience acquisition. The decline in costs of sales is principally on account of the reduction
in commissions paid to our third party application partners of $6,431,000 and reductions in costs incurred for publishers of $2,684,000. 

Salaries, commissions, benefits and related
expenses  

Salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $657,000, or 6% to $10,501,000 as compared to $11,158,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to approximately $1,536,000
in lower salary and related benefit costs in connection with the April 2016 reduction in headcount, offset by higher severance
costs of $419,000 and additional stock-based compensation of $460,000 principally due to accelerated vesting of option awards. 

Technology, development and maintenance expenses  

Technology, development and maintenance expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $231,000 or 8%, to $3,086,000 as compared to $2,855,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally due to additional technology resources to support our revenue and
media buying initiatives. 

Other costs and operating expenses  

Other costs and operating expenses (marketing
and promotional, general and administrative, and professional services) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
by $1,909,000 or 45%, to $2,298,000 as compared to $4,207,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was principally
due to lower legal, accounting and tax service fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The higher professional fees
incurred during 2015 were principally in conjunction with the Transactions and the initial public company obligations. 

Depreciation and amortization  

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $402,000, or 30%, to $1,723,000 as compared to $1,321,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was principally a result of capitalized software for a large project being placed in service
and amortized in connection with the Company s ongoing technology development. 

Impairment of software and intangible assets  

Impairment charges for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $183,000 compared to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The impairment was a result of writing
off the carrying amounts of Health Guru s software and video library due to declines in the performance of the related business.
Management concluded that this impairment charge was necessary in connection with its preparation of the financial statements for
the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016. 

Other income (expense)  

Interest expense, net decreased by $705,000 to
$9,284,000 for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9,989,000 for the nine month ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease was principally due to the decrease in the balance of the Term Loan. The decrease in interest expense also reflects the
benefit of a one-time favorable interest reduction of $190,000 from the Lenders related to the revolver. 

On June 30, 2016, our former Chief Executive
Officer forgave a promissory note due from the Company to him on January 1, 2023. As a result, we recognized a gain of $106,000
from extinguishment of debt. 

Net loss  

Net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $679,000, as compared to net income of $34,085,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Income before income
tax benefit was $1,208,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to income before income tax benefit of $3,032,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the income before income tax expense of $1,824,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was principally on account of a decline in operating income of $2,653,000 offset by a decrease
in interest expense of $705,000. The 2016 income tax expenses includes charges of $1,437,000, principally to reflect adjustments
to the deferred asset accounts for updated estimated state apportionment factors for future state income taxes. The decrease in
net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the one-time income tax benefit of $31,386,000
to recognize deferred tax assets for the step up in basis for income tax purposes in connection with the change in income tax status
of Propel Media. 

Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure)  

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $2,203,000, or 13%, to $14,955,000 as compared to $17,158,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Overall the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was principally due to the decrease in revenue and related gross profit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
cash on hand was $1,263,000 and the Company had a working capital deficit of $5,383,000. The Company recorded net loss of $142,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a net loss of $679,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflected an income before income tax of $2,108,000 and a tax expense of $2,250,000.
The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflected an income before income tax expense of $1,208,000 and an income
tax expense of $1,887,000. 

Historically and through November 2016 we have
relied on cash flows provided by operations to fund operations and operating obligations. 

Our operating cash flows are dependent upon being
able to cost effectively acquire and maintain a base of user audience to whom the Company serves advertising from its customers.
During principally the first half of 2016, based upon continuously evolving systemic industry changes, including by companies who
operate the marketplace s largest web browsers, we found it more difficult to grow and retain user audience
through our owned and operated network. This made it difficult for us to increase our revenues from owned and operated properties
and correspondingly offset the revenue declines from the third party application partners. In order to offset these factors, the
Company is working to develop projects that it believes will help to grow its user audience and to diversify its sources of revenue. 

We are party to a financing agreement ( Financing
Agreement ) with Kitara and Propel Media, as borrowers, certain of their subsidiaries, as guarantors, and certain financial
institutions, as lenders (the  Lenders ). The Financing Agreement provides us with (a) a term loan in the aggregate
principal amount of $81,000,000 (the  Term Loan ) and (b) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding (the  Revolving Loan ). 

As of September 30, 2016, our indebtedness includes
$69,281,000 for our Term Loan (bearing interest at approximately 10% per annum) and a balance of $0 for our Revolving Loan (bearing
interest at 7.0% per annum for loans based upon Libor and 9.5% per annum for reference rate loans). In addition, we have $10,000,000
(which can be satisfied with cash or stock as per the terms of the Exchange Agreement) and $6,000,000 (which can be satisfied only
with cash as per the terms of the Exchange Agreement) of deferred payment obligations to the Transferors, and a $12,500,000 obligation
due to the Lenders pursuant to the Financing Agreement. We are obligated under our Financing Agreement to fund a principal reduction
of $1,750,000 at the end of each calendar quarter. Our Term Loan matures in January 2019. Amounts due to the Transferors are due
in 2019, as well as the $12,500,000 payment due to the Lenders pursuant to the Financing Agreement. 

As of September 30, 2016, the borrowing base
under the Revolving Loan was approximately $3,244,000. After consideration of the outstanding balance of $0 under the Revolving
Loan, there remained $3,244,000 available to be borrowed at September 30, 2016 under the Revolving Loan. 

The Financing Agreement contains a financial
covenant that requires us to maintain a specified total net leverage ratio as of each calendar quarter end. The total net leverage
ratio as of any such date is defined as the ratio of certain debt on such date to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Financing
Agreement) for the trailing 12-month period. Under this covenant, we were required to maintain a total leverage ratio of no more
than 3.25:1.00 as of September 30, 2016. Our total leverage ratio as of such date was 3.18:1.00. The balance of our Term Loan
decreases at the end of each calendar quarter as we remit a principal reduction of $1,750,000 each quarter. The total leverage
ratio that we must maintain decreases in each of the next six quarters, from 2.98:1.00 as of December 31, 2016 to 2.30:1.00 for
March 31, 2018 and each quarter thereafter. The Financing Agreement contains other covenants, as well, including, but not limited
to, covenants that (i) limit the amount we may invest in capital improvements; (ii) limit the amount we may incur in additional
debt; and (iii) require the delivery of certain periodic financial statements and an operating budget. 

Based
upon our current projections, we may not be in compliance with our future leverage ratio requirements. 

We are currently in compliance with all covenants under
the Financing Agreement and other loan documents.  However, as discussed above, our business, financial condition and operating
results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown.  Any one or more of such factors could,
directly or indirectly, cause us to fail to be in compliance with one or more of the covenants under the Financing Agreement and
other loan documents as of December 31, 2016 or in any subsequent quarter in the future.  We are currently in discussions
with the Lenders regarding the financial covenants under the Financing Agreement in order to attempt to ensure our future compliance
with such covenants.  However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating any changes to such covenants. 
Readers are cautioned to review the risks set forth in the periodic reports we file with the SEC for information relating to the
risks surrounding our continued compliance with such covenants 

Subject to the impact of the factors as discussed
above, management believes that the Company s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations
and borrowings available under our Revolving Loan will be sufficient to fund the Company s net cash requirements through
November 2017. 

Net cash provided by operating activities   

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$7,495,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6,861,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $634,000. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the reduction of $2,094,000 in
accounts receivable offset by a decrease of $1,572,000 in the change in accounts payable. 

Net cash used in investing activities   

Net cash used in investing activities was $849,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $963,000 provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is principally attributable to
the purchases of property and equipment, primarily for internally developed software and computer equipment. The net cash provided
by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is mainly composed of the cash acquired in connection with
the reverse merger with Kitara Media Corp offset by purchases of property and equipment 

Net cash used in financing activities   

Net cash used in financing activities was $7,012,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $9,114,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows used in financing activities consisted of a $5,250,000 principal reduction of
the Term Loan and net repayments of $1,762,000 under the Revolving Loan. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Critical Account Policies and Estimates   

See accounting policies in Note 3 of the condensed
consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our
principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

We are involved in various claims, legal actions
and regulatory proceedings arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Other than the matter described in Note
8 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q,
which description is incorporated herein by reference, in the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

The following description of risk factors
includes material changes to, and is in addition to, the certain risk factors associated with the Company s business previously
disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 30, 2016.
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together
with all of the other information included in this Form 10-Q, and the risks set forth in the Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015,before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or
results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part
of your investment . 

Our substantial debt could adversely affect our liquidity and
results of operations.    

As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately
$69,281,000 of total indebtedness (comprised of $69,281,000 for our Term Loan and $0 for our revolving loan). We may not be able
to generate sufficient profits and cash to service such debt as cash payments become due or to meet the various ratio requirements
of our indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks for us could intensify. 

Our substantial debt could have important consequences.
In particular, it could: 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;   

limit, along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds   

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate   

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and   

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.   

In addition, if we are unable to make payments
as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Credit Agreement and the other agreement governing our indebtedness,
there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit
Agreement or such other agreements, including pursuant to the cross-default provisions of such agreements, the lenders could terminate
their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore, our lenders under
the Credit Agreement could foreclose on their security interests in our assets, including the equity interests in our material
subsidiaries. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness
and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that
are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend the Financing Agreement or obtain needed waivers on
satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. 

Our debt agreements contain restrictive
and financial covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities
and failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our business.   

The Financing Agreement contains restrictive
covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:  

incur or guarantee additional debt or incur or suffer to exist additional liens;   

merge with another entity or dispose of our assets;   

change the nature of our business;   

make capital expenditures in excess of certain limits;   

make certain payments and distributions; and   

make certain investments.   

In addition, the Financing Agreement
contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a certain total leverage ratio (as defined in the Financing Agreement).
Under this covenant, we were required to maintain a total leverage ratio of no more than 3.25: 1.00 as of September 30, 2016. Our
total leverage ratio as of such date was 3.18:1.00. The total leverage ratio that we must maintain decreases in each of the next
six quarters, from 2.98:1.00 as of December 31, 2016 to 2.30:1.00 for March 31, 2018 and each quarter thereafter. Based upon our
current projections, we may not be in compliance with our future leverage ratio requirements. If we were to default on this financial
covenant, such default, if not waived by our lender, could severely limit our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital
that we might need to maintain and grow our business, could restrict our opportunities to participate in mergers and acquisitions,
and potentially constrain our ability to cost effectively execute on our business plan. Furthermore, we are dependent upon our
lenders for our revolving borrowing arrangement, which we rely upon as a source of borrowing for our operations. If we do not maintain
compliance with this financial covenant, we may lose our ability to draw upon the revolver arrangement and the lender may accelerate
our obligation to repay the amounts due. Should the funding under the Financing Agreement become unavailable to us, we may not
be able to find alternative sources of financing, and we may not be able to pay our liabilities and expenses when due, which could
result in the suspension of some or all of our current operations. It could also adversely affect the willingness of our vendors
and employees to continue to work with us. On the other hand, if we materially reduce our expenditures in order to comply
with this financial covenant in the short term, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected, which ultimately could lead to breach of this financial covenant in later periods. 

Our ability to comply with these provisions may
be affected by events beyond our control. Complying with these covenants also may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or
waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Furthermore, if an event of default occurs, our lenders could foreclose on
their security interests in our assets, including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries.
