CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This report and documents incorporated by reference into this report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry, our beliefs and assumptions. Words such as  believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   will,   goal,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that any of our plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Such forward-looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry, primarily providers of long-term care; credit and collection risks associated with this industry; having several significant clients who each individually contributed at least 3% with one as high as 9% of our total consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ; our claims experience related to workers  compensation and general liability insurance; the effects of changes in, or interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry, our workforce and services provided, including state and local regulations pertaining to the taxability of our services and other labor related matters such as minimum wage increases; continued realization of tax benefits arising from our corporate reorganization and self-funded insurance program transition; risks associated with the reorganization of our corporate structure; and the risk factors and other information described in Part I, Item I. of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   under  Government Regulation of Clients,   Competition  and  Service Agreements and Collections,  and under Item IA.  Risk Factors.  
    
  These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients and/or clients in bankruptcy or clients with which we are in litigation to collect payment, have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant additional bad debts in the near future. Additionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and labor-related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients. 
    
  In addition, we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients, provide new services to existing clients, achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and the successful execution of our projected growth strategies.

Note 1  Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Nature of Operations 
    
  Healthcare Services Group, Inc. (the  Company ) provides management, administrative and operating expertise and services to the housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility maintenance and dietary service departments of the health care industry, including nursing homes, retirement complexes, rehabilitation centers and hospitals located throughout the United States. Although we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs, our clients  reimbursements are subject to government regulation. Therefore, they are directly affected by any legislation relating to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs. 
    
  We provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients. In such agreements, we are responsible for the day-to-day management of  employees located at our clients  facilities. We also provide services on the basis of management-only agreements for a limited number of clients.  Our agreements with clients typically provide for renewable   one year   service terms, cancelable by either party upon   30   to   90   days notice after the initial   60   to   120   day period.  
    
  We are organized into   two   reportable segments: housekeeping, laundry, linen and other services ( Housekeeping ), and dietary department services ( Dietary ). 
    
  Housekeeping consists of the managing of clients  housekeeping departments, which are principally responsible for the cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing of patient rooms and common areas of a client s facility, as well as the laundering and processing of the personal clothing belonging to the facility s patients. Also within the scope of this segment s service is the responsibility for laundering and processing of bed linens, uniforms and other assorted linen items utilized by a client facility. 
    
  Dietary consists of managing clients  dietary department which is principally responsible for food purchasing, meal preparation and providing dietitian consulting professional services, which includes the development of a menu that meets patients  dietary needs. 
    
  Unaudited Interim Financial Data 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows. However, in our opinion, all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements. The balance sheet shown in this report as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from, and does not include, all of the disclosures contained in the financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. 
    
  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.  
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Healthcare Services Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. financial institutions or in custodial accounts with U.S. financial institutions. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase that are readily convertible into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk.

Table of Contents  

Inventories and Supplies 
    
  Inventories and supplies include housekeeping, linen and laundry supplies, as well as food provisions and supplies. Inventories and supplies are stated at cost to approximate a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Linen supplies are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of   24   months. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenues from our service agreements with clients are recognized as services are performed. 
    
  As a distributor of laundry equipment, we occasionally sell laundry installations to certain clients. The sales in most cases represent the construction and installation of a turn-key operation and have payment terms ranging from   24   to   60   months. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , laundry installation sales were not material. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period. We accrue for probable tax obligations as required by facts and circumstances in various regulatory environments. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. When appropriate, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts for which realization is more likely than not. 
    
  Uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns are reflected within our financial statements based on a recognition and measurement process.  
    
  Earnings per Common Share 
    
  Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common shares, such as those issuable upon exercise of stock options. 
    
  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards and programs for employees and directors. We estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, while share-based awards are valued based on the market-price on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, after accounting for forfeitures, is recognized as an expense in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income ratably over the requisite service periods.  
    
  Use of Estimates in Financial Statements 
    
  In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are used in determining, but are not limited to, our allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued insurance claims, asset valuations, deferred taxes and reviews for potential impairment. The estimates are based upon various factors including current and historical trends, as well as other pertinent industry and regulatory authority information. We regularly evaluate this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for our estimates and to adjust for known changes. 
    
  Self-Funded Captive Insurance Programs 
    
  In 2015, the Company transitioned its workers compensation and certain employee health   welfare insurance programs to HCSG Insurance Corp. ( HCSG Insurance ), its wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary which previously provided only general liability coverage to the Company.  HCSG Insurance was formed to provide the Company with greater efficiency in managing its property   casualty and health   welfare programs.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
    
  Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, deferred compensation funding and accounts and notes receivable. Our marketable securities are fixed income investments which are highly liquid and can be readily purchased or sold through established markets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in   one   large financial institution located in the United States. 
    
  Our clients are concentrated in the health care industry and are  primarily providers of long-term care. Many of our clients  revenues are highly reliant on Medicare, Medicaid and third party payors  reimbursement funding rates. Legislation can significantly alter  overall government reimbursement for nursing home services and such changes, as well as other trends in the long-term care industry, have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients, resulting in their inability to make payments to us in accordance with agreed upon payment terms. These factors could result in the recognition of significant additional bad debts in the future. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The update replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses with a methodology that instead reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , and a subsequent amendment to the standard in March 2016 with ASU 2016-08. The original standard provides guidance on recognizing revenue, including a five step model to determine when revenue recognition is appropriate. The standard requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendment to the standard clarifies implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. Adoption of the new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on their balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by most leases, while continuing to recognize expenses on their income statements over the lease term.  It will also require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures. 
            In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . The amendment in this ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The guidance becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management elected to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2016, with retrospective application to prior period balances presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income by Component 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains and losses from our available for sale marketable securities.  
  The following table provides a summary of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    All amounts are net of tax. 
               (2)   
    Realized gains and losses are recorded pre-tax under  Other income - Investment and interest  on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Note 3 Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets, and is computed using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated asset life or term of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. 
    
  The following table sets forth the amounts of property and equipment by each class of depreciable assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Depreciation expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,114,000   and   $1,036,000  , respectively.   Depreciation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    and   2015   was   $3,541,000   and   $3,247,000  , respectively. 

Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. 
    
  Goodwill by reportable operating segment, as described in Note 10 herein, was approximately   $42,377,000   and   $2,061,000   for Housekeeping and Dietary, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Intangible Assets 
    
  Our intangible assets represent customer relationships and non-compete agreements related to business combinations. The cost of intangible assets is based on fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The customer relationships have a weighted-average amortization period of   nine   years.  
    
  The following table sets forth the amounts of our identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization: 

The following table sets forth the estimated amortization expense for intangibles subject to amortization for the remainder of   2016  , the following five fiscal years and thereafter: 

Amortization expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $607,000   and   $811,000  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2,092,000   and   $2,431,000  , respectively.

Note 5 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following tables provide details of our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the basis for those measurements: 

(1)   
    The fair value of the money market fund is based on the net asset value ( NAV ) of the shares held by the plan at the end of the period. The money market fund includes short-term United States dollar denominated money market instruments and the NAV is determined by the custodian of the fund. The money market fund can be redeemed at its NAV at the measurement date as there are no significant restrictions on the ability to sell this investment. 
       
  The Company s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax), until realized. The fair value of these municipal bonds is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as these securities are measured using third party pricing service data. The investments under the funded  
  
   13 

Table of Contents  

deferred compensation plan are accounted for as trading securities and unrealized gains or losses are included in earnings. The fair value of investments in the funded deferred compensation plan are valued based on quoted market prices (Level 1).  
    
  The Company s financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, prepaid expenses and accounts payable (including income taxes payable and accrued expenses). The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value because of their short-term nature.  
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded unrealized losses on marketable securities of   $369,000   and for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded unrealized gains on marketable securities of   $198,000  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded unrealized gains of   $765,000   and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded unrealized gains of   $181,000  . 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received total proceeds from sales of available-for-sale municipal bonds, less the amount of interest received, of   $2,983,000   and   $1,858,000  , respectively. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , these sales resulted in realized   losses   of   $17,000   which were recorded in other income   investment and interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The basis for the sale of these securities was the specific identification of each bond sold during the period.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , there were   $2,000   in realized   gains  . 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we received total proceeds from sales of available-for-sale municipal bonds, less the amount of interest received, of   $8,137,000   and   $4,404,000  , respectively. These sales resulted in realized   gains   of   $226,000   and   $5,000  , respectively, and were recorded in other income   investment and interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) for all eligible employees. On August 1, 2016, the Company adopted an amendment to the ESPP, extending the program through 2021. All full-time and certain part-time employees who have completed   two   years of continuous service with us are eligible to participate. Annual offerings commence and terminate on the respective year s first and last calendar day.

Note 7  Dividends 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid regular quarterly cash dividends of approximately   $39,849,000   as follows:

  Cash dividends declared on our outstanding weighted average number of basic common shares for the periods presented were approximately as follows: 

Note 8  Income Taxes 
    
  The   2016   estimated annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately   36.5%  . Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate arise primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes and tax credits available to the Company. The actual   2016   effective tax rate could vary from the estimate depending on the availability of tax credits. 
    
  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which results in recognizing income tax expense based on the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Additionally, we evaluate regularly the tax positions taken or expected to be taken resulting from financial statement recognition of certain items. Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our financial statements. Our evaluation was performed for the tax years ended December 31, 2013 through 2015 (with regard to U.S. federal income tax returns) and December 31, 2011 through 2015 (with regard to various state and local income tax returns), the tax years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  We may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by taxing jurisdictions, although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. When we have received an assessment for interest and/or penalties, it has been classified in the financial statements as selling, general and administrative expense. In addition, any interest or penalties relating to recognized uncertain tax positions would also be recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.  

Note 9 Related Party Transactions 
    
  A director is a member of a law firm retained by us. In each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , fees received from us by such firm did not exceed   $120,000  . Additionally, such fees did not exceed, in either period,   5%   of such firm s or the Company s revenues.

Note 10 Segment Information 
    
  Reportable Operating Segments 
    
  We manage and evaluate our operations in   two   reportable segments: Housekeeping (housekeeping, laundry, linen and other services) and Dietary (dietary department services). Although both segments serve a similar client base and share many operational similarities, they are managed separately due to differences in the type of services provided, as well as the specialized expertise required of the professional management personnel responsible for delivering the respective segments  services. Such services are rendered pursuant to distinct service agreements, specific to each reportable segment.  
    
  The Company s accounting policies for the segments are generally the same as described in the Company s significant accounting policies. Differences between the reportable segments  operating results and other disclosed data and our consolidated financial statements relate primarily to corporate level transactions and recording of transactions at the reportable segment level which use methods other than generally accepted accounting principles. There are certain inventories and supplies that are primarily expensed when incurred within the operating segments, while they are capitalized for the consolidated financial statements. As discussed, most corporate expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Such expenses include corporate salary and benefit costs, bad debt expense, certain legal costs, information technology costs, depreciation, amortization of finite lived intangible assets, share based compensation costs and other corporate specific costs. Additionally, there are allocations for workers  compensation and general liability expense within the operating segments that differ from our actual expense recorded for U.S. GAAP.

  Total Revenues from Clients 
    
  We earned total revenues from clients in the following service categories:

Note 11  Earnings Per Common Share 
    
  Basic and diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of basic and diluted common shares outstanding, respectively. The weighted-average number of diluted common shares includes the impact of dilutive securities, including unvested, unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock. The table below reconciles the weighted-average basic and diluted common shares outstanding: 

Note 12  Other Contingencies 
    
  Line of Credit 
    
  We have a   $200,000,000   bank line of credit on which we may draw to meet short-term liquidity requirements. Amounts drawn under the line of credit are payable upon demand. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   borrowings under the line of credit. At   September 30, 2016  , we also had outstanding a   $78,078,000   irrevocable standby letter of credit, which relates to payment obligations under our insurance programs. In connection with the issuance of the letter of credit, the amount available under the line of credit was reduced by   $78,078,000   at   September 30, 2016  . The letter of credit was decreased to   $63,735,000   on October 25, 2016. The line of credit requires us to satisfy   one   financial covenant. We are in compliance with our financial covenant at   September 30, 2016   and expect to remain in compliance with such financial covenant. The line of credit expires on   December 18, 2018  . 
    
  Tax Jurisdictions and Matters 
    
  We provide our services in   48   states and are subject to numerous local taxing jurisdictions within those states. In the ordinary course of business, a jurisdiction may contest our reporting positions with respect to the application of its tax code to our services. A jurisdiction s conflicting position on the taxability of our services could result in additional tax liabilities. 
    
  We have tax matters with various taxing authorities. Because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcomes and amount of probable assessments due, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability. We do not expect the resolution of any of these matters, taken individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations based on our best estimate of the outcomes of such matters. 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. Some of these matters include payroll and employee-related matters and examinations by governmental agencies. As we become aware of such claims and legal actions, we record accruals for any exposures that are probable and estimable. If an adverse outcome of such claims and legal actions is reasonably possible, we assess materiality and provide such financial disclosure, as appropriate.  The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding or governmental examination that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. 
    
  Government Regulations 
    
  Our clients are concentrated in the health care industry and are  primarily providers of long-term care. Many of our clients  revenues are highly reliant on Medicare, Medicaid and third party payors  reimbursement funding rates. New legislation or additional changes in existing regulations could be made which could directly impact the governmental reimbursement programs in which  
  
   19

our clients participate. As a result, we may not know the full effects of such programs until these laws are fully implemented and government agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance.  

Note 13 Subsequent Events 
    
  We evaluated all subsequent events through the filing date of this Form 10-Q. We believe there were no events or transactions occurring during this subsequent reporting period which require recognition or additional disclosure in these financial statements. 

Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis     of Financial Condition and Results of     Operations 

Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion is intended to provide the reader with information that will be helpful in understanding our financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in comparing financial statements period to period. We also intend to provide the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as a summary of how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. In addition, we are providing information about the financial results of our two operating segments to further assist in understanding how these segments and their results affect our consolidated results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the notes accompanying those financial statements. 

Overview 
    
  We provide management, administrative and operating expertise and services to the housekeeping, laundry, linen, facility maintenance and dietary service departments of the health care industry, including nursing homes, retirement complexes, rehabilitation centers and hospitals located throughout the United States. We believe we are the largest provider of housekeeping and laundry management services to the long-term care industry in the United States, rendering such services to over   3,500   facilities in   48   states as of   September 30, 2016  . Although we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs, our clients  reimbursements are subject to government regulation. Therefore, our clients are directly affected by any legislation relating to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs. 
    
  We provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients. In such agreements, we are responsible for the day to day management of employees located at our clients  facilities. We also provide services on the basis of management-only agreements for a limited number of clients. Our agreements with clients typically provide for renewable one year service terms, cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days  notice after the initial 60 to 120 day period. 
    
  We are organized into two reportable segments; housekeeping, laundry, linen and other services ( Housekeeping ), and dietary department services ( Dietary ).  
    
  Housekeeping consists of managing the client s housekeeping department which is principally responsible for the cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing of patient rooms and common areas of a client s facility, as well as laundering and processing of the personal clothing belonging to the facility s patients. Also within the scope of Housekeeping is the responsibility for laundering and processing the bed linens, uniforms and other assorted linen items utilized by a client facility. 
    
  Dietary consists of managing the client s dietary department which is principally responsible for food purchasing, meal preparation and providing dietitian consulting professional services, which includes the development of a menu that meets the patients  dietary needs.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Housekeeping is provided at essentially all of our   3,500   client facilities, generating approximately   61.5%   or   $716,154,000   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Dietary is provided to over 1,000 client facilities at   September 30, 2016   and contributed approximately   38.5%   or   $447,943,000   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On July 12, 2015, the Company completed its corporate restructuring by capitalizing its three new operating entities (HCSG East, LLC, HCSG Central, LLC and HCSG West, LLC), and transitioning the Company s facility-based employees to such entities based on the geography served. As of July 12, 2015, (i) HCSG Insurance provided workers  compensation and other insurance coverages to such entities with respect to such transitioned workforce, (ii) such entities provide housekeeping, laundry and dietary services as a subcontracted provider to the Company, and (iii) the Company provides strategic client-service management and administrative support services to such entities.

Subject to the factors noted in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although there can be no assurance thereof, our financial performance for the remainder of   2016   may be comparable to historical ranges as they relate to consolidated revenues. Specifically, each of Housekeeping s and Dietary s revenues, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, should approximate the respective percentages noted in the Overview Section above. Furthermore, we expect the sources of organic growth for the remainder of   2016   for the respective operating segments to be primarily the same as historically experienced. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance thereof, the growth in Dietary is expected to come from our current Housekeeping client base, while growth in Housekeeping will primarily come from obtaining new clients. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The following tables sets forth the   third quarter 2016   income statement key components that we use to evaluate our financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis compared to   third quarter 2015   amounts. The differences between the reportable segments  operating results and other disclosed data and our consolidated financial statements relate primarily to corporate level transactions and recording of transactions at the reportable segment level which use methods other than generally accepted accounting principles. 

Housekeeping, our largest and core reportable segment, represented approximately   61.0%   of consolidated revenues for the   third quarter 2016  . Dietary revenues represented approximately   39.0%   of consolidated revenues for the   third quarter 2016  .

Revenues 
    
  Consolidated 
    
  Consolidated revenues increased   9.0%   to   $392,734,000   in the   third quarter 2016   compared to   $360,165,000   in the   third quarter 2015   as a result of the factors discussed below under Reportable Segments. 
    
  Reportable Segments 
    
  Housekeeping s   5.2%   net growth in reportable segment revenues resulted from service agreements entered into with new clients.   
    
  Dietary s   15.7%   net growth in reportable segment revenues resulted primarily from providing this service to a greater number of existing Housekeeping clients. 

Costs of Services Provided 
    
  Consolidated 
    
  Consolidated costs of services   increased     9.0%   to   $336,340,000   in the   third quarter 2016   compared to   $308,645,000   in the   third quarter 2015  . The increase in costs of services is a direct result of growth in our consolidated revenues. Certain significant components within our costs of services are subject to fluctuation with the changes in our business and client base. The increase during   2016   compared to   2015   relates primarily to labor and other labor related costs. Historically, labor and other labor related costs, as well as self insurance costs, accounted for approximately 96% to 98% of consolidated costs of services. 
    
  As a percentage of consolidated revenues, cost of services   decreased   to   85.6%   in the   third quarter 2016   from   85.7%   in the   third quarter 2015  . The following table provides a comparison of the key indicators we consider when managing the consolidated cost of services provided: 

The   decrease   in workers  compensation and general liability insurance expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue is primarily the result of the Company s ongoing initiatives to promote safety and accident prevention in the workplace, as well as proactive management of workers  compensation claims, which positively impact our claims experience.  
    
  Reportable Segments 
    
  Cost of services provided for Housekeeping, as a percentage of Housekeeping revenues for the   third quarter 2016     decreased   to   90.1%   from   90.4%   in the   third quarter 2015  . Cost of services provided for Dietary, as a percentage of Dietary revenues for the   third quarter 2016     increased   to   94.9%   from   93.8%   in the   third quarter 2015  .

The following table provides a comparison of the key indicators we consider when managing cost of services at the segment level, as a percentage of the respective segment s revenues: 

The ratios of these key indicators to revenue remain relatively consistent. Variations relate to the provision of services at new facilities and changes in the mix of clients for whom we provide supplies or do not provide supplies. Management focuses on building efficiencies and managing labor and other costs at the facility level, as well as managing supply chain costs, for new and existing facilities.   

Selling, General and Administrative Expense    

(1)     
    Selling, general and administrative expense excluding the change in the market value of the deferred compensation fund. 
       
  Excluding the change in the deferred compensation plan, consolidated selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $1,428,000   or   5.7%   compared to the   third quarter 2015  , related primarily to growth. The   increase   related to the deferred compensation plan is a result of changes in the value of our deferred compensation liability.  

Consolidated Investment and Interest Income 
    
  Investment and interest income, as a percentage of consolidated revenues,   increased   to   0.3%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   period, primarily due to   favorable   market fluctuations in the value of our investments. 

Consolidated Income Taxes 
    
  For the   third quarter 2016   and   2015  , our effective tax rate was   36%  . Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate arise primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes and tax credits available to the Company.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense 

(1)     
    Selling, general and administrative expense excluding the change in the market value of the deferred compensation fund. 
       
  Excluding the change in the deferred compensation plan, consolidated selling, general and administrative expense   increased     $721,000   or   0.9%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , related primarily to growth. The   increase   related to the deferred compensation plan is a result of changes in the value of our deferred compensation liability. 

Consolidated Investment and Interest Income 
    
  Investment and interest income, as a percentage of consolidated revenues,   increased   to   0.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   period, primarily due to   favorable   market fluctuations in the value of our investments. 

Consolidated Income Taxes 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our effective tax rate was   36.5%   compared to   37.4%   for the   2015   period. Differences between the effective tax rate and the applicable U.S. federal statutory rate arise primarily from the effect of state and local income taxes and tax credits available to the Company. The   decrease   in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the recognition of certain tax credits in the   third quarter 2016   that had not been recognized in the   third quarter 2015  , as the credits were not approved until late   2015  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash generated through operations is our primary source of liquidity. At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of   $104,950,000   and working capital of   $308,799,000  , compared to   December 31, 2015   cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of   $102,685,000   and working capital of   $269,277,000  . Our current ratio was   3.7   to 1 at   September 30, 2016   versus   3.8   to 1 at   December 31, 2015  . The   increase   in working capital is driven by the timing of payments and cash receipts as of   September 30, 2016   as compared with   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  We have a   $200,000,000   bank line of credit on which we may draw to meet short-term liquidity requirements in excess of internally generated cash flow. Amounts drawn under the line of credit are payable upon demand. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no borrowings under the line of credit. At   September 30, 2016  , we also had outstanding a   $78,078,000   irrevocable standby letter of credit, which relates to payment obligations under our insurance programs. In connection with the issuance of the letter of credit, the amount available under the line of credit was reduced by   $78,078,000   at   September 30, 2016  . The letter of credit was decreased to   $63,735,000   on October 25, 2016.  
    
  The line of credit requires us to satisfy one financial covenant. The covenant and its respective status at   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

(1)   
    All indebtedness for borrowed money, including but not limited to capitalized lease obligations, reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit and guaranties of any such indebtedness. 
               (2)   
    Net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization and extraordinary non-recurring losses/gains. 
       
  As noted above, we were in compliance with our financial covenant at   September 30, 2016   and we expect to remain in compliance. The line of credit expires on December 18, 2018.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings, excluding the impact of non-cash items, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, and changes in working capital items.  
    
  The net cash provided by our operating activities was   $37,898,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The principal source of net cash flows from operating activities for the period was net income of   $57,097,000  , adjusted for non-cash charges to operations for   depreciation and amortization, provision for bad debts, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation  , which totaled   $14,693,000  . Cash was also provided by increases in   accrued payroll and accrued and withheld payroll taxes   of   $22,065,000  ,   income taxes payable   of   $7,870,000  ,   accrued insurance claims   of   $4,870,000   and our   deferred compensation liability   of    2,284,000  . These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in   accounts and notes receivable   of   $54,954,000  ,   prepaid expenses and other assets   of   $5,279,000   and   inventories and supplies   of   $1,295,000   and a decrease in   accounts payable and other accrued expenses   of   $6,774,000  .  
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Cash flows from investing activities are related to capital expenditures and our investments in marketable securities.  
    
  The net cash used in our investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $14,345,000  , primarily attributable to   $10,614,000   of net purchases of marketable securities and   $3,908,000   for the purchase of property and equipment. See  Capital Expenditures  below. 
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to dividends paid and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  
    
  The net cash used in financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily related to   $39,849,000   in dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds of   $5,600,000   from the exercise of stock options by employees and directors. Additionally, as a result of tax deductions derived from the stock option exercises, we recognized an income tax benefit of   $1,750,000  . 
    
  The dividends paid to shareholders during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were funded by the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $104,950,000   and   $102,685,000  , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our Board of Directors reviews our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Although there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or the amount of the dividend, we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. In connection with the establishment of our dividend policy, we adopted a Dividend Reinvestment Plan in 2003. 
    
  Accounts and Notes Receivable 
    
  We expend considerable effort to collect the amounts due for our services on the terms agreed upon with our clients. Many of our clients participate in programs funded by federal and state governmental agencies which historically have encountered delays in making payments to their program participants. Whenever possible, when a client falls behind in making agreed-upon payments to us, we convert the unpaid accounts receivable to interest bearing promissory notes. The promissory notes receivable provide a means by which to further evidence the amounts owed and provide a definitive repayment plan and therefore may ultimately enhance our ability to collect the amounts due. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $16,353,000   and   $16,830,000  , net of reserves, respectively, of such promissory notes outstanding. Additionally, we consider restructuring service agreements from full service to management-only service in the case of certain clients experiencing financial difficulties. We believe that such restructurings may provide us with a means to maintain a relationship with the client while at the same time minimizing collection exposure. 
    
  We have had varying collections experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable. When contractual terms are not met, we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients. Therefore, we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms. These clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties. In order to provide for these collection problems and the general risk associated with the granting of credit terms, we have recorded bad debt provisions (in an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) of   $3,200,000   and   $2,225,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As a percentage of total revenues, these provisions represent   0.3%   and   0.2%   for the respective periods. In making our credit evaluations, in addition to analyzing and anticipating, where possible, the specific cases described above, we consider the general collection  
  
   27

risk associated with trends in the long-term care industry. We also establish credit limits, perform ongoing credit evaluation and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss. Notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure, our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows. If our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  The level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the number of new clients obtained. Such capital expenditures primarily consist of housekeeping equipment purchases, laundry and linen equipment installations, and computer hardware and software. Although we have no specific material commitments for capital expenditures through the end of calendar year   2016  , we estimate that for the remainder of   2016   we will have capital expenditures of approximately   $1,125,000   to   $1,500,000   in connection with housekeeping equipment purchases and laundry and linen equipment installations in our clients  facilities, as well as expenditures relating to internal data processing hardware and software requirements, computer equipment and office equipment. We believe that our cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents balance and credit line will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations and to fund our anticipated growth. However, should these sources not be sufficient, we would, if necessary, seek to obtain necessary working capital from such sources as long-term debt or equity financing. 
    
  Material Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, other than our irrevocable standby letter of credit previously discussed.

Item 3.       Quantitative and Qualitative     Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $104,950,000   in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The fair value of all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on  Level 1  or  Level 2  inputs, which are based upon quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. 
    
  Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate investments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if there is a decline in the fair value of our investments. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), such as this Form 10-Q, is reported in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Disclosure controls are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Based on their evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act  
  13a-15(e)) are effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
    
  In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, no changes during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various administrative and legal proceedings, including labor and employment, contracts, personal injury, and insurance matters. The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding or governmental examination that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could become material to the Company s results of operations for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of the Company s operating income for that period. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors
