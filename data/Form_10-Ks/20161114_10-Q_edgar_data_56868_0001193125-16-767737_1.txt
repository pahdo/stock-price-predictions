S TATEMENTS      September 30, 2016  
 (Unaudited)     (1) Basis of Presentation:
    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of PrimeEnergy Corporation ( PEC  or the  Company )
have not been audited by independent public accountants. Pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and regulations, the accompanying interim financial statements do not include all disclosures presented in
annual financial statements and the reader should refer to the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements contain all
material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the condensed consolidated
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the condensed consolidated results of cash flows and equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain amounts presented in
prior period financial statements have been reclassified for consistency with current period presentation. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results. For purposes of disclosure in the condensed consolidated
financial statements, subsequent events have been evaluated through the date the statements were issued.      Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements:      The FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU supersedes the
 Revenue recognition  requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605.  Extractivies   Oil and Gas Revenue Recognition.  This ASU provides guidance concerning the recognition and
measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to increase the usefulness of information in the financial statements regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was delayed
through the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral or the  Effective Date,  to annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using either the retrospective or cumulative
effect (modified retrospective) transition method, with early adoption permitted in 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not plan on early adopting.
   The FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.    This ASU provides
additional guidance to reporting entities in evaluating whether certain legal entities such, as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures, should be consolidated. The ASU is considered to be an improvement on
current accounting requirements as it reduces the number of existing consolidation models. This ASU adopted by the Company beginning January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.    The FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Topic 835): Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs  and ASU 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Topic 835): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  These ASU s require debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability, except for those related to revolving credit facilities, to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than an asset. These ASU s
adopted by the Company beginning January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 The FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.    This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets
and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively, with early
adoption permitted. This ASU was early-adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2016 and applied retrospectively, and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and related disclosures.  
 The FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  This ASU requires lessee recognition on the balance sheet of a right-of-use asset and
a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. It further requires recognition in the income statement of a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a
generally straight-line basis. Finally, it requires classification of all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is
permitted. This ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements and related disclosures.

   (2) Acquisitions and Dispositions:   
 Historically the Company has repurchased the interests of the partners and trust unit holders in the eighteen oil and gas limited partnerships
(the  Partnerships ) and the two asset and business income trusts (the  Trusts ) managed by the Company as general partner and as managing trustee, respectively. The Company purchased such interests in amounts totaling $187,000
and $101,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company has sold or farmed out interests in certain undeveloped oil and natural gas properties through a number of separate, individually negotiated transactions in exchange for cash and a royalty or working interest in both West Texas and
Oklahoma. Proceeds under these agreements are $28 million. The Company has entered into an agreement to sell additional acreage for an additional $4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  (3) Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents:   
 Restricted cash and cash equivalents include $3.1 million and $3.51 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, of cash primarily pertaining to oil and gas revenue payments. There were corresponding accounts payable recorded at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for these liabilities. Both the restricted cash and the accounts
payable are classified as current on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.     (4) Additional Balance Sheet Information:   
 Certain balance sheet amounts are comprised of the following:

   (5) Property and Equipment:   
 Property and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  
   
    (6) Debt:   
   Bank Debt:    
 Effective July 30, 2010 the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between Compass Bank as agent and a
syndicated group of lenders ( Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement has a revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility of up to $250 million with a final maturity date of July 30, 2017. The credit facility is secured by
substantially all of the Company s oil and gas properties. The credit facility is subject to a borrowing base determined by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of PEC s oil and gas properties in accordance with the
lenders  customary practices for oil and gas loans. This process involves reviewing PEC s estimated proved reserves and their valuation. The borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually, and the available borrowing amount could be
increased or decreased as a result of such redetermination. In addition, PEC and the lenders each have at their discretion the right to request the borrowing base be redetermined with a maximum of one such request each year. A revision to PEC s
reserves may prompt such a request on the part of the lenders, which could possibly result in a reduction in the borrowing base and availability under the credit facility. At any time if the sum of the outstanding borrowings and letter of credit
exposures exceed the applicable portion of the borrowing base, PEC would be required to repay the excess amount within a prescribed period.  
 At September 30, 2016, the credit facility borrowing base was $80 million with no required monthly reduction amount. The borrowings made
within the credit facility may be placed in a base rate loan or LIBO rate loan. The Company s borrowing rates in the credit facility provide for base rate loans at the prime rate (3.5% at September 30, 2016) plus applicable margin
utilization rates that range from 1.75% to 2.50%, and LIBO rate loans at LIBO published rates plus applicable utilization rates (2.75% to 3.50% at September 30, 2016). At September 30, 2016, the Company had in place one LIBO rate loan with
an effective rate of 3.77%.    At September 30, 2016, the Company had a total of $65 million of borrowings outstanding under its
revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.49% and $15 million available for future borrowings. The combined weighted average interest rate paid on outstanding bank borrowings subject to base rate and LIBO interest was 3.82%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 3.39% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s borrowings under its current credit facility are considered short term debt as the maturity date of the
facility is July 30, 2017.    The Company entered into interest rate hedge agreements to help manage interest rate exposure. These contracts
include interest rate swaps. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. In July 2012, the Company entered into
interest swap agreements for a period of two years, which commenced in January 2014, related to $75 million of the Company s bank debt resulting in a LIBO fixed rate of 0.563% and terminated in January 2016. The Company recorded interest
expense and paid $7,000 and $217,000 related to the settlement of interest rate swaps for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   Equipment Loans:    
 On July 31, 2013, the Company entered into a $10.0 million Loan and Security Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank ( Equipment
Loan ). The Equipment Loan is secured by a portion of the Company s field service equipment, carries an interest rate of 3.95% per annum, requires monthly payments (principal and interest) of $184,000, and has a final maturity date of
July 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a total of $3.38 million outstanding on this Equipment Loan.  
      10  

Table of Contents  

  On July 29, 2014, the Company entered into additional equipment financing facilities
( Additional Equipment Loans ) totaling $6.0 million with JP Morgan Chase Bank. In August 2014, the Company drew down $4.8 million of this facility that is secured by field service equipment, carries an interest rate of 3.40% per
annum, requires monthly payments (principal and interest) of $87,800, and has a final maturity date of July 31, 2019. The remaining $1.2 million under the Additional Equipment Loans was available for interim draws to finance the acquisition of
any future field service equipment. In December 2014, the Company made an interim draw of an additional $0.5 million on this facility that is secured by recently purchased field service equipment. Interim draws on this facility carried a floating
interest rate, payable monthly at the LIBO published rate plus 2.50% and on June 26, 2015 converted into a fixed term loan requiring monthly payments (principal and interest) of $8,700 with a final maturity date of June 26, 2020. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had a total of $2.95 million outstanding on the Additional Equipment Loans. On September 22, 2016, with the lenders permission, the Company made any required installment payments due for the fourth quarter. The
Company paid all installment payments through December 31, 2016.     (7) Other Long-Term Obligations and Commitments:   
   Operating Leases:    
 The Company has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for rental of office space, that have a term of more than one year. The
future minimum lease payments for the rest of fiscal 2015 and thereafter for the operating leases are as follows:      
   Rent expense for office space for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $677,000 and
571,000, respectively.      Asset Retirement Obligation:    
 A reconciliation of the liability for plugging and abandonment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:  
   
   The Company s liability is determined using significant assumptions, including current estimates of
plugging and abandonment costs, annual inflation of these costs, the productive life of wells and a risk-adjusted interest rate. Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation.
Revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties, resulting in prospective changes to depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount. Because of the subjectivity
of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of the Company s wells, the costs to ultimately retire the wells may vary significantly from previous estimates.  
  (8) Contingent Liabilities:     The Company,
as managing general partner of the affiliated Partnerships, is responsible for all Partnership activities, including the drilling of development wells and the production and sale of oil and gas from productive wells. The Company also provides the
administration, accounting and tax preparation work for the Partnerships, and is liable for all debts and liabilities of the affiliated Partnerships, to the extent that the assets of a given limited Partnership are not sufficient to satisfy its
obligations. As of September 30, 2016, the affiliated Partnerships have established cash reserves in excess of their debts and liabilities and the Company believes these reserves will be sufficient to satisfy Partnership obligations.  
 The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations. Management believes that future expenses, before recoveries from third parties,
if any, will not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition. This opinion is based on expenses incurred to date for remediation and compliance with laws and regulations, which have not been material to the Company s
results of operations.  
      11  

Table of Contents  

  From time to time, the Company is party to certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of business. While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect these matters to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.  
  (9) Stock Options and Other Compensation:   
 In May 1989, non-statutory stock options were granted by the Company to four key executive officers for the purchase of shares of common stock.
At September 30, 2016 and 2015, remaining options held by two key executive officers on 767,500 shares were outstanding and exercisable at prices ranging from $1.00 to $1.25. According to their terms, the options have no expiration date.  
  (10) Related Party Transactions:     The
Company, as managing general partner or managing trustee, makes an annual offer to repurchase the interests of the partners and trust unit holders in certain of the Partnerships or Trusts. The Company purchased such interests in amounts totaling
$187,000 and $101,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Treasury stock purchases in any reported
period may include shares from a related party, which may include members of the Company s Board of Directors. In 2016, the Company purchased 10,000 shares from a related party  
 Receivables from related parties consist of reimbursable general and administrative costs, lease operating expenses and reimbursement for
property development and related costs. These receivables are due from joint venture partners, which may include members of the Company s Board of Directors.  
 Payables owed to related parties primarily represent receipts collected by the Company as agent for the joint venture partners, which may
include members of the Company s Board of Directors, for oil and gas sales net of expenses.     (11) Financial Instruments:   
   Fair Value Measurements:    
 Authoritative guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and stipulates the
related disclosure requirements. The Company follows a three-level hierarchy, prioritizing and defining the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair values of the Company s interest rate swaps, natural gas and crude oil price
collars and swaps are designated as Level 3. The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015:      
 
      12  

Table of Contents  

  The derivative contracts were measured based on quotes from the Company s counterparties.
Such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil, volatility factors and interest
rates, such as a LIBOR curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable. These estimates are verified using comparable NYMEX futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for
reasonableness.    The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 derivative contracts include basis differentials and volatility factors.
An increase (decrease) in these unobservable inputs would result in an increase (decrease) in fair value, respectively. The Company does not have access to the specific assumptions used in its counterparties  valuation models. Consequently,
additional disclosures regarding significant Level 3 unobservable inputs were not provided.    The following table sets forth a
reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

(a) 
 Derivative instruments are reported in revenues as realized gain/loss and on a separately reported line item captioned unrealized gain/loss on derivative instruments, and interest rate swap instruments are reported as
an increase or reduction to interest expense.        Derivative Instruments:    
 The Company is exposed to commodity price and interest rate risk, and management considers periodically the Company s exposure to cash
flow variability resulting from the commodity price changes and interest rate fluctuations. Futures, swaps and options are used to manage the Company s exposure to commodity price risk inherent in the Company s oil and gas production
operations. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its commodity based derivatives. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.  
 Interest rate swap derivatives continue to be treated as cash-flow hedges and are used to fix our float interest rates on existing debt. The
value of these interest rate swaps at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are located, if applicable, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Settlements of the swaps, which began in January 2014 and concluded in January 2016,
are recognized within interest expense.

assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  
 The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.  
  OVERVIEW     We are the operator of
substantially all of our undeveloped acreage the majority of which is currently held by production. We have historically sold or farmed-out acreage to supplement cashflow and finance our drilling program. Proceeds from these transactions through
September 30, 2016 were approximately $28 million and during the fourth quarter of 2016 we have closed on transactions for an additional $4 million.  
 Subsequent to these transactions we maintain an acreage position of over 24,600 gross (14,900 net) acres in the Permian Basin in West Texas,
primarily in Reagan, Upton, Martin and Midland counties. We believe this acreage has significant resource potential in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp intervals for drilling opportunities. Our Oklahoma acreage position consists of over 15,000 net acres
in 15 counties, with over 4,500 net acres in Kingfisher, Canadian, Grady and Grant counties. Additionally, our producing properties in West Virginia hold approximately 33,000 net acres and our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain Districts maintain
approximately 13,000 net acres held by production.    We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in acquiring, developing and
producing oil and natural gas. We presently own producing and non-producing properties located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado and Louisiana. In addition, we own well servicing equipment. All of our oil and gas
properties and interests are located in the United States. Assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long-lived reserves and significant development opportunities.  
 We believe our balanced portfolio of assets positions us well for both the current commodity price environment and future potential upside as
we develop our attractive resource opportunities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations, through our producing oil and gas properties, field services business and sales of acreage.

  Our cash flows depend on many factors, including the price of oil and gas, the success of our
acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties. We may use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk. This practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of any increases in
oil and gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreements and subjects us to the credit risk of the counterparties to such agreements.  
  RECENT ACTIVITIES     We began our West
Texas, Upton County horizontal drilling program during 2015 and through the third quarter of 2016 we have drilled 5 wells in this phase. Discussions with our joint venture partner in that program, Apache Corporation, indicate that including
additional phases of development the program will result in approximately 60 horizontal wells being drilled at a cost of approximately $470 million. We own various interests, ranging from 16% up to 50% interest in the lands to be developed in the
program, and expect our share of these capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. The actual number of wells to be drilled and the timing of the drilling may vary based on commodity market conditions. Apache drilling plans indicated two
of these wells will be drilled later this year at a cost of $12.6 million, of which our share is $4.5 million. The latest well drilled commenced production July 17, 2016 and is currently producing on an ESP at approximately 850 barrels of oil
and 1,500 Mcf of gas per day.    We are also participating in the drilling of six other West Texas horizontal wells in which we hold a 4.15%
interest and expect our share of drilling and completion costs to be $1 million. Currently four of those wells are awaiting completion and two are in their final drilling stage.  
 During 2016 we commenced our Martin County, Texas horizontal drilling program, operated by RSP Permian, two wells have been drilled and are
currently producing. One well was placed on production June 21, 2016 and   the second well was placed on production July 7, 2016. Two additional wells are currently in the drilling phase and we expect them to be completed in the first
quarter of 2017 at a total cost of approximately $13 million, of which our share is $4.4 million.    In our Oklahoma drilling program the
Sun Up well, operated by Devon Energy, was spudded on June 6, 2016 and is currently awaiting completion. We have a 26.65% working interest in this well and expect our share of the drilling and completion costs to be approximately $1.8
million. Also, the Red Square well was spudded on November 5, 2016 and is currently drilling. We have a 17.66% working interest in this well and expect our share of the drilling and completion costs to be approximately $1.12 million  
 To supplement cashflow and finance our drilling program we have sold or farmed out certain acreage in exchange for cash and a
royalty or working interest in both West Texas and Oklahoma. Through September 30, 2016 proceeds under these agreements were approximately $28 million and during the fourth quarter of 2016 we have closed on transactions for an additional $4 million.
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       2016 and 2015 Compared
     We reported net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $4.9 million, or $2.15 per share and $5.6
million, or $2.44 per share, respectively as compared to net losses of $0.7 million, or $0.28 per share and $2.6 million, or $1.11 per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Net income increased by $5.6 million
or 852% and $8.2 million or 317% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods during 2015 primarily due to the combination of decreased oil and gas sales related to decreased commodity prices realized
in 2016 and gains on the sale of non-core acreage.    The significant components of net income are discussed below.  
   Oil and gas sales   increased $1 million, or 9% from $10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $11.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and decreased $9.8 million, or 26% from $37 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Crude oil and natural gas sales vary due to
changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Our realized prices at the well head decreased an average of $1.95 per barrel, or 4% and $10.27 per barrel, or 21% on crude oil during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively from the same periods in 2015 while our average well head price for natural gas increased $0.17 per mcf, or 6.5% and decreased $0.34 per mcf, or 12% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively from the
same periods in 2015.

  Our crude oil production increased by 28,000 barrels, or 16% from 171,000 barrels for the third
quarter 2015 to 199,000 barrels for the third quarter 2016 and decreased by 53,000 barrels, or 10% from 564,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 511,000 barrels for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our natural gas production
decreased by 27,000 mcf, or 2% from 1,151,000 mcf for the third quarter 2015 to 1,124,000 mcf for the third quarter 2016 and decreased by 297,000 mcf, or 8% from 3,605,000 mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3,308,000 mcf for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. In general our production volumes remained flat as production from new wells offset the natural decline of existing properties. Fluctuations in production volumes reflect the combination of new production from
our recent horizontal drilling activity combined with the natural decline of existing properties and the shut-in of marginal properties.  
 The following table summarizes the primary components of production volumes and average sales prices realized for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (excluding realized gains and losses from derivatives).      
     Realized gain (loss)   on derivative instruments, net include net gains of $0.40 million and $4.79
million on the settlements of natural gas and crude oil derivatives, respectively for the third quarter 2015. Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments include net losses of $2.06 million and $12.88 million on the settlements of natural gas and
crude oil derivatives, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No such gains or losses were recognized in 2016.    We do
not apply hedge accounting to any of our commodity based derivatives, thus changes in the fair market value of commodity contracts held at the end of a reported period, referred to as mark-to-market adjustments, are recognized as unrealized gains
and losses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. As oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, we recognized net unrealized losses of $0.48 million and $1.48 million, respectively associated with natural gas fixed swap contracts and net unrealized losses of $1.67 million and $9.77 million, respectively associated with crude oil
fixed swaps and collars due to market fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil futures market prices between December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized net
unrealized losses of $0.35 million associated with natural gas fixed swap contracts and crude oil fixed swaps entered into during the third quarter of 2016.  
   Field service income   decreased $1.8 million, or 32.9% from $5.51 million for the third quarter 2015 to $3.7 million for the
third quarter 2016 and $4.9 million, or 30% from $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This is a combined result of slightly reduced utilization and the market
requiring us to charge lower rates to customers during the 2016 periods. Workover rig services represent the bulk of our field service operations, and while we were able to keep our rigs utilized during 2016, working rates have all decreased between
the periods in our most active districts.      Lease operating expense   decreased $2.5 million, or 29% from $8.8 million for the
third quarter 2015 to $6.3 million for the third quarter 2016 and decreased $5.3 million, or 20% from $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $21.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These decreases result from
the industry wide costs saving measures implemented in response to the current commodity price environment. Where possible we have reduced company labor and support costs and have been successful in reducing costs with service vendors.  
   Field service expense   decreased $2 million, or 43% from $4.7 million for the third quarter 2015 to $2.7 million for the third
quarter 2016 and $4 million, or 29% from $13.55 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Field service expenses primarily consist of salaries and vehicle operating expenses
which have decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period of 2015 as a direct result of decreased services and utilization of the equipment.

    Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion on discounted liabilities  
increased $1.7 million, or 29% from $5.6 million for the third quarter 2015 to $7.3 million for the third quarter 2016 and increased $2.1 million, or 12.5% from $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $18.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. These increases are related to the cost basis and production related to our recent horizontal drilling program.  
   General and administrative expense   decreased $.4 million, or 14% from $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015
to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $2.6 million, or 28% from $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease in 2016 reflects the
cost cutting measures including reductions in workforce put in place throughout 2015 and 2016 and the reimbursement of administrative expenses associated with property activities. The largest component of these personnel costs are salaries and
employee related taxes and insurance.      Gain on sale and exchange of assets   of $26.9 million and $1.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively consists of sales of oil and gas interests.      Interest
expense   increased $0.12 million, or 14% from $0.88 million for the third quarter 2015 to $1 million for the third quarter 2016 and $0.62 million, or 2% from $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. This increase reflects higher interest rates in the current periods.      A Tax
Provision   of $13.9 million, or an effective rate of approximately 22% was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus a tax benefit of $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our provision for income
taxes can vary from the federal statutory tax rate of 34% primarily due to state taxes and percentage depletion deductions. We are entitled to percentage depletion on certain of our wells, which is calculated without reference to the basis of the
property. To the extent that such depletion exceeds a property s basis, it creates a permanent difference, which would have the effect of lowering our effective rate.  
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Our
primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations, through our producing oil and gas properties, field services business and sales of acreage.  
 Net cash provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.96 million compared $13.84 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income, our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in
working capital accounts. Our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control.  
 Our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events, supply and demand of products, product storage levels, and weather
patterns. We sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices. Accordingly, product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations. To mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production
through the use of derivatives.    If our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries, we will have to expend additional
capital in order to finance the completion, development, and potential additional opportunities generated by our success. We believe that, because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in
recent years, we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through bank financing.    We currently maintain a credit facility
totaling $250 million, with a borrowing base of $80 million and $15 million in availability at September 30, 2016. The bank reviews the borrowing base semi-annually and, at their discretion, may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base
relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves. The next borrowing base review is scheduled for December 2016. Our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial
and operational covenants defined in the agreement. We are currently in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance over the next twelve months. If we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis, the lenders have the
right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and/or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices, operating difficulties, declines in
reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for other reasons set forth in our revolving credit agreement. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, our
ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base.

  Our most recent amendment to our credit agreement, effective July 22, 2016, required us to hedge
a portion of our production as forecasted for our PDP reserves in our Spring borrowing base review engineering report for the period from November 2016 through December 2018. Accordingly in July 2016 the Company entered into the following swap
agreements for oil and natural gas.      
   Maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity are key components of our business strategy. For 2016,
we will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. Our 2016 capital budget is reflective of decreased commodity prices and has been established based on an expectation of
available cash flows, with any cash flow deficiencies expected to be funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we have done historically to preserve or enhance liquidity we may adjust our capital program throughout the year,
divest assets, or enter into strategic joint ventures. We are actively in discussions with financial partners for funding to develop our asset base and, if required, pay down our revolving credit facility should our borrowing base become limited due
to the deterioration of commodity prices.    Due to the uncertainty of financing availability we have removed all but one PUD location from
our yearend reserve report in accordance with the SEC rules governing the scheduling of the drilling of PUD reserves within 5 years. The one PUD included in our report was drilled in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our joint venture with Apache
Corporation in Upton County, Texas.    We began our West Texas, Upton County horizontal drilling program during 2015 and through the third
quarter of 2016 we have drilled 5 wells in this phase. Discussions with our joint venture partner in that program, Apache Corporation, indicate that including additional phases of development the program will result in approximately 60 horizontal
wells being drilled at a cost of approximately $470 million. We own various interests, ranging from 16% up to 50% interest in the lands to be developed in the program, and expect our share of these capital expenditures to be approximately $120
million. The actual number of wells to be drilled and the timing of the drilling may vary based on commodity market conditions. Apache drilling plans indicated two of these wells will be drilled later this year at a cost of $12.6 million, of which
our share is $4.5 million. The latest well drilled commenced production July 17, 2016 and is currently producing on an ESP at approximately 850 barrels of oil and 1,500 Mcf of gas per day.  
 We are also participating in the drilling of six other West Texas horizontal wells in which we hold a 4.15% interest and expect our share of
drilling and completion costs to be $1 million. Currently four of those wells are awaiting completion and two are in their final drilling stage.    During
2016 we commenced our Martin County, Texas horizontal drilling program, operated by RSP Permian, two wells have been drilled and are currently producing. One well was placed on production June 21, 2016 and the second well was placed on production
July 7, 2016. Two additional wells are currently in the drilling phase and we expect them to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 at a cost of approximately $13 million, of which our share is $4.4 million.  
 In our Oklahoma drilling program the Sun Up well, operated by Devon Energy, was spudded on June 6, 2016 and is currently awaiting completion.
We have a 26.65% working interest in this well and expect our share of the drilling and completion costs to be approximately $1.8 million. Also, the Red Square well was spudded on November 5, 2016 and is currently drilling. We have a 17.66% working
interest in this well and expect our share of the drilling and completion costs to be approximately $1.12 million
