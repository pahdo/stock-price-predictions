1.       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
    
  Rand Logistics, Inc. (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is a leading provider of bulk freight shipping services throughout the Great Lakes region. The Company believes that it is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region. The Company maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in 
  Canada, respectively. 

2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
     Basis of presentation and consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of Rand Finance Corp. ( Rand Finance ), Rand LL Holdings Corp. ("Rand LL Holdings") and Black Creek Shipping Holding Company, Inc. ("Black Creek Holdings"), wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, the accounts of Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. ("Lower Lakes Towing"), Lower Lakes Transportation Company ("Lower Lakes Transportation") and Grand River Navigation Company, Inc. ("Grand River"), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rand LL Holdings, Black Creek Shipping Company, Inc. ("Black Creek"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Black Creek Holdings, and Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. ("Lower Lakes Ship Repair") and Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. ("Lower Lakes (17)"), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing.  
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, the interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary (consisting of normal recurring accruals) to present fairly the financial information contained herein. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, in part due to the seasonal nature of the business. The comparative consolidated balance sheet amounts and the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the year ended March 31, 2016 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. As discussed in Note 3, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 has been retroactively reclassified in connection with a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements that were included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  

Cash and cash equivalents 
    
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of   three months or less   to be cash equivalents.

2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
       
  Accounts receivable  
    
  The majority of the Company s accounts receivable are amounts due from customers and other accounts receivable, including insurance and harmonized sales tax refunds.  The majority of accounts receivable are due within   30 to 60 days   and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company extends credit to its customers based upon its assessment of their creditworthiness and past payment history.  Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. 
    
  Revenue and operating expenses recognition    
    
  The Company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment (voyage charters) generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin-destination and cargo carried. Voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage, which average from 2 to 3 days, based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met:  the Company has a signed contract of affreightment, the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  Included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges, which represent pass-through charges to customers for toll fees, lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties.  Fuel surcharges are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage, while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred. Freight surcharges are less than 5% of total revenue for all periods presented.      
    
  Marine operating costs included in vessel operating expenses such as crewing costs, fuel, tugs and insurance are recognized as incurred or consumed and thereby are recognized ratably in each reporting period. Repairs and maintenance and certain other insignificant costs are recognized as incurred.     
    
  The Company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers.  Service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers.  Consequently, revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above.  Costs for subcontracted freight providers, presented as  outside voyage charter fees  in the consolidated statements of operations, are recognized as incurred and therefore are recognized ratably over the voyage.     
    
  The Company accounts for sales taxes imposed on its services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations.    
    
  In addition, all revenues are presented on a gross basis.    
    
  Vessel acquisitions    
    
  Vessels are stated at cost, which consists of the purchase price and any material incremental expenditures incurred upon acquisition, such as initial repairs, improvements, delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage. Subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life, increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. Significant financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are also capitalized and included in the vessels' cost.     
    
  Fuel and lubricant inventories    
    
  Raw materials, fuel and certain operating supplies are accounted for on a first-in, first-out cost method (based on monthly averages). Raw materials and fuel are stated at the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or market and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Operating supplies are stated at actual cost or average cost and are recognized in expenses as they are consumed.

2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
       
  Intangible assets and goodwill    
    
  Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, deferred financing costs, trademarks, trade names and customer relationships and contracts. Intangible assets are amortized as follows:    
    
                      Trademarks and trade names  
    10 years straight-line  
      Customer relationships and contracts   
    15 years straight-line  

Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related debt, which approximates the effective interest method. On adoption of ASU 2015-03 for the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (as discussed in Note 3), this cost is classified as an offset against our long-term debt and subordinated debt.      
    
  Property and equipment    
    
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation methods for property and equipment are as follows:    
    
                      Vessels 
    5 - 30 years straight-line 
      Leasehold improvements   
    7 - 11 years straight-line 
      Purchased software 
    3 years straight-line 
      Vehicles  
    20% declining-balance  
      Furniture and equipment   
    20% declining-balance  
      Computer equipment   
    45% declining-balance  
      Communication equipment   
    20% declining-balance  

Impairment of fixed assets   and finite-lived intangible assets 
    
  Fixed assets (e.g., property and equipment) and finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships and contracts) are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event that indicates the carrying value of such an asset or asset group (e.g., tugs and barges) might be no longer recoverable. Examples of such triggering events include, but are not limited to a significant disposal of a portion of such assets, an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset(s), a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business, and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business.    
    
  Once a triggering event has occurred, the recoverability test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset(s) for continued use or to hold the asset(s) for sale.  If the intent is to hold the asset(s) for continued use, the recoverability test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows excluding interest expense but including any proceeds from eventual disposition, against the carrying value of the asset(s) as an initial test.  If the carrying value of such asset(s) exceeds the undiscounted cash flow, the carrying amount of the asset(s) would be deemed to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the fixed or amortizing intangible asset and the carrying value of such asset(s). The Company generally determines fair value by using the discounted cash flow method. If the intent is to hold the asset(s) for sale and certain other criteria are met (i.e., the asset(s) can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an actively pursuing buyer), the impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the asset(s) to its fair value less costs to sell. To the extent that the carrying value is greater than the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. As of June 30, 2016, the Company determined that the smallest carrying capacity Canadian flag bulk carrier was unlikely to generate a sufficient long term return on capitalized expenses necessary to continue operating the vessel. As a result, the Company decided to retire this vessel. The Company has also determined that the carrying value of the vessel is greater than the fair value and hence impairment charges were recorded to write off the carrying value of the vessel. Other than this vessel, there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the three and six month period ended September 30, 2016, and there are no other assets held for sale except as discussed above as of September 30, 2016.

2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
       
  Evaluation of goodwill for impairment    
    
  The Company annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill residing in its reporting units, to determine whether impairment may exist. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires that goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a three-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment.  Only if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined, based on qualitative factors, to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then entities are required to perform the next two steps of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of fair value of the Company s two reporting units, which are the Company s Canadian and U.S. operations (excluding the parent), are determined using various valuation techniques with the primary techniques being a discounted cash flow analysis and peer analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the Company s forecast and long-term estimates.  Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the third step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the third step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The third step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the existing assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. As of March 31, 2016, the Company conducted the qualitative assessment and determined that the fair value of its two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and the remaining two-step impairment testing was therefore not necessary. The Company has determined that there were no adverse changes in the Company's markets or other triggering events that indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company's reporting units was less than the carrying value during the six month period ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Drydock costs 
    
  Drydock costs incurred during statutory Canadian and United States certification processes are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is generally sixty (60) months. Drydock costs include costs of work performed by third party shipyards and subcontractors and other direct expenses to complete the mandatory certification process.    
    
  Repairs and maintenance 
    
  The Company s vessels require repairs and maintenance each year to ensure the fleet is operating efficiently during the shipping season.  The majority of repairs and maintenance are completed in January, February, and March of each year when the vessels are not engaged in affreightment activities.  The Company expenses such routine repairs and maintenance costs as incurred.  Significant repairs to the Company s vessels, such as major engine overhauls and major hull steel repairs, are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the upgrade or asset repaired.

2. 
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
       
  Income taxes    
    
  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740    Income Taxes   , which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is recognized, if necessary, to measure tax benefits to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Income tax expense (or benefit) for an interim period is based on income taxes computed for ordinary income or loss and income taxes computed for items or events that are not part of ordinary income or loss. At the end of each interim period, the Company applies an estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year to the year-to-date ordinary income (or loss) at the end of the interim period.     
    
  The Company classifies interest expense related to income tax liabilities, when applicable, as part of the interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations rather than income tax expense.  To date, the Company has not incurred material interest expenses or penalties relating to assessed taxation amounts.    
    
  An examination by the U.S. taxing authorities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 was completed, with no adjustments warranted.  Lower Lakes Towing is currently under examination by the Canadian taxing authority for the tax years 2014 and 2015.   The Company's primary U.S. state income tax jurisdictions are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Jersey and New York and its only international jurisdictions are Canada and its province of Ontario. The following table summarizes the open fiscal tax years for each major jurisdiction:    

Foreign currency translation 
    
  The Company uses the U.S. Dollar as its reporting currency.  The functional currency of the Company's Canadian subsidiaries is the Canadian Dollar.  The functional currency of the Company s U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the respective month.  Components of stockholders  equity are translated at historical exchange rates.  Exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, except for financial assets and liabilities designated in foreign currency, which are reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 

Advertising costs 
    
  The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. These costs are included in general and administrative expenses and were insignificant during the periods presented.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
    
  Use of estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the assumptions used in determining the useful lives of long-lived assets, the assumptions used in determining whether assets are impaired, the assumptions used in determining the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets and the assumptions used in stock-based compensation awards. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
             
  Stock-based compensation  
    
  The Company recognizes compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified, repurchased or cancelled based on fair value at the date of grant.  
    
  Financial instruments 
    
  The Company accounts for its foreign currency hedge contracts on its subordinated debt utilizing ASC 815    Derivatives and Hedging    ("ASC 815"). All changes in the fair value of the contracts are recorded in earnings and the fair value of settlement costs to terminate the contract is included in current assets or current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Disclosure requirements of ASC 815 are presented in Note 22. 
    
  Fair value of financial instruments 
    
  ASC 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    ("ASC 820") defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the inputs to be used to estimate fair value. The three levels of inputs used are as follows: 
    
  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
    
  The disclosure requirements of ASC 820 related to the Company s financial assets and liabilities are presented in Note 22.

    RECENTLY ISSUED PRONOUNCEMENTS  
       
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers    
       
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (the "FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 would have been effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of the new standard by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2014-09,   as subsequently amended, s  hall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date.    In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting   ("ASU 2016-11"). ASU 2016-11 rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services. In addition, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 (Topic 606)   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 )  ,   which clarifies the principal-versus-agent guidance in Topic 606 and requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. In April 2016, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 (Topic 606)   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ), which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-12 (Topic 606)   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ), which amends the revenue guidance to clarify measurement and presentation as well as to include some practical expedients and policy elections. There are two transition methods available under the new standard, either cumulative effect or retrospective. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09.  The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, that adopting these new accounting standards will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    
     Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). ASU 2014-15 also provides guidance related to the required disclosures as a result of management's evaluation.    
    
  The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, this  ASU 2014-15 will have when adopted.

3.      RECENTLY ISSUED PRONOUNCEMENTS (continued) 
       
  Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,     Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs     ("ASU 2015-03"). This guidance requires that the debt issuance costs related to a recognized term debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt dis  count. This amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and has been applied retrospectively to each period presented. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 for the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  As a result of the adoption of this pronouncement, our unamortized deferred financing costs at March 31, 2016 of   $4,903   were reclassified from intangible assets to an offset against our long-term debt and subordinated debt. The effect of the adoption did not result in a change to equity or net income (See Notes 10, 13 and 14).  
    Leases (Topic 842) 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 revises the existing guidance related to leases by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, as well as additional disclosure regarding leasing arrangements. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
       
  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09")  .   ASU 2016-09 simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequences, classification of awards, the option to recognize stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures as they occur, and the classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within each reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  
       
  Statement of Cash Flow: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 (Topic 230)   Statement of Cash Flow: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The pronouncement provides clarification guidance on certain cash flow presentation issues such as debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs and contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. This pronouncement is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ("ASU No. 2016-16").  ASU No. 2016-16 provides guidance on recognition of current income tax consequences for intra-entity asset transfers (other than inventory) at the time of transfer.  This represents a change from current GAAP, where the consolidated tax consequences of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred from the time of transfer to a future period.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption at the beginning of an annual period is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that ASU No. 2016-16 will have on the financial statements and disclosures.

    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET 
       
  Trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance was   $114   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $116   as of   March 31, 2016  .  The Company manages and evaluates the collectability of its trade receivables as follows: management reviews aged accounts receivable listings and contact is made with customers that have extended beyond agreed upon credit terms. Senior management and operations are notified so that when they are contacted by such customers for a future delivery, they can request that the customer pays any past due amounts before any future cargo is booked for shipment. Customer credit risk is also managed by reviewing the history of payments by the customer, the size and credit quality of the customer, the period of time remaining within the shipping season and demand for future cargos.

5.  PREPAID     EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS 
    
  Prepaid expenses and other current assets are comprised of the following: 

6. 
    INCOME TAXES 

The Company's effective tax rate for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was a deferred tax benefit of   46.3%   compared to a deferred tax benefit of   41.3%   for the six month period ended September 30, 2015. The change in effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in permanent differences and discrete items compared to the prior year comparative period.  
    
  For state tax purposes, the Company is in a small net deferred tax liability position before the consideration of the valuation allowance at September 30, 2016.  After the consideration of the reversing patterns of these liabilities on a separate jurisdiction basis, it is expected that a portion of these liabilities will reverse within the period of time available for existing deferred tax assets including the net operating loss carryforward.  The Company recorded a small valuation allowance against the U.S. state net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016.   
    
  The effective tax rate for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the implementation of the valuation allowance related to the net U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets, which are primarily net operating losses. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016. The Company did not incur any income tax related interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions during each of the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET 
       
  Property and equipment, net are comprised of the following: 

Property and equipment as of September 30, 2016 includes capitalized interest during the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 of   $Nil   (  $1,161   for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016).  
    
  As of June 30, 2016, the Company determined that its smallest carrying capacity Canadian flag bulk carrier was unlikely to generate a sufficient long-term return on capitalized expenses necessary to continue operating the vessel. As a result, the Company decided to retire this vessel as of June 30, 2016. The Company has also determined that the carrying value of the vessel is greater than the fair value and hence impairment charges of   $1,872   including write-off of unamortized drydock costs were recorded during the three month period ended June 30, 2016. The vessel did not sail during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The operating loss of the vessel, included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was   $Nil   versus operating profit of   $444   for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.

    INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET AND GOODWILL 
       
  Intangibles, net are comprised of the following: 

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03     "  Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs"     (as discussed in Note 3)  , deferred financing costs at March 31, 2016 were reclassified from intangible assets to an offset against long-term debt and subordinated debt. 
    
  Intangible asset amortization over the next   five   years is estimated as follows:

On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Memorandum of Agreement with Uni-Tankers M/T  Lalandia Swan  ApS, pursuant to which Lower Lakes Towing purchased the Lalandia Swan for a purchase price of   $7,000  . Lower Lakes Towing subsequently transferred the title of such vessel to Lower Lakes (17). This acquisition was funded with borrowings under the subordinated debt described in Note 14. The vessel was converted to a self-unloading vessel. The Lalandia Swan was renamed the M.V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed into service in November 2015.

  On March 27, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement ( as amended from time to time, the  First Lien Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as agent and lender, and certain other lenders party thereto. Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, and Black Creek are borrowers (the  Borrowers ) under the First Lien Credit Agreement.  Black Creek, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, Black Creek Holdings, Rand LL Holdings and Rand Finance, each of which is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company itself are guarantors of all United States and Canadian obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement (collectively, the  U.S. Guarantors ).

In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. On February 9, 2016, the Company and the lenders entered into an Amendment No. 1 and Waiver Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders.

  Obligations under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured by the first-priority liens and security interests in substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors, including a pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of the borrowers and the guarantors. The indebtedness of each domestic borrower under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by each other domestic borrower and by the guarantors which are domestic subsidiaries, and such guaranty is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of each borrower and each guarantor. Each domestic borrower also guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower and each Canadian guarantor guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower. Under the Second Lien Credit Agreement and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), the borrowers will be required to make mandatory prepayments of principal on term loan borrowings (i) in the event of certain dispositions of assets and insurance proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions), in an amount equal to   100%   of the net proceeds received by the borrowers therefrom, and (ii) in an amount equal to   100%   of the net proceeds to a borrower from any issuance of a borrower s debt or equity securities (all subject to certain exceptions).  
    
  The Second Lien Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including those limiting the guarantors, the borrowers, and their subsidiaries  ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the nature of their businesses, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments or pay dividends. In addition, the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. Failure of the borrowers or the guarantors to comply with any of these covenants or financial ratios could result in the loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement being accelerated. The obligations of the borrowers and the liens of the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the terms of an Intercreditor Agreement, which is further described below under the heading  Intercreditor Agreement . 
    
  On April 11, 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment (the  First Amendment ) to the Second Lien Credit Agreement.  The First Amendment extended the due date of certain post-closing deliverables.  In connection with the First Lien Credit Agreement described above, on March 27, 2015 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to the Second Lien Credit Agreement.  The Second Amendment conformed certain provisions of the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement to the First Lien Credit Agreement, reduced the uncommitted incremental facility to   $22,500  , and also amended certain other covenants and terms thereof. On February 9, 2016, Rand and the lenders entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver Under Term Loan Credit Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders.  
  As of June 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the Second Lien Credit Agreement (formal notice of such noncompliance was received by the Company on August 24, 2016, but was later rescinded after a waiver from the lenders was obtained).  On August 26, 2016, the parties to the Second Lien Credit Agreement entered into a Fourth Amendment and Waiver To Term Loan Credit Agreement (the  Second Lien Waiver ) pursuant to which the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement waived the breach of certain financial and other covenants by the Company, including the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio covenants therein, in each case calculated as of June 30, 2016. The Second Lien Waiver also modifies the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio covenants, further limits the exceptions to the Restricted Payments (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) allowed to be made by the Company, incorporates new restrictions on certain Company activities, provides for (1) additional fees, (2) additional pay-in-kind interest under certain circumstances, and (3) certain additional Events of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), including the non-payment of certain current and potential future fees that will only become due and payable if certain milestones are not met related to the Company's progress towards a refinancing of the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Second Lien Credit Agreement as amended.

  Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders have agreed to subordinate the obligations of the Credit Parties to them to the repayment of the obligations of the Credit Parties to the First Lien Lenders and have further agreed to subordinate their liens on the assets of the Credit Parties to the liens granted in favor of the First Lien Lenders.  Absent the occurrence of an Event of Default under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders are permitted to receive regularly scheduled principal and interest payments under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 

The Company did not have any leases which met the criteria of a capital lease as of   September 30, 2016  . Leases which do not qualify as capital leases are classified as operating leases.

  (U.S. Dollars 000 s except for Shares and Per Share data)  

The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings which management expects to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity, nor is the Company aware of any proceedings that are pending or threatened which management believes may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, the Company may be subject to ordinary routine litigation and claim incidental to the business involving principally commercial charter party disputes, and claims for alleged property damages, personal injuries and other matters. Those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  It is expected that larger claims would be covered by insurance, subject to customary deductibles, if they involve liabilities that may arise from collision, other marine casualty, damage to cargoes, oil pollution, death or personal injuries to crew. The Company evaluates the need for loss accruals under the requirements of ASC 450     Contingencies.    The Company records an estimated loss for any claim, lawsuit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, then the Company records the minimum amount in the range as the loss accrual. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. As of   September 30, 2016  , an accrual of   $255   (  $247   as of   March 31, 2016  ) was recorded for various claims.  Management believes that it has recorded adequate reserves and believes that it has adequate insurance coverage or has meritorious defenses for these claims, however the Company cannot assure that such reserves will be sufficient to cover all costs incurred, or that insurance will be available or sufficient, or that any defenses will be successful.

All options issued through   September 30, 2016   expire   ten   years from the date of grant. Stock option grant date fair values are determined at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, a closed-form fair value model based on exercise price and market prices at the date of grant and other assumptions. At each grant date the Company has estimated a dividend yield of   0%  .

Options outstanding (  341,752  ) at September 30, 2016 had a remaining weighted average contractual life of approximately four years and five months.   
    
  The Company recorded compensation expenses related to such stock options of   $7   for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and   $19   for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 and   $Nil   for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2015.

  Shares issued in lieu of cash compensation   - The Company experienced a decrease in customer demand at the beginning of the 2009 sailing season and in an effort to maximize the Company s liquidity, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors requested that   three   of the Company s executive officers and all of its outside directors receive common stock as compensation in lieu of cash until the Company had better visibility about its outlook. As of November 16, 2009, the Company issued   158,325   shares to such officers and all of its outside directors at the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The shares were issued under the LTIP and vested immediately. Beginning the third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, such executives' and outside directors  compensation reverted back to cash.  
    
  On September 16, 2010, the Company issued   15,153   shares to a key executive for payment of the fiscal year 2010 bonus at the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The shares were issued under the LTIP and vested immediately. On February 15, 2013, the Company issued   94,993   shares to eligible Canadian and U.S. employees for a bonus. On December 8, 2015, the Company issued   61,622   shares to eligible Canadian and U.S. employees for incentive compensation at the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. On April 1, 2016, the Company issued   1,000   shares to an executive as a signing bonus. Grant date fair market value for all these awards is the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The shares were issued under the LTIP and vested immediately.   
    
  Restricted Stock Units   - On June 27, 2014, the Company issued   30,050   Restricted Stock Units ( RSU ) to eligible U.S. and Canadian employees under the LTIP. Each RSU represents one share of the Company's common stock. The grant date fair value of each RSU was   $5.99  , which represents the average of the high and low sale prices of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. One-third of the RSUs vest on March 31st of each year, beginning on March 31, 2015. RSUs are not entitled to dividends or voting rights, if any, until the underlying shares of common stock are delivered. The total compensation cost of this grant is   $204  , net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of the RSU awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company recorded expense of   $15   for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and   $30   for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  On the first vesting date of March 31, 2015,   10,559   shares vested. On the second vesting date of March 31, 2016,   8,905   shares vested.

22.        FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Fair value of financial instruments 
    
  Financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, senior and subordinated debts, a deferred payment liability and accrued liabilities.  The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate book values because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.  The estimated fair value of senior and subordinated debt approximates the carrying value as the debt bears interest at variable interest rates, which are based on rates for similar debt with similar credit rates in the open market.  The deferred payment liabilities are valued based on the interest rate of similar debt in the open market. 
    
  Commencing August 2014, the Company entered into rolling foreign currency hedge contracts of various amounts to mitigate currency fluctuation risk on its subordinated U.S. dollar denominated debt owed by Lower Lakes Towing. 
  Fair value guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value.  This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.  A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  The following table provides the fair value of the foreign currency hedge contracts measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016: 

The foreign currency hedge contracts are measured at fair value using available rates on the similar instruments and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method as if they were terminated at the day of valuation. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  The Company recorded a payable of   $437   as of September 30, 2016 for the foreign currency hedge contract on the Company s U.S. dollar denominated subordinated debt owed by Lower Lakes Towing. For the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the fair value adjustments of the foreign currency hedge contract resulted in a gain of   $1,185   (gain of   $2,215   for the three month period ended September 30, 2015) and a gain of   $2,050   for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 (gain of   $1,484   for the six month period ended  September 30, 2015). These gains are included in the Company s earnings, and the fair value of settlement costs to terminate the contract is included in current liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

   The following table sets forth the fair value of the foreign currency hedge instruments as of the dates set forth below: 

The Company has not designated this contract as a hedging instrument. The changes in fair value of the foreign currency hedge contracts are recorded in earnings as follows: 

Foreign exchange risk 
    
  Foreign currency exchange risk to the Company results primarily from changes in exchange rates between the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and the Canadian dollar.  As discussed above, in August 2014, the Company commenced entering into rolling foreign currency hedge contracts to mitigate currency fluctuation risk on its U.S. dollar denominated subordinated debt owed by Lower Lakes Towing. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange as a significant portion of revenue and operating expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars. 
    
  Interest rate risk 
    
  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of its banking facilities and senior debt bearing variable interest rates. 
    
  In December 2012, the Company entered into   two   interest rate cap contracts covering   50%   of its then outstanding term debt on the date of such contracts at a cap of three month LIBOR at   2.5%   on its U.S. term debt borrowings and a cap of three month BA rates at   3.0%   on its Canadian term debt borrowings. The notional amount on each of these instruments decreased with each scheduled principal payment of the term loan, notwithstanding the termination of such agreement. The interest rate cap contracts terminated on December 1, 2015 and were not renewed. 
    
  Credit risk 
    
  Accounts receivable credit risk is mitigated by the diversification of the Company s customers among industries and the short shipping season.

  Liquidity risk 
    
  Tightened credit in financial markets or an economic downturn in certain of our markets may adversely affect the ability of the Company s customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant operations and purchases and to perform their obligations under agreements with the Company.  A tightening of credit could (i) result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, existing business, (ii) limit new business, (iii) negatively impact the Company s ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis and (iv) affect the eligible receivables that are collateral for the Company s lines of credit.  Excluding vessel acquisitions or major vessel conversion contracts, the Company makes seasonal net incremental borrowings under its Credit Agreement during the first quarter of each fiscal year to fund working capital needed to commence the sailing season. Such borrowings are then reduced during the second half of each fiscal year. 
   
           23. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS")

  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Rand, we, us and the Company include Rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and references to the business of Lower Lakes mean the combined business of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek Shipping Company, Inc. ("Black Creek"). 
  On December 27, 2012, Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. ("Lower Lakes Ship Repair"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes Ship Repair provides ship repair services exclusively to the Company.  On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. ("Lower Lakes (17)"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes (17) owns the Manitoulin, a vessel placed in service in November 2015. 
  Our shipping business is operated in Canada by Lower Lakes Towing and in the United States by Lower Lakes Transportation.  Lower Lakes Towing was organized in March 1994 under the laws of Canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the Great Lakes. Lower Lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full-service shipping company with a combined fleet of fifteen cargo-carrying vessels operating in Canada and the United States.  We have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the Great Lakes and a leading service provider in the River Class market segment. We transport construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction, electric utility, food and integrated steel industries. 
  We believe that Lower Lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region.  Lower Lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian-flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in Canada, respectively. 
  Lower Lakes' fleet consists of six self-unloading bulk carriers and three conventional bulk carriers in Canada (excluding a retired vessel) and six self-unloading bulk carriers in the U.S., including three articulated tug and barge units. Lower Lakes Towing owns ten Canadian vessels, including a retired vessel. Lower Lakes Transportation time charters the six U.S. vessels, including the three tug and barge units, from Grand River. With the exception of two of the articulated tug and barge units (which Grand River bareboat charters from Black Creek), Grand River owns the vessels that it time charters to Lower Lakes Transportation.

Vessel Acquisitions and Retirement 
    
  On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia Swan from Uni-Tankers M/T ("Lalandia Swan") for a purchase price of $7.0 million.  The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel.   After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015. 
  As of June 30, 2016, we determined that our smallest carrying capacity Canadian flag bulk carrier was unlikely to generate a sufficient long term return on capital given the operating and capital expenses necessary to maintain the vessel. As a result, we retired this vessel as of June 30, 2016. 
  Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  Our discussion of our Results of Operations contains references to certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including, when applicable, (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease, and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles. Such measures are used internally when evaluating our operating performance and, we believe, allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that such measures, when viewed with the Company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period comparisons. Additionally, management believes that (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange,  restructuring charges  and impairment charges on retired asset and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings. However, the Company's definition of such measures may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.  Instead, such performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided below.   
  Our discussion of our Results of Operations also contains references to constant currency amounts.  The constant currency information presented herein is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue from our Canadian operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue.  Consequently, our revenue has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  For example, if the Canadian dollar weakens, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted.  These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results.  As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.  We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our business.  The Company's definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Results of Operations for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three month period ended   September 30, 2015    
  Selected Financial and Operating Information  

40 

The following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and certain expenses during the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  :    
 *Operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles and (gain) loss on foreign exchange.  
  Total revenue during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $39.2 million  , a decrease of   24.4%  , compared to   $51.9 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease was primarily attributable to the Company's decision to operate two less vessels based on reduced demand for coal and aggregates in the Great Lakes region and the loss of revenue associated with a time charter contract that the counter party bought out in the last quarter of fiscal year 2016, and reduction in fuel surcharges. These factors combined resulted in a 93 day decrease in Sailing Days (which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing). These decreases were partially offset by contractual price increases and higher water levels. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue decreased   24.6%  , or   $12.8 million  , during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Freight and other related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels decreased   $6.3 million  , or   14.4%  , to   $37.5 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $43.8 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decline was primarily a result of a 93 days decrease in Sailing Days due to the Company s decision to operate two less vessels based on reduced demand. On a constant currency basis, freight and other related revenue decreased   14.5%  , or   $6.4 million  , during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    According to the Lake Carriers' Association, during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, U.S.-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes experienced a 6.8% decrease in overall customer shipments for the commodities that we carry compared to the 2016 sailing season. During the same time period, U.S.-flagged vessels experienced a 18.8% decrease of coal tonnage carried and a 10.23% decrease of aggregates tonnage carried. These commodities account for a significant share of the dry bulk commodities that are transported on the Great Lakes. 
  Total tons hauled during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 14.9% compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015, which included tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment. Our tonnage carried on vessels that we operated during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased 10.7% compared to the three  
  
   41 

month period ended September 30, 2015.  During the three month period ended September 30, 2016 our tonnage in construction aggregates decreased 13.8% compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Our coal tonnage decreased 28.3% compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015 due to weaker demand. Salt tonnage decreased by 24.1% due to below average precipitation in the Great Lakes region during the past winter. Total iron ore tons carried increased by 7.8% during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to the negative state of the steel industry. During the last month of the quarter, we have seen improved activities in iron ore tonnage.  
    
  We operated fourteen vessels (the  Operated Vessels ) during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, including one vessel recently placed to serve the grain market, compared to operating fifteen vessels during the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  We operated a  total of   1,185   Sailing Days in the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to   1,278   Sailing Days in the prior year. Management believes that each of our Operated Vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum of 92 Sailing Days in the second fiscal quarter, assuming average weather conditions,  and no major repairs, incidents or vessel layups. The Company s Operated Vessels sailed an average of approximately   90   Sailing Days, excluding the recently introduced vessel to serve increased demand in the grain market during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to an average of   85   Sailing Days during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . The higher utilization of our Operated Vessels signifies our disciplined  approach in a softer overall market. Our Operated Vessels operated for   97.8%   of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   92.6%   of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  We also measure "Delay Days", which we define as the lost time incurred by our vessels while in operation, and includes delays caused by inclement weather, dock delays, traffic congestion, vessel mechanical issues and other varied events. We experienced 73 Delay Days during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 68 Delay Days during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   Such Delay Days represent a lost time factor, calculated as Delay Days as a percentage of Sailing Days, of 6.2% during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 5.4% during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Freight and related revenue per Sailing Day decreased   $2,639  , or   7.7%  , to   $31,661   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $34,300   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This revenue decrease was primarily due to a change in the mix of cargos carried and an increase in the number of Delay Days partially offset by favorable trade patterns. On a constant currency basis, freight and related revenue per Sailing Day decreased 7.8% or   $2,687   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  We had no outside voyage charter revenue in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. We have transferred tonnage carried on outside vessel charter during the 2015 sailing season to the capacity added by our newest vessel, which was placed into service in November 2015. 
  Our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby changes in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers.   Fuel and other surcharges decreased   $3.8 million  , or   69.0%  , to   $1.7 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.6 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Fuel and other surcharges per Sailing Day decreased by   $2,900  , or   66.6%  , to   $1,453   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $4,353   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases were primarily attributable to reduced fuel prices during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . On a constant currency basis, fuel and other surcharges decreased   69.2%  , or   $3.8 million  , during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  Vessel operating expenses decreased   $8.0 million  , or   26.6%  , to   $22.0 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $30.0 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to reduced Sailing Days, reduced fuel prices, lower insurance costs and operating efficiencies as a result of cost efficiency initiatives undertaken during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . Vessel operating expenses per Sailing Day decreased   $4,909  , or   20.9%  , to   $18,589   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $23,498   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  On a constant currency basis, vessel operating expenses decreased   26.8%  , or   $8.0 million  , during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Repairs and maintenance expenses, which primarily consist of expensed winter work, increased   $43 thousand   to   $0.1 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to costs related to the two laid up vessels previously  
  
   42 

discussed. Repairs and maintenance expenses per Sailing Day increased   $39   to   $84   per Sailing Day during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $45 per Sailing Day during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, repairs and maintenance expenses increased   $41.0 thousand   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .    
  Our general and administrative expenses were   $3.9 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.1 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is attributable to one time fees and expenses related to increased costs associated with obtaining waivers from our lenders,  duplicative headcount costs associated with the streamlining  of certain functions, locations and the management structure to support the business. Excluding these one-time charges, compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly. Our general and administrative expenses equaled   10.3%   and   7.1%   of freight and related revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Depreciation expense was   $5.2 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $4.6 million   for the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase of   $0.6 million   was primarily attributable to winter 2016 capital expenditures and depreciation attributable to our newest vessel. 
  Amortization of drydock costs was   $0.8 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $0.9 million   during the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company amortized the deferred drydock costs of eleven vessels   during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to thirteen vessels during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. 
  Gain on foreign exchange during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million  , as compared to a loss of   $14 thousand   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . Gain or loss on foreign exchange primarily relates to a translation of $39.8 million USD denominated debt incurred and carried on the balance sheet of the Canadian subsidiary and  a foreign currency hedge related to the debt. 
    As a result of the items described above, operating income during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $7.6 million   compared to   $10.3 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles and (gain) loss on foreign exchange decreased   $2.8 million  , or   17.6%  , from   $16.1 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $13.3 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016  .   On a constant currency basis, operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles and (gain) loss on foreign exchange decreased   17.8%  , or   $2.9 million  , during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
   Interest expense, which is net of capitalized interest and includes   $0.9 million   of amortization of deferred financing costs, increased by   $1.3 million   or   44.4%   to   $4.3 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.0 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to accelerated  amortization of deferred financing costs related to second lien debt and slightly higher average debt balance compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015 related to borrowing for the new vessel and no interest capitalization for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. Cash interest expense during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   equaled   $3.4 million   compared to   $3.0 million   for the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our income  before income taxes was   $3.3 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an income of   $7.4 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our effective tax rate was 9.6% on pre-tax income of $3.3 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a tax benefit of  61.3% on pre-tax income of $7.4 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Our provision for income tax expense was $0.3 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $4.5 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in income tax expense was due to a higher consolidated tax rate during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the continued existence of  the valuation allowance related to the net U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets, which are primarily net operating losses. 
  
   43 

Our net income before preferred stock dividends was   $3.0 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net income before preferred stock dividends of   $11.9 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We accrued   $0.4 million   for dividends on our preferred stock during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.3 million   for the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is attributable to a 1% increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends, partially offset by the conversion of a small number of preferred shares to common shares during March 2016.  
  Our income applicable to common stockholders was income of   $2.6 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income of   $11.5 million   during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The Canadian dollar (CDN) strengthened by   0.3%   compared to the U.S. dollar (USD) during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  , averaging approximately   $0.766   USD per CDN during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately   $0.764   USD per CDN during the   three month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company's balance sheet translation rate increased from $0.749 USD per CDN at   September 30, 2015   to $0.762 USD per CDN at   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company operated an average of five vessels in the U.S. and eight vessels in Canada, including a fourteenth vessel recently placed to serve the grain market.  The percentage of our total freight and other revenue, fuel and other surcharge revenue, vessel operating expenses, repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country.  Approximately one third of our general and administrative costs are incurred in Canada. Approximately 47% of our interest expense is incurred in Canada, reflecting the approximate percentage of total debt. All of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the U.S.

Results of Operations for the six month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the six month period ended   September 30, 2015    
  Selected Financial and Operating Information    

45 

The following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and certain expenses during the six month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the six month period ended   September 30, 2015  :    

  *Operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, restructuring charges and impairment charges on retired asset. 
  Total revenue during the six month ended September 30, 2016 was   $73.1 million  , a decrease of   24.5%  , compared to   $96.8 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease was primarily attributable to the Company's decision to operate two less vessels based on reduced demand for coal, salt and aggregates in the Great Lakes region and the loss of  revenue  
  
   46 

associated with a time charter contract that the counter party bought out in the last quarter of fiscal year 2016, a weaker Canadian dollar, and reduction in fuel surcharges.These factors combined resulted in a   352   day decrease in Sailing Days (which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing). These were partially offset by contractual price increases and higher water levels. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue decreased   23.6%  , or   $22.8 million  , during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Freight and other related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels decreased   $12.2 million  , or   14.7%  , to   $70.6 million   during the six month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $82.8 million   during the   six month period   ended    September 30, 2015  . The decline was primarily a result of a   352   day decrease in Sailing Days due to the Company s decision to operate two less vessels based on reduced demand and a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and other related revenue decreased   13.7%  , or   $12.2 million  , during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    According to the Lake Carriers' Association, during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016, U.S.-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes experienced a 5.1% decrease in overall customer shipments for the commodities that we carry compared to the 2016 sailing season. During the same time period, U.S.-flagged vessels experienced a 23.3% decrease of coal tonnage carried and a 7.0% decrease of aggregates tonnage carried. These commodities account for a significant share of the dry bulk commodities that are transported on the Great Lakes. 
  Our tonnage carried on vessels that we operated during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 decreased 11.9% compared to the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015.  During the   six month period    ended September 30, 2016 our tonnage in construction aggregates decreased 7.4% compared to the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015 due to weaker demand. Our coal tonnage decreased 40.0% compared to the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015 due to weaker demand. Salt tonnage decreased by 19.0% due to below average precipitation in the Great Lakes region during the past winter.  Total iron ore tons carried decreased by 8.9% during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 compared to the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015 due to the negative state of the steel industry.  
    
  We introduced our sixteenth vessel into service on November 22, 2015 and operated fourteen vessels (the  Operated Vessels ) during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , including a vessel recently placed in the grain business, compared to operating fifteen vessels during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015.  We operated a  total of   2,154   Sailing Days in the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016, compared to   2,506   Sailing Days in the prior year period. Management believes that each of our Operated Vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum of 183 Sailing Days in the first two quarters, assuming average weather conditions, no major repairs, incidents or vessel layups. The Company s Operated Vessels sailed an average of approximately   164   Sailing Days during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , excluding the recently introduced vessel to serve increased demand in the grain market compared to an average of   167   Sailing Days during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  , due to weak demand at the  start of the 2016 sailing season. Our Operated Vessels operated for   89.8%   of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   92.6%   of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  We also measure "Delay Days", which we define as the lost time incurred by our vessels while in operation, and includes delays caused by inclement weather, dock delays, traffic congestion, vessel mechanical issues and other varied events. We experienced 134 Delay Days during the   six month period    ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 177 Delay Days during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   Such Delay Days represent a lost time factor, calculated as Delay Days as a percentage of Sailing Days, of 6.2% during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 7.1% during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Freight and related revenue per Sailing Day decreased to   $32,787    per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $33,042   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This revenue decrease was primarily due to a change in the mix of cargos carried and a weaker Canadian dollar, offset by reduced Delay Days. On a constant currency basis, freight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased   0.4%   or   $133   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  We had no outside voyage charter revenue in the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.4 million during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. We have transferred tonnage carried on outside vessel charter during the 2015 sailing season to our newest vessel, which was placed into service in November 2015.

Our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby changes in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers.   Fuel and other surcharges decreased   $7.1 million  , or   74.5%  , to   $2.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.5 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Fuel and other surcharges per Sailing Day decreased by   $2,672  , or   70.3%  , to   $1,130   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3,802   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases were primarily attributable to reduced fuel prices and a weaker Canadian dollar during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . On a constant currency basis, fuel and other surcharges decreased   73.9%   or   $7.0 million  , during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  Vessel operating expenses decreased   $15.7 million  , or   27.8%  , to   $40.9 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $56.6 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduced Sailing Days, reduced fuel prices and operating efficiencies as a result of cost efficiency initiatives undertaken during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . Vessel operating expenses per Sailing Day decreased   $3,606  , or   16.0%  , to   $18,974   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $22,580   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  On a constant currency basis, vessel operating expenses decreased   26.9%  , or   $15.2 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Repairs and maintenance expenses, which primarily consist of expensed winter work, increased   $0.2 million   to   $1.1 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the late sailing of some of our vessels at the beginning of  the 2016 sailing season, offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. Repairs and maintenance expenses per Sailing Day increased   $146   to   $504   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $358   per Sailing Day during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. On a constant currency basis, repairs and maintenance expenses increased   $0.2 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .    
  Our general and administrative expenses were   $7.7 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $6.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . Approximately $0.6 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses relates to a one time third party strategic review to evaluate a number of capital allocation and cost reduction opportunities and to one time fees and expenses related to increased costs associated with obtaining waivers from our lenders. The remainder of the increase is attributable to duplicative headcount costs associated with the streamlining  of certain functions, locations and the management structure to support the business. Excluding these one-time charges, compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly, but were offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. Our general and administrative expenses equaled   10.9%   and   7.7%   of freight and related revenue for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  Depreciation expense was   $10.5 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $9.3 million   for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase of   $1.2 million   was primarily attributable to winter 2016 capital expenditures and depreciation attributable to our newest vessel offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. 
  Amortization of drydock costs was   $1.6 million   during the six month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $1.8 million   for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company amortized the deferred drydock costs of eleven vessels   during the six month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to thirteen vessels during the six month period ended September 30, 2015. 
  Gain on foreign exchange during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 million  , as compared to a loss of   $0.3 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . Gain or loss on foreign exchange primarily relates to a translation of $39.8 million USD denominated debt incurred  and carried on the balance sheet of the Canadian subsidiary and  a foreign currency hedge related to the debt. 
  In connection with cost-reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, which primarily include the streamlining of certain functions, locations and the management structure to support the business, and implementing the necessary system changes to support these initiatives, we recorded expenses of $2,375 as restructuring costs. We anticipate that this initiative will be completed in a phased manner by the third quarter of the current fiscal year. We expect to realize the benefits of our restructuring costs through lower costs and increased operating efficiencies in future periods. Approximately 63% of the restructuring charge relates to contractual severance payments to our former Executive Vice Chairman and President of our subsidiaries, Lower Lakes Towing and Grand River Navigation.

As of  June 30, 2016, we determined that our smallest carrying capacity Canadian flag bulk carrier was unlikely to generate a sufficient long term return on capital given the operating and capitalized expenses necessary to continue operating the vessel. As a result, we retired this vessel as of June 30, 2016. We also determined that the carrying value of the vessel is greater than the fair value based on the price in the international market of similar vessels and scrap prices and hence we recorded impairment charges of $1,872 including write-off of unamortized drydock costs. The operating loss of the vessel, included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 was $107 versus operating profit of $589 for   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. 
    As a result of the items described above, operating income during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.2 million   compared to   $16.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, restructuring charges  and impairment charges on retired assets decreased   $5.0 million  , or   17.7%  , to   $23.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $28.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .   On a constant currency basis, operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, restructuring charges and impairment charges on retired asset decreased   16.6%  , or   $4.7 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
   Interest expense, which is net of capitalized interest and includes   $1.2 million   of amortization of deferred financing costs, increased by   $1.9 million   or   32.0%   to   $7.9 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $6.0 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to accelerated  amortization of deferred financing costs related to second lien debt, a higher average debt balance compared to the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 related to borrowing for the new vessel and no interest capitalization for the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a a weaker Canadian dollar. Cash interest expense during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   equaled   $6.7 million   compared to   $6.1 million    for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our income before income taxes was   $0.3 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an income of   $10.5 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our effective tax rate was a benefit of 46.3% on pre-tax income of  $0.3 million during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of 41.3% on pre-tax income of $10.5 million during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. None of our U.S. federal income tax expense is payable in cash due to our net operating loss carry-forwards ("NOL"). Our income tax provision was a benefit of $0.1 million during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $4.3 million during the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income tax benefit was due to lower net loss before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the implementation of the valuation allowance related to the net U.S. Federal and state deferred tax assets, which are primarily NOLs. 
  Our net income before preferred stock dividends was   $0.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net income before preferred stock dividends of   $14.8 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We accrued   $0.8 million   for dividends on our preferred stock during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.6 million   for the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase is attributable to a 1% increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends, partially offset by the conversion of a small number of preferred shares to common shares during March 2016.  
  Our income applicable to common stockholders was a loss of    $0.4 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income of   $14.1 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The Canadian dollar (CDN) weakened by   2.3%   compared to the U.S. dollar (USD) during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  , averaging approximately   $0.771   USD per CDN during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to approximately   $0.789   USD per CDN during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company's balance sheet translation rate decreased from $0.749 USD per CDN at   September 30, 2015   to $0.762 USD per CDN at   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company operated an average of five vessels in the U.S. and eight vessels in Canada, including a fourteenth vessel recently placed to serve the grain market.  The percentage of our total freight  
  
   49 

and other revenue, fuel and other surcharge revenue, vessel operating expenses, repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country.  Approximately one third of our general and administrative costs are incurred in Canada. Approximately 47% of our interest expense is incurred in Canada, reflecting the approximate percentage of total debt. All of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the U.S.  
  Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
  During each of the   six month period  s ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs. However, our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges.  In addition, there was volatility in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar during the   six month period  s ended    September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , which impacted the average of monthly translation rates for total revenue and costs to U.S. dollars by a decrease of approximately   2.3%   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, the proceeds of our credit facilities and proceeds from sales of our common stock. In March 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured debt as discussed below.  Our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions, capital expenditures, drydock expenditures, operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facilities.  Information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (categorized by operating, investing and financing activities), which is included in our consolidated financial statements for each of the   six month period  s ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  We believe cash generated from our operations and the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt services requirements over the next twelve months. However, if the Company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the Company's customers materially delay their receivable payments, the Company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity.  The Company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls, and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances. 
  On September 20, 2016, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") providing notification that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We have an initial grace period until March 20, 2017 to regain compliance, but if we fail to regain compliance, our common stock could be delisted and this would likely further depress the value of our common stock and negatively impact our liquidity.  
       
  Net cash provided by operating activities during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.9 million  , a decrease of    $7.3 million  , from   $12.2 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decreased use of cash was primarily attributable to reduced cash earnings for the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 and a higher cash outflow on drydock costs paid in the   six month period   ended September 30, 2016 
    
  The Company did not incur any significant bad-debt write-offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during either of the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015.  
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased by   $29.0 million   to   $9.1 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   from net cash used of    $38.1 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to  higher capital expenditures on the conversion of our newest vessel to a self-unloading vessel for the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015. This new vessel was placed into service in November 2015. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities decreased   $20.2 million   to   $4.4 million   provided during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $24.6 million   during the   six month period   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is attributable to higher borrowings under our senior credit facilities in the   six month period   ended September 30, 2015, related to the new vessel placed in service in November 2016. 
    Debt 
    
    We had total debt outstanding of   $193.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   which is comprised of amounts outstanding under our First Lien Credit Agreement (defined below) of   $117.1 million   and our Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below) of  
  
   50 

$76.0 million   both presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
    
  First Lien Credit Agreement 
    
    On March 27, 2015, Rand and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended on from time to time, the  First Lien Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as agent and lender, and certain other lenders party thereto.  Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, and Black Creek are borrowers (the  Borrowers ) under the First Lien Credit Agreement. Black Creek, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, Black Creek Holdings, Rand LL Holdings Corp. and Rand Finance Corp., each of which is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Rand and Rand itself are guarantors of all United States and Canadian obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement (collectively, the  U.S. Guarantors ). Lower Lakes Towing (17) and Lower Lakes Ship Repair are guarantors of all Canadian obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement and are direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Rand (collectively, the  Canadian Guarantors  and together with the U.S. Guarantors, the  Guarantors ). The proceeds of the First Lien Credit Agreement were used to extinguish certain then existing indebtedness and to provide working capital financing and funds for other general corporate and permitted purposes. 
       
  The obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers and the Guarantors party to the agreement, including a pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of the Borrowers and the Guarantors.  The security interests are evidenced by pledge, security and guaranty agreements and other related agreements, including certain fleet mortgages.  
    
  The credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities") under First Lien Credit Agreement consist of: 
             
    A revolving credit facility under which Lower Lakes Towing may borrow up to US $80 million (CDN or USD currency to be selected by Lower Lakes Towing) with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the "Canadian Revolving Facility"); 
                
    A revolving credit facility under which Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek may borrow up to USD $90 million with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the "U.S. Revolving Facility"); 
                
    A swing line facility under which Lower Lakes Towing may borrow up to the lesser of CDN $8 million and the CDN maximum borrowing availability less the outstanding balance of the Canadian Revolving Facility, with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the "Canadian Swing Line Facility"); and 
                
    A swing line facility under which Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek may borrow up to USD $9 million, less the outstanding balance of the U.S. Revolving Facility, with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the "U.S. Swing Line Facility"). 
       
  Borrowings under the Credit Facilities will bear interest, in each case plus an applicable margin, as follows: 
             
    Canadian Revolving Facility  : if funded in Canadian Dollars, the BA Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement)or, at the borrower s option, the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) and if funded in U.S. Dollars, the Canadian Base Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) or, at the borrower s option, the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement); 
                
    U.S. Revolving Facility  : the U.S. Base Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) or, at the borrower s option, the LIBOR Rate; 
                
    Canadian Swing Line Facility  : the Canadian Prime Rate or, at the borrower s option, the Canadian Base Rate; and 
                
    U.S. Swing Line Facility  : the U.S. Base Rate. 
       
  The effective interest rates at September 30, 2016 were   3.64%   (  3.60%   at March 31, 2016) on the Canadian Revolving Facility and   3.48%   (  3.37%   at March 31, 2016) on the U.S. Revolving Facility. 
    
  The applicable margin to the BA Rate, Canadian Prime Rate, Canadian Base Rate, U.S. Base Rate and the LIBOR Rate is subject to specified changes depending on the Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement). The Borrowers will also pay a monthly commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.25% on the undrawn committed amount available under the Canadian Revolving Facility and the U.S. Revolving Facility (the  Revolving Facilities ), which rate shall increase to 0.375% in the event the undrawn committed amount is greater than or equal to 50% of the aggregate committed amount under the Revolving Facilities. 
    
  Any amounts outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement are due at maturity.  In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Borrowers will be required to make principal repayments on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales, debt issuances and equity offerings. No such transactions have occurred as of March 31, 2016.

The First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants, including those limiting the guarantors , the borrowers , and their subsidiaries  ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the nature of their businesses, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments or pay dividends.  In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. On February 9, 2016, Rand and the lenders entered into an Amendment No. 1 and Waiver Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders.  As of June 30, 2016, Rand was not in compliance with certain covenants in the First Lien Credit Agreement.  On August 26, 2016, the parties to the First Lien Credit Agreement entered into an Amendment No. 2 and Waiver Agreement (the  First Lien Waiver ) pursuant to which the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement waived the breach of certain financial and other covenants by the Company, including breach of the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA covenant therein, calculated as of June 30, 2016. The First Lien Waiver also modifies the Maximum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio covenants, further limits the exceptions to the Restricted Payments (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) allowed to be made by the Company, provides for additional fees, and incorporates new restrictions on certain Company activities. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was $118.8 million and Rand was  in compliance with the covenants set forth in the First Lien Credit Agreement as amended.  
    
  Second Lien Credit Agreement 
    
  On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing, Grand River and Black Creek, as borrowers, Rand LL Holdings, Rand Finance, Black Creek Holdings and Rand, as guarantors, Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, as agent and Lender, and certain other lenders, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (as amended on from time to time, the  Second Lien Credit Agreement ). The Second Lien Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) a U.S. Dollar denominated term loan facility under which Lower Lakes Towing is obligated to the lenders in the amount of $34.2 million (the "Second Lien CDN Term Loan"); (ii) a U.S. dollar denominated term loan facility under which Grand River and Black Creek are obligated to the lenders in the amount of $38.3 million  (the "Second Lien U.S. Term Loan"); and (iii) an uncommitted incremental term loan facility of up to $32.5 million as of March 27, 2015. 
    
    The outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien CDN Term Loan borrowings and the Second Lien U.S. Term Loan borrowings will be repayable upon their maturity on March 11, 2020. The Second Lien CDN Term Loan and Second Lien U.S. Term Loan bear an interest rate per annum at borrowers  option, equal to (i) LIBOR (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) plus 9.50% per annum, or (ii) the U.S. Base Rate (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), plus 8.50% per annum. 
    
  The effective interest rates at March 31, 2016 were 10.75% (10.75% at March 31, 2015) on each of the Second Lien CDN Term Loan and the Second Lien U.S. Term Loan.  
    
  Obligations under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured by the first-priority liens and security interests in substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors, including a pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of the borrowers and the guarantors.  The indebtedness of each domestic borrower under the Second Lien Credit Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by each other domestic borrower and by the guarantors which are domestic subsidiaries, and such guaranty is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of each borrower and each guarantor. Each domestic borrower also guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower and each Canadian guarantor guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower.  
    
  Under the Second Lien Credit Agreement and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), the borrowers will be required to make mandatory prepayments of principal on term loan borrowings (i) in the event of certain dispositions of assets and insurance proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions), in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds received by the borrowers therefrom, and (ii) in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds to a borrower from any issuance of a borrower s debt or equity securities (all subject to certain exceptions).  
    
  The Second Lien Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including those limiting the guarantors, the borrowers, and their subsidiaries  ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the nature of their businesses, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments or pay dividends. In addition, the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. Failure of the borrowers or the guarantors to comply with any of these covenants or financial ratios could result in the loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement being accelerated. The obligations of the borrowers and the liens of the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are subject to the terms of an Intercreditor Agreement, which is further described below under the heading  Intercreditor Agreement . 
    
  On April 11, 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Second Lien Credit Agreement.  The First Amendment extended the due date of certain post-closing deliverables. On March  
  
   52 

27, 2015 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to the Second Lien Credit Agreement.  The Second Amendment conformed certain provisions of the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement to the First Lien Credit Agreement, reduced the uncommitted incremental facility to   $22,500  , and also amended certain other covenants and terms thereof. On February 9, 2016, Rand and the lenders entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver Under Term Loan Credit Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders. As of  June 30, 2016, Rand was not in compliance with certain covenants in the Second Lien Credit Agreement (formal notice of such noncompliance was received by the Company on August 24, 2016 but was later rescinded). On August 26, 2016, the parties to the Second Lien Credit Agreement entered into a Fourth Amendment and Waiver To Term Loan Credit Agreement (the  Second Lien Waiver ) pursuant to which the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement waived the breach of certain financial and other covenants by the Company, including the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio covenants therein, in each case calculated as of June 30, 2016. The Second Lien Waiver also modifies the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio covenants, further limits the exceptions to the Restricted Payments (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) allowed to be made by the Company, incorporates new restrictions on certain Company activities, provides for (1) additional fees, (2) additional pay-in-kind interest under certain circumstances, and (3) certain additional Events of Default (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), including the non-payment of certain current and potential future fees that will only become due and payable if certain milestones are not met related to the Company's progress towards a refinancing of the Second Lien Credit Agreement. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement was $76 million and Rand was in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Second Lien Credit Agreement as amended. 
    
  The Second Lien Credit Agreement also contemplates a $5.6 million incremental loan that was required in connection with certain borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement towards the delivery of our new vessel at the end of 2015.  This incremental loan was made on September 28, 2015. 
    
    Intercreditor Agreement 
    
  In connection with the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit agreement described above, on March 27, 2015, Rand and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an Intercreditor Agreement (the "Intercreditor Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as the agent for the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement (the "First Lien Lenders") and Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, as the agent for the lenders under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (the "Second Lien Lenders").  Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders have agreed to subordinate our obligations to them to the repayment of our obligations to the First Lien Lenders and have further agreed to subordinate their liens on our assets to the liens granted in favor of the First Lien Lenders.  Absent the occurrence of an Event of Default under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders are permitted to receive regularly scheduled principal and interest payments under the Second Lien Credit Agreement.  
    
  Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends 
  The shares of the Company's series A convertible preferred stock rank senior to the Company's common stock with respect to liquidation and dividends; are entitled to receive a cash dividend at the annual rate of 7.75% (based on the $50 per share issue price), payable quarterly (subject to increases of 0.5% for each six month period in respect of which the dividend is not paid in cash, up to a maximum of 12%, subject to reversion to 7.75% upon payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends); are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at any time at the option of the series A preferred stockholder at a conversion price of $6.20 per share (based on the $50 per share issue price and subject to adjustment) or 8.065 shares of common stock for each series A preferred share (subject to adjustment); are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock (based on a conversion price of $6.20 per share, subject to adjustment) at the option of the Company if, after the third anniversary of the date of issuance thereof, the trading price of the Company's common stock for 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period equals or exceeds $8.50 per share (subject to adjustment); may be redeemed by the Company in connection with certain change of control or acquisition transactions; will vote on an as-converted basis with the Company's common stock; and have a separate vote over certain material transactions or changes involving the Company.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.7 million   of unpaid accrued dividends on its preferred stock compared to   $1.9 million   at   March 31, 2016  .   This increase is attributable to an increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends. As of   September 30, 2016  , the effective rate of preferred dividends was 9.25% as compared to 8.75% at   March 31, 2016  . 

53 

Investments in Capital Expenditures and Drydockings 
  We incurred $4.4 million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the three month period  ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $32.0 million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The higher capital expenditures for three month period ended September 30, 2015 was related to our new vessel that was placed into service in November 2015.  
  Vessel Acquisition and Retirement 
  On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia swan from Uni-Tankers M/T ("Lalandia Swan") for a purchase price of $7.0 million.  The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel.  After conversion  to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed  the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015. 
  As of June 30, 2016, we determined that our smallest carrying capacity Canadian flag bulk carrier was unlikely to generate a sufficient long term return on capital given the operating and capitalized expenses necessary to continue operating the vessel. As a result, we retired this vessel as of June 30, 2016.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  There are no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    Lack of Historical Operating Data for Acquired Vessels  
  From time to time, as opportunities arise and depending on the availability of financing, we may acquire additional secondhand drybulk carriers. Information regarding the Lack of Historical Operating Data for Acquired Vessels can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Rand's significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. For a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business, see "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above and "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
       
  As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures. 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
  Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
  We have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as well as other members of our management. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

55 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings. 
  The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for legal proceedings related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on present information, including our assessment of the merits of each particular matter, as well as our current reserves and insurance coverage, we do not expect that any known legal proceeding will in the foreseeable future have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of our operations or our cash flows.   

Item 1A.   Risk Factors. 
  The following risk factor should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (our  Annual Report ), including the risk factors identified in Part I-Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our Annual Report. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,  above. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
    
  Our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ. 
    
  On September 20, 2016, we were notified by NASDAQ that the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance. If at any time before the expiration of such 180-day period, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance. If we do not regain compliance prior to the expiration of such 180 day period, an additional 180 days may be granted to regain compliance so long as we meet the NASDAQ Capital Market initial listing criteria (except for the bid price requirement). 
    
  In the future, our common stock may fall below the NASDAQ listing requirements or we may not comply with other listing requirements, resulting in our common stock being delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we may list our common stock for trading over the counter. Delisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock. A determination could also then be made that our common stock is a  penny stock  which would require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading. This could have a long-term impact on our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock. 

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
       
  None. 

Item 3. 
    Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
       
  None. 

Item 4. 
    Mine Safety Disclosures.
