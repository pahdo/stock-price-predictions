Organization
and Principal Business Activity    

Nxt-ID, Inc. ( Nxt-ID  or the
 Company ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 8, 2012. NXT-ID is a security technology company
providing security for finance, assets and healthcare. The Company s innovative MobileBio  solution mitigates risks
associated with mobile computing, m-commerce and smart OS-enabled devices. With extensive experience in   biometric
identity verification,   security, privacy,   encryption and data protection, payments, miniaturization and sensor
technologies, the Company partners with industry leading companies to provide solutions for modern payment and the Internet
of Things applications. The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, LogicMark, LLC ( LogicMark ), manufactures and distributes
non-monitored and monitored personal emergency response systems sold through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs,
healthcare durable medical equipment dealers and distributors and monitored security dealers and distributors. 

3D-ID, LLC ( 3D-ID ) was organized
and registered in the State of Florida on February 14, 2011. 

The Company is an emerging growth company
engaged in the design, research and development, integration, analysis, modeling, system networking, sales and support
of intelligent surveillance, three-dimensional facial recognition and three-dimensional imaging devices and systems
primarily for identification and access control in the security industries. 

On June 25, 2012, Nxt-ID, a company having similar
ownership as 3D-ID, acquired 100% of the membership interests in 3D-ID (the  Acquisition ) in exchange for 20,000,000
shares of Nxt-ID common stock. Since this was a transaction between entities under common control, in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,  Business Combinations , Nxt-ID recognized the net assets of 3D-ID
at their carrying amounts in the accounts of Nxt-ID on the date that 3D-ID was organized. 

On July 25, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of LogicMark, pursuant to
an Interest Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, LogicMark and the holders of all of the membership interests of
LogicMark (the  LogicMark Sellers ), dated May 17, 2016 (the  Interest Purchase Agreement ). 
Pursuant to the Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of LogicMark from the
LogicMark Sellers for (i) $17.5 million in cash consideration (ii) $2.5 million in a secured promissory note  (the
 LogicMark Note ) issued to LogicMark Investment Partners, LLC, as representative of the LogicMark Sellers (the
 LogicMark Representative )   (iii) 78,740 shares of common stock,
which were issued upon signing of the Interest Purchase Agreement (the  LogicMark Shares ), and (iv) warrants
(the  LogicMark Warrants,  and together with the WVH Warrant, the  Warrants )   to
purchase an aggregate of 157,480 shares of common stock  (the  LogicMark Warrant Shares ) for no additional
consideration. In addition, we may be required to pay the LogicMark Sellers earn-out payments of (i) up to $1,500,000 for
calendar year 2016 and (ii) up to $5,000,000 for calendar year 2017 if LogicMark meets certain gross profit targets set forth
in the Interest Purchase Agreement.  The LogicMark Note originally was to mature on Septmber 23, 2016 but was extended
to October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, the Company and the LogicMark Sellers are in the process of arranging payment on
the Note. The Note accrues interest at a rate of 15% per annum.   The LogicMark
Warrants were all exercised on July 27, 2016.    

Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the nine and three months then ended have been prepared in accordance with the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant
to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
and on the same basis as the Company prepares its annual audited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine and three months ended
September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, are unaudited, but include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the
periods presented. The results for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or for any future interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2015, has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements. However, it does not include all of the
information and notes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015,
and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. 

Reverse Stock Split   

On September 1, 2016, the Company s
board of directors and stockholders approved a resolution to amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and
to authorize the Company to effect a reverse split of the Company s outstanding common stock at a ratio of a 1-for-10
(the  Reverse Split ). On September 9, 2016, the Company effected the Reverse Split. Upon effectiveness of the
Reverse Split, every 10 shares of outstanding common stock decreased to one share of common stock. Throughout this report,
the Reverse Split was retroactively applied to all periods presented.

Note
2 - Going Concern and Management Plans   

The Company is an emerging growth entity
and incurred an operating loss of $6,107,216 and a net loss of $10,368,921 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency and stockholders  equity of $2,155,873 and
$3,602,668, respectively. In order to execute the Company s long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize its
core products and fulfill its product development commitments, the Company will need to raise additional funds, through
public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company raised $2,269,775 in net proceeds from the issuance of the Company Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, $0.0001 par value (the  Series A Preferred Stock ) and $4,090,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of
the Company s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value (the  Series B Preferred
Stock ). However, the Company can give no assurance that the cash raised prior to or subsequent to September 30, 2016,
or any additional funds raised will be sufficient to execute its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company can give no assurance that additional funds
will be available on reasonable terms, or available at all, or that it will generate sufficient revenue to alleviate
these conditions. 

The Company s ability to execute its business
plan is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity, secure debt financing, and/or generate revenue. Should the Company
not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing, or generate sufficient revenue to fund its operations, the Company would
need to curtail certain of its operational activities. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

3 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies   

Use of Estimates in
the Financial Statements    

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include stock based compensation,
derivative instruments, valuation allowances for income taxes and inventories, and other matters that affect the condensed consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Principles
of Consolidation    

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Nxt-ID and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, 3D-ID and LogicMark. The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the results of LogicMark from its acquisition date of July 25, 2016. Intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Restricted
Cash    

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had restricted cash of $40,288 and $1,534,953, respectively.
The restricted cash balance at December 31, 2015, included $1,500,000 received on December 31, 2015 as a result of the transaction
with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no restricted cash remaining from the transaction with
WorldVentures Holdings, LLC. See Note 6 for further information regarding the transaction with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC. Restricted
cash also includes amounts held back by the Company s third party credit card processor for potential customer refunds,
claims and disputes.

3 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)   

Revenue
Recognition    

The Company, including LogicMark
which was acquired on July 25, 2016, recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been
rendered or product delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or readily determinable and collectability of the sale is
reasonably assured. The Company s Wocket  sales comprise multiple element arrangements including both the
Wocket  device itself as well as unspecified future upgrades. The Company offers to all of its end-consumer customers a
period of fourteen (14) days post the actual receipt date in which to return their Wocket . The Company was unable to
reliably estimate returns at the time shipments were made during the year ended December 31, 2015, or the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, due to lack of return history. Accordingly, the Company has recognized revenue
only on those shipments whose fourteen (14) day return period had lapsed. The Company accrues for the estimated costs
associated with the one year Wocket  warranty at the time revenue associated with the sale is recorded, and periodically
updates its estimated warranty cost based on actual experience. Warranty expense during the nine months ended September 30,
2016, and September 30, 2015, was not material. 

The
Company s revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $21,353 in sales of the Wocket  to retail customers
who sell the Wocket  through their respective distribution channels. The terms and conditions of these sales provide the retail
customers with trade credit terms. In addition, these sales were made to the retailers with no rights of return and are subject
to the normal warranties offered to the ultimate consumer for product defects. There were no such sales during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Inventory    

The Company performs regular reviews of inventory
quantities on hand and evaluates the realizable value of its inventories. The Company adjusts the carrying value of the inventory
as necessary with estimated valuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory by comparing the individual inventory
parts to forecasted product demand or production requirements. As of September 30, 2016, inventory was comprised of $2,544,120
in raw materials and $2,202,979 in finished goods on hand. Inventory at December 31, 2015, was comprised of $1,587,653 in raw
materials and $180,289 in finished goods on hand. As an emerging growth entity, the Company is required to prepay for raw materials
with certain vendors until credit terms can be established. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had prepaid
inventory of $912,822 and $49,103, respectively. These prepayments were made primarily for raw materials inventory and prepaid
inventory is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Goodwill    

On July 25, 2016, the Company recorded
goodwill of $16,033,429 as a result of the LogicMark acquisition. The Company will begin testing
goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of August 1 of that year. The impairment test
consists of two steps; in step one, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value. Step two is applied
when the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is derived by deducting the fair value
of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity, and comparing that amount with the carrying
amount of goodwill. 

Other
Intangible Assets    

The
Company s intangible assets are all related to the LogicMark acquisition and are included in other intangible assets
in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The Company had no intangible assets at
December 31, 2015. 

At
September 30, 2016, the other intangible assets are comprised of patents with a fair value of $4,100,000; trademarks with a
fair value of $1,257,721; and customer relationships with a fair value of $2,956,291. The Company will amortize these
intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which for the patents, trademarks and
customer relationships are 11 years; 20 years; and 10 years, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company had amortization expense of $136,232 related to the intangible assets. 

As
of September  30, 2016, amortization expense estimated for the remainder of 2016 is approximately $184,313 and for each
of the next four fiscal years, 2017 through 2020 the amortization expense will be approximately $731,242 per year.

3 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)   

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company applies the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging and for distinguishing liabilities from equity when accounting
for hybrid contracts that feature conversion options. The accounting standards require companies to bifurcate conversion options
from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria.
The criteria includes circumstances in which (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument
are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (ii) the hybrid instrument
that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable
generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (iii) a separate instrument
with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

The
derivative is subsequently marked to market at each reporting date based on current fair value, with the changes in fair value
reported in the results of operations.  

Conversion
options that contain variable settlement features such as provisions to adjust the conversion price upon subsequent issuances
of equity or equity linked securities at exercise prices more favorable than that featured in the hybrid contract generally result
in their bifurcation from the host instrument.  

The
Company accounts for convertible debt instruments when the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should
not be bifurcated from their host instruments in accordance with ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options .
The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in
debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the
note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized
over the term of the related debt. See Note 4.  

Debt
discount and amortization of debt discount    

Debt
discount represents the fair value of embedded conversion options of various convertible debt instruments and attached convertible
equity instruments issued in connection with debt instruments. The debt discount is amortized over the earlier of (i) the term
of the debt or (ii) conversion of the debt. The amortization of debt discount is included as a component of interest expense included
in other income and expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes. 
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company will classify as income tax expense
any interest and penalties. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. Generally,
the tax authorities may examine the partnership/corporate tax returns for three years from the date of filing. The Company has
filed all of its tax returns for all prior periods through December 31, 2015. As a result, the Company s net operating loss
carryovers will now be available to offset any future taxable income.   

    Stock-Based
Compensation       

  The
Company accounts for share-based awards exchanged for employee services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. The
Company generally amortizes the employee stock-based compensation over the vesting period. The Company accounts for equity instruments
issued to non-employees at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to
periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests or becomes non-forfeitable. Non-employee stock-based compensation
charges are amortized over the vesting period or as earned.   

    Net
Loss per Share       

  Basic
loss per share was computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share includes the
effect of diluted common stock equivalents. Potentially dilutive securities realizable from the convertible Series A and Series
B Preferred Stock (defined below), and from the exercise of warrants into 1,319,049 shares of common stock as of September 30,
2016, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
Potentially dilutive securities realizable from the conversion of convertible notes and related accrued interest and from the
exercise of 424,227 warrants as of September 30, 2015, were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because
the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  

    RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     

  In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to address how certain cash receipts and cash payments
are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective
of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU 2016-15 and
does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.        

  In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  ASU 2016-12 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with
customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration.
The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update affect
narrow aspects of Topic 606 including among others: assessing collectability criterion, noncash consideration, and presentation
of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments
in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that ASU 2016-12 will have on the Company's financial position and results of operations.   

  In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 ( ASU 2016-10 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with customers
to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The amendments
in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update clarify the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the
effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-10 will
have on the Company's financial position and results of operations.       

  In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 will affect all entities that issue share-based payment
awards to their employees and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for public entities. The areas
for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s financial position and
results of operations.  

  In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02
establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the
balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition
approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently
assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

3 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall
(Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
of financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have
on the Company s financial position and results of operations.   

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
( ASU 2015-03 ), which provides guidance for simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires
that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts or premiums. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and early
adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The standard requires application on a retrospective
basis and represents a change in accounting principle. In addition, in August 2015, Accounting Standards Update 2015-15, Interest
- Imputation of Interest ( ASU 2015-15 ), was released, which codified guidance pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement
at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) meeting about the presentation and subsequent measurement
of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03
for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15 states the SEC staff would not object to an entity
deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably
over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit
arrangement. The impact of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 on the Company s financial statements includes a reclassification
of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Company s convertible notes payable to be presented in the consolidated balance
sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of those borrowings. The Company adopted this accounting guidance in the
first quarter of 2016.     

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers    ( ASU
2014-09 ), which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods
or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determine the transaction price(s); (4) allocate the transaction
price(s) to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. The guidance also requires advanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted commencing January 1, 2017. The amendments may be applied retrospectively
to each period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently
evaluating ASU 2014-09. In August 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
( ASU 2015-04 ), which defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 until annual reporting periods begin after December
15, 2017.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (    ASU
2014-15 ), amending FASB Accounting Standards Subtopic 205-40 to provide guidance about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require
an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans,
(4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans,
(5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company has adopted ASU 2014-15 and has made
the required disclosures in Note 2.

December
2015 Private Placement    

On
December 8, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  December Purchase Agreement ) with
certain accredited investors (the  December Purchasers ) pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of $1,500,000
in principal amount of Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the  December Notes ) for an aggregate purchase price of
$1,500,000 (the  December Offering ). The December Notes will mature on December 8, 2016 (the  December Maturity
Date ), less any amounts converted or redeemed prior to the December Maturity Date. The December Notes bear interest at
a rate of 8% per annum. The December Notes are convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders into
shares of common stock at a conversion price of $2.35 per share, as modified. In case of an Event of Default (as defined in the
December Notes), the December Notes are convertible at 85% of the average of the five (5) lowest daily Weighted Average Prices
(as defined in the December Notes) in the prior fifteen (15) trading days, until such Event of Default has been cured. The conversion
price is subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits, combinations or similar events. The December Notes are repayable
commencing on February 10, 2016 (the  Installment Trigger Date ). The installment payments are to be made on the l st
 and 15 th  calendar day of each month. The amount of each installment is the quotient of the original principal
amount divided by the number of installment payments between the Installment Trigger Date and the December Maturity Date. The
holder of the December Notes may opt to accelerate two (2) installment amounts in an amount up to twice the regular installment
amount. The installment payments may be made in cash or in common stock at 85% of the average of the five (5) lowest daily Weighted
Average Prices (as defined in the December Notes) in the prior fifteen (15) trading days at the option of the Company. On March
29, 2016, among other modifications of the December Notes, the conversion price was modified from $5.50 to $2.35 per share. As
a result of the modification, the Company fair valued the conversion option up to the date of modification and re-classified the
remaining conversion feature liability of $1,702,400 as of the date of modification to additional paid-in capital.  

In
connection with the sale of the December Notes, the Company also issued to the December Purchasers an aggregate of 90,000 shares
of the Company s common stock in consideration of each investor s execution and delivery of the December Purchase
Agreement (the  Commitment Shares ). The Commitment Shares were offered by the Company pursuant to an effective shelf
registration statement on Form S-3, which was initially filed with the SEC on April 24, 2015 and declared effective on May 14,
2015 (File No. 333-203637).    

As described below, the April Purchasers (defined
below) exchanged the April Convertible Notes (defined below) plus accrued but unpaid interest into the convertible notes that
were issued on December 8, 2015. As a result, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of the April Convertible Notes of
$635,986 which resulted primarily from the write off of the remaining unamortized note discount and deferred debt issue costs
on extinguishment. In order to obtain the April Purchasers  consent to issue the December Notes, and to effect the exchange,
the Company issued to each of the April Purchasers additional December Notes with a face value of $500,000. On December 8, 2015,
the total outstanding principal amount of these convertible notes was $2,134,850. On December 28, 2015, the December Purchasers
accelerated installment repayments in an aggregate amount of $350,000 which the Company satisfied by an issuance of common stock
as a result of a waiver by the holders which allowed the Company to issue common stock below $2.50 per share. As a result of this
repayment, the outstanding amount of the convertible notes held by the April Purchasers was $1,784,850 on December 31, 2015. 

The
total face amount of the December Notes outstanding on December 8, 2015 was $3,644,850.  

On
December 8, 2015 the Company recorded a debt discount of $1,719,700 and a derivative liability of $912,330.  

At
December 31, 2015, the balance on the December Notes outstanding was $3,294,850.  

The
debt discount is attributable to the value of the separately accounted for conversion feature and common stock issued in connection
with the sale of the December Notes. The embedded conversion feature derivatives relate to the conversion option, the installment
payments and the accelerated installment option of the December Notes. The embedded derivatives were evaluated under FASB ASC
 Topic 815-15,  were bifurcated from the debt host, and were classified as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the December Notes. During the nine ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $515,032 of debt discount amortization all of which was related to the December Notes.

4 - Convertible Notes Payable (Continued)   

On
February 12, 2016, in exchange for the consents given to the Company by the December Purchasers and the April Purchasers to allow
for the issuance of shares in connection with the WVH Transaction (described below), the December Notes were amended to a fixed
conversion price of $2.35. As a result of the modification, the Company fair valued the conversion option up to the date of modification
and re-classified the remaining conversion feature liability of $1,702,400 as of the date of modification to additional paid-in-capital.  

During the three months ended March 31,
2016, the holders of the December Notes accelerated $2,456,679 in installments and $253,028 of interest in exchange for
1,228,828 shares of common stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the December Purchasers converted $325,000 of
the December Notes and $26,000 of interest in exchange for 1,493,618 shares of common stock. There was no outstanding balance
on the December Notes at September 30, 2016. As it relates to the accelerated installments, the Company incurred a loss
on extinguishment of debt of $272,749. The loss on extinguishment of debt was equivalent to the excess fair value of the
common stock issued to the holders of the December Notes as compared to the net carrying value of the convertible debt. The
fair value of the common stock issued in payment of interest exceeded the amount of interest owed by $34,628. This amount
is included as part of interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

April
2015 Private Placement   

On April 24, 2015, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement (the  April Purchase Agreement ) with a group of accredited investors (the  April
Purchasers ) pursuant to which the Company sold to such purchasers an aggregate of $1,575,000 principal amount of secured
convertible notes (the  April Convertible Notes ), Class A Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the  Class A Warrants 
and each a  Class A Warrant ) to purchase up to 46,875 shares of the Company s
common stock, and Class B Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the  Class B Warrants , and each a  Class B Warrant 
the Class A Warrants and the Class B Warrants, collectively, the  April Warrants ) to purchase up to 46,875 shares
of the Company s common stock. The Convertible Notes bear interest at 6% per annum and are convertible at any time, in whole
or in part, at the option of the holders into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $25.20 per share. The April Warrants
are exercisable beginning on October 24, 2015, through October 24, 2020. The Class A Warrants have an initial exercise price equal
to $30.20 per share and the Class B Warrants have an initial exercise price equal to $50.00 per share. The Company received cash
proceeds of $1,481,500 from the issuance of the April Convertible Notes after deducting debt issuance costs of $93,500. 

The Company recorded a debt discount of $1,575,000
related to the sale of the April Convertible Notes and the April Warrants. The debt discount reflects the underlying fair value
of the April Warrants of approximately $860,000 on the date of the transaction and a beneficial conversion charge of approximately
$715,000. During the period April 23, 2015 through December 8, 2015, the Company amortized $983,836 of the debt discount as a
component of interest expense. 

As
described above, the April Purchasers exchanged the April Convertible Notes into the convertible notes that were issued on December
8, 2015. Additionally, as part of the modifications described above the security interests set forth in the April Security Agreement
were terminated.

Note
5   Derivative liabilities   

Fair
value of financial instruments is defined as an exit price, which is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or
paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of
judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of pricing observability.
Financial assets and liabilities with readily available, actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively
quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and require less judgment in measuring fair value. Conversely,
financial assets and liabilities that are rarely traded or not quoted have less price observability and are generally measured
at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation
and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency of the asset, liability or market and the nature of the
asset or liability. The Company has categorized its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level
hierarchy.  

The
conversion features embedded within the December Notes did not have fixed settlement provisions on the date they were initially
issued because the conversion price could be lowered if certain provisions included in the December Notes occur before conversion.  

During
2015, the derivative liabilities were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the following weighted average assumptions
on   December 31, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had five separate valuations performed
using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The valuations coincided with the number of accelerated installments occurring during
the three months ended March 31, 2016. The table for 2016 reflects the range of weighted average assumptions used for the 2016
valuations.  

The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve. Since the Company s stock has not been publicly
traded for a sufficiently long enough period of time, the Company is utilizing an expected volatility figure based on a review
of the historical volatilities, over a period of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being valued, of similarly
positioned public companies within its industry. The expected life of the conversion feature was determined by the maturity date
of the Note and the expected life of the various warrants was determined by their expiration dates. The expected dividend yield
was based upon the fact that the Company has not historically paid dividends on its common stock, and does not expect to pay dividends
on its common stock in the future.  

Fair
Value Measurement   

The
carrying amounts of cash, inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, other current liabilities and
other long-term liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The Company s other financial
instruments include its convertible notes payable obligations. The carrying value of these instruments approximate fair
value, as they bear terms and conditions comparable to market, for obligations with similar terms and maturities. The Company
measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

6   Strategic Agreements with world ventures holdings   

On
December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a Master Product Development Agreement (the  Development Agreement )
with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC ( WVH ). The Development Agreement commenced on December 31, 2015, and has an
initial term of two (2) years (the  Initial Term ). Thereafter, the Development Agreement will automatically
renew for additional successive one (1) year terms (each a  Renewal Term ) unless and until WVH provides written
notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term. Each
Renewal Term will commence immediately on expiration of the Initial Term or preceding Renewal Term. The Development Agreement
may also be terminated earlier pursuant to certain conditions.  

In
connection with the Development Agreement, on December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the
 WVH Purchase Agreement ) with WVH providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of 1,005,000 shares (the
 WVH Shares ) of Common Stock and a common stock purchase warrant (the  WVH Warrant ) to purchase 251,250
shares (the  WVH Warrant Shares ) of Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000. The WVH Warrant
is initially exercisable on May 31, 2016, at an exercise price equal to $7.50 per share and has a term of exercise equal to two
(2) years and seven (7) months from the date on which first exercisable. On April 28, 2016, the exercise price of the WVH Warrant
was modified to $4.00.  

Pursuant
to the Development Agreement, WVH retained the Company to design, develop and manufacture a series of Proprietary Products (as
defined in the Development Agreement) for distribution through WVH s network of sales representatives, members, consumers,
employees, contractors or affiliates. In conjunction with the Development Agreement, the Company and WVH contractually agreed
to dedicate $1,500,000 of the $2,000,000 in total proceeds received by the Company from the WVH Purchase Agreement to the development
and manufacture of the product for WVH. In addition, the $1,500,000 is restricted and the Company is required to obtain prior
approval from WVH on a monthly basis in order to fund the estimated expenditures needed for the development of the product for
WVH from the $1,500,000. Accordingly, the $1,500,000 was included in the restricted cash balance on the accompanying condensed
consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s restricted cash balance did not
include any remaining restricted cash from the WVH transaction on December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company used the entire $1,500,000 in restricted cash received from WVH on December 31, 2015 for the design and development
of products specifically for WVH. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received deposits totaling $2,679,005
from WVH against initial purchase orders received from WVH. The deposits received from WVH are included in the balance sheet line
item labeled customer deposits on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.

On January 13, 2014, the Company closed a
 best efforts  private offering of $1,000,000 (the  January Offering ) with a group of accredited investors
(the  January Purchasers ) and the Company exercised the oversubscription amount allowed in the January Offering of
$350,000, for total gross proceeds to the Company of $1,350,000 before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses. Pursuant
to a securities purchase agreement with the January Purchasers (the  January Purchase Agreement ), the Company issued
to the January Purchasers (i) 41,539 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 and (ii) warrants (the  January

the January Offering in December 2013 and January 2014 were $56,820 and $100,006, respectively. In January 2014, the placement
agent received 4,154 warrants to purchase 4,154 shares of the Company s common stock as fees. 

Pursuant
to the January Purchase Agreement, the Company s founders who are members of management (the  Founders ) agreed
to cancel a corresponding number of shares to those shares issued in the January Offering and place in escrow a corresponding
number of shares to be cancelled for each January Warrant Share issued. As a result, the Founders retired 13,846 and 27,692 shares
of common stock in December 2013 and January 2014, respectively.  

The
January Warrants are exercisable for a period of five (5) years from the original issue date. The initial exercise price with
respect to the January Warrants was $32.50 per share. On the date of issuance, the January Warrants were recognized as derivative
liabilities as they did not have fixed settlement provisions because their exercise prices could be lowered if the Company was
to issue securities at a lower price in the future. As a result, the Company recorded $3,450,976 as derivative liability warrants
on the condensed consolidated balance sheet on January 13, 2014.  

On February 21, 2014, the Company amended
the terms of the 139,154 January Warrants issued in the January Offering as compensation to the placement agent to eliminate the
anti-dilution provision and to lower the exercise price of the January Warrants from $32.50 to $30.00. As a result of the January
Warrant modifications, the Company re-measured the January Warrants  liability on the modification date and recorded an
unrealized gain on derivative liabilities of $448,072 and reclassified the aggregate re-measured value of the January Warrants
of $4,514,772 to additional paid-in capital. 

On
various dates during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the Company received gross proceeds of $1,500,000 in connection
with the exercise of 50,000 January Warrants into 50,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $30.00 per share, net
of $30,000 paid upon the exercise of the January Warrants issued in the January Offering per the terms of the placement agent
agreement. Upon exercise, pursuant to the January Purchase Agreement, the Founders cancelled a certain number of shares of common
stock in accordance with the January Purchase Agreement.  

On
September 10, 2014, the exercise price of the January Warrants was amended to $20.00.  

Effective
March 5, 2015, the January Purchasers holding a majority of the securities offered in the January 2014 offering waived a provision
that required the Founders to surrender shares of common stock proportional to the number of January Warrants exercised. To date,
these Founders have retired 69,705 shares of common stock which will remain in treasury.  

On April 23, 2015, the Company entered into
a waiver and termination of certain rights agreement (the  Waiver Agreement ) whereby the majority of January Purchasers
agreed to terminate certain provisions in the January Purchase Agreement for an aggregate of 25,000 shares of common stock, including,
without limitation, the cancellation of corresponding shares by the Founders. The fair value of the 25,000 shares of common stock
issued on April 23, 2015, was $655,000 and was recorded as inducement expense by the Company.

a private offering with a group of accredited investors (the  June Purchasers ) who had previously participated in
the January Offering that occurred between December 30, 2013, and January 13, 2014. Pursuant to a securities purchase agreement
with the June Purchasers, the Company issued to the June Purchasers warrants (the  June Warrants ) to purchase an
aggregate of 40,000 shares (the  June Shares ) of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $30.00
per share. On September 10, 2014, the exercise price of the June Warrants was amended to $20.00. The June Warrants are exercisable
for a period of five (5) years from the original issue date. The exercise price for the June Warrants is subject to adjustment
upon certain events, such as stock splits, combinations, dividends, distributions, reclassifications, mergers or other corporate
change and dilutive issuances. 

In
connection with the issuance of the June Warrants, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the June Purchasers
pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the June Shares on a Form S-1 registration statement (the  June Registration
Statement ) to be filed with the SEC ninety (90) days following the completion of an underwritten public offering (the  June
Filing Date ) and to cause the June Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act within ninety
(90) days following the June Filing Date (the  June Required Effective Date ).  

The
June Registration Statement was not filed by the June Filing Date or declared effective by the June Required Effective Date of
December 15, 2014. Under the original terms of the arrangement, the Company was required to pay partial liquidated damages to
each June Purchaser in the amount equal to two percent (2%) for the purchase price paid for the June Warrants then owned by such
June Purchaser for each 30-day period for which the Company is non-compliant.  On January 30, 2015, the Company received
signed documentation from all of the June Purchasers waiving their right to liquidated damages and terminating the registration
rights agreement.  

On
February 23, 2016, the exercise price of the June Warrants was amended to $5.00.  

August

On August 21, 2014, pursuant to a securities
purchase agreement with two Purchasers (the  August Purchasers ) who had previously participated in the January Offering,
the Company issued to the August Purchasers warrants (the  August Warrants ) to purchase an aggregate of 10,000 shares
(the  August Shares ) of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $30.00 per share. On September 10,
2014, the exercise price of the August Warrants was amended to $20.00.  The August Warrants are exercisable for a period
of five (5) years from the original issue date. The exercise price for the August Warrants is subject to adjustment upon certain
events, such as stock splits, combinations, dividends, distributions, reclassifications, mergers, or other corporate changes and
dilutive issuances. 

In
connection with the issuance of the August Warrants, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the August
Purchasers pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the August Shares on a Form S-1 registration statement (the August
Registration Statement ) to be filed with the SEC ninety (90) days following the filing date (the  August Filing Date )
and to cause the August Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act by the required effective date
(the  August Effective Date ).

from all of the August Purchasers waiving their right to liquidated damages and terminating the registration rights agreement.  

The
Company determined that the effect of the issuance of the June Warrants and the August Warrants was to induce the January Purchasers
to exercise the January Warrants previously issued to them in the January Offering. As a result, the Company recorded inducement
expense of $1,262,068 during the year ended December 31, 2014.

8   acquisition of LogicMark llc   

On
July 25, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of LogicMark, LLC ( LogicMark ) pursuant to an Interest Purchase
Agreement by and among the Company, LogicMark and the holders of all of the membership interests of LogicMark (the  LogicMark
Sellers ), dated May 17, 2016 (the  Interest Purchase Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Interest Purchase Agreement,
the Company acquired all of the membership interests of LogicMark from the LogicMark Sellers for (i) $17.5 million in cash consideration
(ii) $2.5 million in a secured promissory note   (the
 LogicMark Note ) issued to LogicMark Investment Partners, LLC, as representative of the LogicMark Sellers (the  LogicMark
Representative )   (iii) 78,740 shares of common stock, which were issued upon
signing of the Interest Purchase Agreement (the  LogicMark Shares ), and (iv) warrants (the  LogicMark Warrants, 
and together with the WVH Warrant, the  Warrants ) to purchase an aggregate of 157,480 shares of common stock  (the
 LogicMark Warrant Shares ) for no additional consideration. In addition, we may be required to pay the LogicMark
Sellers earn-out payments of (i) up to $1,500,000 for calendar year 2016 and (ii) up to $5,000,000 for calendar year 2017 if LogicMark
meets certain gross profit targets set forth in the Interest Purchase Agreement.  The LogicMark Note matures on September
23, 2016 and accrues interest at a rate of 15% per annum.   The earn-out provision of
$1,500,000 for calendar year 2016 is included on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet as other current liabilities
- contingent consideration and the earn-out provision of $5,000,000 for calendar year 2017 is included as other long-term liabilities
- contingent consideration. The Company determined that as of July 25, 2016, it was more likely than not that these gross profit
targets would be achieved and any fair value adjustment of the Earnout was not material. The LogicMark Warrants were all exercised
on July 27, 2016.      

  On
July 25, 2016, the Company and a group of lenders, including ExWorks Capital Fund I, L.P. as agent for the lenders (collectively,

Financing ). The maturity date of the Revolving Loan is July 25, 2017, and the Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate of
15% per annum.   

  The
Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, including a covenant that the Company shall not permit the ratio of (a) EBITDA
for each of the following periods, minus unfinanced capital expenditures, to (b) fixed charges for such periods to be less

 The Company has the ability to extend
the Revolver for two additional years at its sole discretion  with
no subjective acceleration by the lender, provided the Company is not in default on the loan. As a result, the Company has recorded
the revolver as long-term debt on its  condensed consolidated balance sheet.    

  On
September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with LogicMark Investment Partners, LLC (the  Lender ) 
in connection with a Secured Subordinated Promissory Note originally issued on July 22, 2016 in the amount of $2,500,000, which
expired on September 22, 2016 (the  Note ). The Company formally requested that the Lender  extend the Note on
September 20, 2016, and finalized the amendment on September 23, 2016.     

  Under
the terms of the forbearance agreement, the Lender agreed to extend the Note and the Company agreed to pay to the Lender in immediately
available funds: (i) $250,000 on September 23, 2016; (ii) $100,000 on October 24, 2016; and (iii) $1,150,000, plus all accrued
and unpaid interest due under the Note on October 31, 2016. The Company also agreed to reduce the Escrow Amount (as defined in
the Purchase Agreement) by a total of $500,000, and to make certain other changes to the definition of  Escrow Amount 
in the Purchase Agreement. The Company also agreed to make certain representations and warranties in respect of the Lender s
forbearance. As of October 31, 2016, the Company and the LogicMark Sellers are in the process of arranging payment on the Note.     

   Allocation
of Purchase Price      

  The
purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of LogicMark based upon
their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated
to goodwill. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of the fair value of the net assets acquired through the
use of an independent valuation firm and management s estimates. Since the following information is based on preliminary
assessments made by management, the acquisition accounting for LogicMark is subject to final adjustment and it is possible that
the final assessment of values may differ from the preliminary assessment. The following table summarizes the preliminary assessment
of the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed net of cash acquired, as of the date
of acquisition of July 25, 2016.

Pro
Forma Financial Information   

The
following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma financial information assuming that the LogicMark acquisition had occurred
on January 1, 2015, and its results had been included in the Company s financial results for the full nine and three month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The pro forma combined amounts are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable
estimate of the effects of the LogicMark acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein. The following unaudited
pro forma combined financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the
financial position or results of operations would have been had the LogicMark acquisition in fact occurred on the date assumed,
nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods.  

The unaudited pro forma net loss attributable
to Nxt-ID, Inc. has been calculated using actual historical information and is adjusted for certain pro forma adjustments based
on the assumption that the LogicMark acquisition and the application of fair value adjustments to intangible assets occurred on
January 1, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the pro forma financial information excluded the acquisition-related
expenses of $275,948 and $609,466, respectively, which are included in the actual reported results, but excluded from the pro
forma amounts above due to their nonrecurring nature. In addition, the pro forma adjustments for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 include the following adjustments, (a) amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets of $48,082
and $410,697, respectively; (b) interest expense including the amortization of deferred debt issue costs of $334,034 and $2,851,185,
respectively; (c) reduction in depreciation expense of $15,719 and $28,935, respectively; and (d) amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment of $nil and $945,212, respectively. 

For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the pro forma financial information reflects the following adjustments, , (a) amortization expense related
to the acquired intangible assets of $184,314 and $546,929, respectively; (b) interest expense including the amortization of deferred
debt issue costs of $1,279,440 and $3,796,601, respectively; (c) reduction in depreciation expense of $3,008 and $9,024, respectively;

Overview

Nxt-ID,
Inc. (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation formed on February 8, 2012. We were initially known as Trylon Governmental
Systems, Inc. We changed our name to Nxt-ID, Inc. on June 25, 2012 to reflect our primary focus on our growing security, biometric
identification, m-commerce and secure mobile platforms.   

On
June 25, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in 3D-ID LLC   ( 3D-ID ), a limited
liability company formed in Florida in February 2011 and owned by the Company s founders .
By acquiring 3D-ID, the Company gained the rights to a portfolio of patented technology in the field of three-dimensional facial
recognition and imaging including 3D facial recognition products for access control, law enforcement and travel and immigration.   3D-ID
was an early stage company engaged in the design, research and development, integration, analysis, modeling, system networking,
sales and support of intelligent surveillance, three-dimensional facial recognition and three-dimensional imaging devices and
systems primarily for identification and access control in the security industries. Since the Company s acquisition of 3D-ID
was a transaction between entities under common control in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
805,  Business Combinations , Nxt-ID recognized the net assets of 3D-ID at their carrying amounts in the accounts
of Nxt-ID on the date that 3D-ID was organized, February 14, 2011.  

On
July 25, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of LogicMark, LLC ( LogicMark ) pursuant to an Interest
Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, LogicMark and the holders of all of the membership interests of LogicMark (the
 LogicMark Sellers ), dated May 17, 2016 (the  Interest Purchase Agreement ).  Pursuant to the
Interest Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the membership interests of LogicMark from the LogicMark Sellers for (i)
$17.5 million in cash consideration (ii) $2.5 million in a secured promissory note   (the
 LogicMark Note ) issued to LogicMark Investment Partners, LLC, as representative of the LogicMark Sellers (the
 LogicMark Representative )   (iii) 78,740 shares of common stock,
which were issued upon signing of the Interest Purchase Agreement (the  LogicMark Shares ), and (iv) warrants
(the  LogicMark Warrants,  and together with the WVH Warrant, the  Warrants ) to purchase an
aggregate of 157,480 shares of common stock  (the  LogicMark Warrant Shares ) for no additional
consideration. In addition, we may be required to pay the LogicMark Sellers earn-out payments of (i) up to $1,500,000 for
calendar year 2016 and (ii) up to $5,000,000 for calendar year 2017 if LogicMark meets certain gross profit targets set forth
in the Interest Purchase Agreement.  The LogicMark Note had a maturity date of September 23, 2016 but was extended to
October 31, 2016. As of October 31, 2016, the Company and the LogicMark Sellers are in the process of arranging payment on
the Note. It accrues interest at a rate of 15% per annum.  The
LogicMark Warrants   were all exercised on July 27, 2016. 

On
July 25, 2016, the Company and a group of lenders, including ExWorks Capital Fund I, L.P. as agent for the lenders (collectively,
the  Lenders ), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ), whereby the Lenders
extended a revolving loan (the  Revolving Loan ) to the Company in the principal amount of $15,000,000 (the  Debt
Financing ). The maturity date of the Revolving Loan is July 25, 2017, and the Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate of
15% per annum.   

We
are a security technology company that is focused on products, solutions, and services for security in finance, assets and
healthcare. Our core technologies consist of those that support digital payments, biometric identification, encryption,
sensors, and miniaturization. We have four distinct lines of business that we are currently pursuing, which are in various
stages of development: mobile commerce ( m-commerce ), primarily through the application of secure digital
payment technologies, biometric access control applications, Department of Defense contracting and security in healthcare
through medical alert systems. Our initial efforts have primarily focused on the development of our secure products for the
growing m-commerce market. On December 31, 2015, we entered into a Master Product Development Agreement (the
 Development Agreement ) with WorldVentures Holdings, LLC ( WVH ). The Development Agreement
commenced on December 31, 2015, and has an initial term of two (2) years (the  Initial Term ). Thereafter, the
Development Agreement will automatically renew for additional successive one (1) year terms (each a
 Renewal Term ) unless and until WVH provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to
the end of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term. The Company currently has a purchase order for up to $15 million
to supply innovative smart cards designed exclusively for WVH.  

We
believe that our MobileBio  products will provide distinct advantages within the m-commerce market by improving mobile security.
Currently most mobile devices continue to be protected simply by PIN numbers. This security methodology is easily duplicated on
another device and can easily be spoofed or hacked. Our security paradigm is Dynamic Pairing Codes ( DPC ). DPC is
a new, proprietary method, to secure users, devices, accounts, locations and servers over any communication media by sharing key
identifiers, including biometric-enabled identifiers, between end-points by passing dynamic pairing codes (random numbers) between
end-points to establish sessions and/or transactions without exposing identifiers or keys. The recent high-level breaches of personal
credit card data raises serious concerns among consumers about the safety of their money. These consumers are also resistant to
letting technology companies learn even more about their personal purchasing habits.  

Our
plan also anticipates that we will use our core biometric facial and voice recognition algorithms to develop security applications
(both cloud based and locally hosted) that can be used for companies (for industrial uses, such as enterprise computer networks)
as well as individuals (for consumer uses, such as smart phones, tablets or personal computers), law enforcement, the defense
industry, and the U.S. Department of Defense. Our biometric access control applications and defense contracting opportunities
are still in their emerging growth stages.  

The
Company s wholly owned subsidiary, LogicMark, LLC, manufactures and distributes nonmonitored and monitored personal emergency
response systems sold through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, healthcare
durable medical equipment dealers and distributors and monitored security dealers and distributors.  

We
have incurred net losses since our inception. In order to execute our long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize our
core products we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means.
We can give no assurance that the cash raised subsequent to September 30, 2016 or any additional funds raised will be sufficient
to execute our business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We can
give no assurance that additional funds will be available on reasonable terms, or available at all, or that it will generate sufficient
revenue to alleviate these conditions.   

We
commenced shipping of the Wocket  at the end of the second quarter of 2015, primarily to tech savvy consumers. The
implementation of the EMV chip point of sale ( POS ) terminals in the United States has limited the number of POS
systems where the Wocket  can be used, so we have postponed the full launch of the product in the United States until
we are able to implement Near Field Communication ( NFC ) technology on the Wocket  as well as our
dynamic magnetic stripe technology. NFC is a similar technology to ApplePay and AndroidPay and works at many EMV enabled
POS Terminals. We intend to re-launch Wocket  in the United States once NFC is operational. Current Wocket  inventory
is hardware enabled for this purpose and we are finalizing the software arrangements with banks and major payment companies
to implement this technology. We anticipate re-introducing the Wocket  in the United States with NFC capability in 2017
as our current resources are focused on maximizing the WVH opportunity.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    

Revenue.  Our
revenues for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,174,151 and $3,093,356, respectively. Our revenues for
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 were $533,529 and $418,128, respectively. The increase in revenues for the
nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily
attributable to the LogicMark acquisition and to a lesser extent the billing to WVH for engineering services
related to the smart card. The LogicMark operating results are included from the acquisition date of July 25, 2016 through September
30, 2016. Our revenues for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 also included shipments of the Wocket  for new
customer orders, whereas our revenues for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2015 were mostly related to the shipments
of the Wocket  to our early access pre-order customers.  

Cost
of Revenue.   

The
increase in our gross margin for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to the
inclusion of the LogicMark operating results for the period July 25, 2016 through September 30, 2016. Our gross margin
continues to be negatively impacted by selling the Wocket  in small quantities to wholesale customers below cost as well
as incurring  scrap expense relating primarily to low early stage production yield. We expect that our future
selling price to wholesale customers will continue to be less on a per unit basis as compared to our selling price per unit
to our direct customers until we relaunch the product with NFC capability, which we anticipate to be in 2017. Based on the
composition of our order intake during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016, we do not believe that any further
lower of cost or market adjustment is required.

Our
operating expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015
remained relatively flat at approximately $7,300,000. Our research and development expenses relating to the development of
the Company s biometric wallet, as well as our advertising and promotional expenses, decreased for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 versus the corresponding period in 2015. These reductions in expenses were offset by higher

the LogicMark acquisition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company received proceeds of $650,000 in
connection with the exercise of 325,000 warrants into 325,000 shares of common stock. In addition, the Company received
$1,481,500 in net proceeds from the issuance of April Convertible Notes on April 24, 2015, and we received $2,494,522 in net
proceeds related to the August 4, 2015 equity offering.  

Sources
of Liquidity.  We are an early stage company and have generated losses from operations since inception.  We incurred a
net loss of $10,368,921 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included an aggregate $4,717,109 of adjustments
to reconcile the Company s net loss to net cash used in operating activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
negative working capital and stockholders  equity of $2,155,873 and $3,602,668, respectively.  

In
order to execute the Company s long-term strategic plan to develop and commercialize its core products, the Company
will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other means. The Company
can give no assurance that the cash raised prior to or subsequent to September 30, 2016, or any additional funds raised, will
be sufficient to execute its business plan. Additionally, the Company can give no assurance that additional funds will be
available on reasonable terms, or available at all, or that it will generate sufficient revenue to alleviate the going
concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a  going
concern.   

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have
not entered into any synthetic leases. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit
risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.   

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is intended to address how certain cash receipts and cash payments
are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective
of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU 2016-15 and
does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.     

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 ( ASU 2016-12 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  ASU 2016-12 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with
customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration.
The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update affect
narrow aspects of Topic 606 including among others: assessing collectability criterion, noncash consideration, and presentation
of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments
in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that ASU 2016-12 will have on the Company's financial position and results of operations.   

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 ( ASU 2016-10 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 will affect all entities that enter into contracts with customers
to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The amendments
in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective, the amendments in this update clarify the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related
principles for those areas. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the
effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-10 will
have on the Company's financial position and results of operations.   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share- Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 will affect all entities that issue share-based payment
awards to their employees and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for public entities. The areas
for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s financial position and
results of operations.   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02
establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the
balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition
approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently
assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall
(Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU 2016-01 ), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
of financial instrument. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have
on the Company s financial position and results of operations.   

In
April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ), which provides guidance for simplifying the presentation
of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This guidance will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously
issued. The standard requires application on a retrospective basis and represents a change in accounting principle. In addition,
in August 2015, Accounting Standards Update 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest ( ASU 2015-15 ), was released,
which codified guidance pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) meeting
about the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Given the
absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15
states the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing
the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any
outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The impact of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 on the Company s financial
statements includes a reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Company s convertible notes payable
to be presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of those borrowings. The Company
adopted this accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2016.   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:
(1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determine the transaction
price(s); (4) allocate the transaction price(s) to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and (5) recognize revenue when
(or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also requires advanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption not permitted. The amendments may be applied
retrospectively to each period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company
is currently evaluating ASU 2014-09. In August 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers ( ASU 2015-04 ), which defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 until annual reporting periods begin
after December 15, 2017.   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), amending FASB Accounting Standards Subtopic 205-40 to provide
guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition
of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, (3) provide principles for considering
the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that financial statements are issued. ASU
2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The
Company has adopted ASU 2014-15 and has made the required disclosures in Note 2.   

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

We
are not required to provide the information required by this Item since we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in rule
12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).     

Item
4.  Controls and Procedures    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016. As discussed below, based on this evaluation, our management concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   

As
a result of the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting described below, we concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 were not effective. As of September 30, 2016, we have identified certain matters
that constituted a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Specifically, we have difficulty in accounting
for complex accounting transactions due to an insufficient number of accounting personnel with experience in that area and limited
segregation of duties within our accounting and financial reporting functions.  

Limitations
of the Effectiveness of Control   

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any control system, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Controls   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

From
time to time we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our
business. Other than as described herein, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any
court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, or any of our
subsidiaries in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, or
financial condition.   

Item
1A. Risk Factors
