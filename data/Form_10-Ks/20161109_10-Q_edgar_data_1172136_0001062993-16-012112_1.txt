 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Unaudited  
 September 30, 2016   
  NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   
 U.S. Geothermal Inc. ( the Company ) was incorporated on March
10, 2000 in the State of Delaware. U.S. Geothermal Inc.   Idaho was formed in
February 2002, and is the primary subsidiary through which the Company conducts
its operations. The Company constructs, manages and operates power plants that
utilize geothermal resources to produce energy. The Company s operations have
been, primarily, focused in the Western United States of America.  
   Basis of Presentation   
 These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim
financial reporting. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In our opinion, the unaudited
consolidated financial statements include all material adjustments, all of which
are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary to present fairly our financial
position as of September 30, 2016 and our operating results and cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The accompanying financial
information as of December 31, 2015, is derived from audited financial
statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full
year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be
read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.  
 The Company consolidates subsidiaries that it controls
(more-than-50% owned) and entities over which control is achieved through means
other than voting rights. These consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as three
controlling interests. The accounts of the following companies are consolidated
in these financial statements:

 All intercompany transactions are eliminated upon
consolidation.  
 In cases where the Company owns a majority interest in an
entity but does not own 100% of the interest in the entity, it recognizes a
non-controlling interest attributed to the interest controlled by outside third
parties. The Company will recognize 100% of the assets and liabilities of the
entity, and disclose the non-controlling interest. The statements of income will
consolidate the subsidiary s full operations, and will separately disclose the
elimination of the non-controlling interest s allocation of profits and losses.
 
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 The Company considers all unrestricted cash, short-term
deposits, and other investments with original maturities of no more than ninety
days when acquired to be cash and cash equivalents. 
   Trade Accounts Receivable Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts    
 Management estimates the amount of trade accounts receivable
that may not be collectible and records an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
allowance is an estimate based upon aging of receivable balances, historical
collection experience, and the periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
financial condition. Receivable balances are written off when we determine that
the balance is uncollectible. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
there were no balances that were over 90 days past due and no balance in
allowance for doubtful accounts was recognized. 
   Concentration of Credit Risk    
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents, including restricted
cash, consisted of commercial bank deposits, money market accounts, and petty
cash. Cash deposits are held in commercial banks in Boise, Idaho and Portland,
Oregon. Deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) up to $250,000 per legal entity. At September 30, 2016, the Company s
total cash balance, excluding money market funds, was $6,628,747 and bank
deposits amounted to $6,932,724. The primary difference was due to outstanding
checks and deposits. Of the bank deposits, $5,649,178 was not covered by or was
in excess of FDIC insurance guaranteed limits. At September 30, 2016, the
Company s money market funds invested, primarily, in government backed
securities totaled $33,617,617 and were not subject to deposit insurance. A
contracted power purchaser held a security bond for the Company that totaled
$1,468,898 at September 30, 2016.  
   Property, Plant and Equipment   
 Property, plant and equipment, including assets under capital
lease, are recorded at historical cost. Costs of acquisition of geothermal
properties are capitalized in the period of acquisition. Major improvements that
significantly increase the useful lives and/or capabilities of the assets are
capitalized. A primary factor in determining whether to capitalize construction
type costs is the stage of the potential project s development. Once a project
is determined to be commercially viable, all costs directly associated with the
development and construction of the project are capitalized. Until that time,
all development costs are expensed. A commercially viable project will have,
among other factors, a reservoir discovery well or other significant geothermal
surface anomaly, a power transmission path that is identified and available, and
an electricity off-taker identified. A valid reservoir discovery is generally
defined when a test well has been substantially completed that indicates the
presence of a geothermal reservoir that has a high probability of possessing the
necessary temperatures, permeability, and flow rates. After a valid discovery
has been made, the project enters the development stage. Generally, all costs
incurred during the development stage are capitalized and tracked on an
individual project basis. If a geothermal project is abandoned, the associated
costs that have been capitalized are charged to expense in the year of
abandonment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as
incurred. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of defined
major projects from debt that is specifically incurred for those projects are
capitalized. Funds received from grants associated with capital projects reduce
the cost of the asset directly associated with the individual grants. The offset
of the cost of the asset associated with grant proceeds is recorded in the
period when the requirements of the grant are substantially complete and the
amount can be reasonably estimated.  
 -9-  

Direct labor costs, incurred for specific major projects
expected to have long-term benefits will be capitalized. Direct labor costs
subject to capitalization include employee salaries, as well as, related payroll
taxes and benefits. With respect to the allocation of salaries to projects,
salaries are allocated based on the percentage of hours that our key managers,
engineers and scientists work on each project and are invoiced to the project
each month. These individuals track their time worked at each project. Major
projects are, generally, defined as projects expected to exceed $500,000. Direct
labor includes all of the time incurred by employees directly involved with
construction and development activities. General and/or indirect management time
and time spent evaluating the feasibility of potential projects is expensed when
incurred. Employee training time is expensed when incurred.  
 Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the asset. Where appropriate, terms of property rights
and revenue contracts can influence the determination of estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives in years by major asset categories are summarized as
follows:  

Estimated Useful  

Asset Categories

Lives in Years  

Furniture, vehicle and other equipment  
       
     3 to 5

     30   
   
     Transmission lines  
       
     30    

   Stock Compensation    
 The Company accounts for stock based compensation by recording
the estimated fair value of stock-based awards granted as compensation expense
over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and
the quoted price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The fair
value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date as calculated by the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense is
attributed to earnings for stock options and restricted stock on the
straight-line method. The Company estimates forfeitures of stock-based awards
based on historical experience and expected future activity.    
   Earnings Per Share    
 Basic income or loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and excludes any
dilutive effects of common stock equivalent shares, such as options and
restricted stock awards. Restricted stock awards ( RSAs ) are considered
outstanding and included in the computation of basic income or loss per share
when underlying restrictions expire and the awards are no longer forfeitable.
Diluted income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the
period using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalent shares are
excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. In a period where
the Company is in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is computed
using the basic share count.  
 -10-  

Foreign Currency Translation   
 The Company s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Monetary
items are converted into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Resulting gains and losses are generally included in determining net
income for the period in which exchange rates change. 
   Revenue    
   Revenue Recognition      
  Energy Sales   The energy sales revenue is recognized
when the electrical power generated by the Company s power plants is delivered
to the customer who is reasonably assured to be able to pay under the terms
defined by the Power Purchase Agreements ( PPAs ).  
  Renewable Energy Credits ( RECs )   Currently, the
Company operates three plants that produce renewable energy that creates a right
to a REC. The Company earns one REC for each megawatt hour produced from the
geothermal power plant. The Company considers the RECs to be outputs that are an
economic benefit obtained directly through the operation of the plants. The
Company does not currently hold any RECs for our own use. Revenues from RECs
sales are recognized when the Company has met the terms and conditions of
certain energy sales agreements with a financially capable buyer. At Raft River
Energy I LLC, each REC is certified by the Western Electric Coordinating Council
and sold under a REC Purchase and Sales Agreement to Holy Cross Energy. At San
Emidio and Neal Hot Springs, the RECs are owned by our customer and are bundled
with energy sales. At all three plants, title for the RECs pass during the same
month as energy sales. As a result, costs associated with the sale of RECs are
not segregated on the consolidated statement of income. 
   Revenue Source      
 All of the Company s operating revenues (energy sales and
energy credit sales) originate from energy production from its interests in
geothermal power plants located in the states of Idaho, Oregon and Nevada. 
  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
 Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements.
The following pronouncements were deemed applicable to our financial statements:
 
   Statement of Cash Flows      In August
2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 ( Update 2016-15 ) ,
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments.  Update 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
This Update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. It is likely that some of the
provisions of this Update 2016-15 will apply to certain transactions our Company
may engage in. Management is currently evaluating the possible impact this
Update may have on the presentation of the Company s consolidated statements of
cash flows. 
 -11-  

Revenue Recognition      In May 2014, FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( Update 2014-09 ),  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  Update 2014-09 amends the revenue
recognition guidance and requires more detailed disclosures to enable financial
statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainties of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers .  In April
2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 ( Update 2016-10 ),
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identify Performance
Obligations and Licensing.  In March 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-08 ( Update 2016-08 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net).  In May 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-12 ( Updated 2016-12 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606), Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  Both Update
2016-10 and 2016-08 provide additional guidance on how an entity should
recognize revenue when depicting the transfer of promised goods or services.
These Updates provide more guidance on identifying performance obligations and
licensing. Update 2016-12 provides additional clarification to the steps an
entity should follow to achieve the core principle of Topic 606. The guidance,
as amended, is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for public companies
effective from annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 31,
2016. Management will continue to evaluate the possible impact that the guidance
defined by these four Updates may have on future consolidated financial
statements. 
   Stock Compensation      In March 2016, FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( Update 2016-09 ),
 Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting.  Update 2016-09 provides guidance designed to
simplify of the accounting treatment of certain matters surrounding share-based
compensation. Update 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Changes
related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum
statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be
applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of
cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in
which the guidance is adopted. It is likely that some of the guidance in Update
2016-09, related to public entities, will apply to our Company. Management is
currently evaluating the possible impact this Update may have on the financial
presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.    
   Leases      In February 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02 ( Update 2016-02 ),  Leases (Topic 842).  Update 2016-02 recognizes
lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosing
key information about leasing arrangements. Under previous standards, assets and
liabilities were only recognized for leases that met the definition of a capital
lease. Our preliminary review indicates that certain of the Company s lease
contracts would be subject to the reporting requirements defined by Update
2016-02. The Update is effective for public companies with fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted. In transition, the Company would be required
to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period being
presented using a modified retrospective approach. Management is still
evaluating the possible impact this Update may have on the financial
presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3   RESTRICTED CASH AND SECURITY BOND RESERVES  
 Under the terms of the loan agreements with the Department of
Energy and Prudential Capital Group, various bond and cash reserves are required
to provide assurances that the power plants will have the necessary funds to
maintain expected operations and meet loan payment obligations. Restricted cash
balances and bond reserves are summarized as follows:  
  Current restricted cash and bond reserves  :   
 
 -13-  

Long-term restricted cash and bond reserves:   
 
 The well bonding requirements ensure that the Company has
sufficient financial resources to construct, operate and maintain geothermal
wells while safeguarding subsurface, surface and atmospheric resources from
unreasonable degradation, and to protect ground water aquifers and surface water
sources from contamination. Other future costs of environmental remediation
cannot be reasonably estimated and have not been recorded. The debt service
reserves are required to provide assurance that the Company will have sufficient
funds to meet its debt payment obligations for the terms specified by the loan
agreements. The maintenance and capital expenditure reserves are required by the
lending entities to ensure that funds are available to acquire and maintain
critical components of power plants and related supporting structures to enable
the plants to operate according to expectations. Except for the PPA Security
Bond, all of the restricted funds consisted of cash deposits or money market
accounts held in commercial banks. Portions of the cash deposits are subject to
FDIC insurance. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an
interconnection agreement with CAISO that required escrow deposits of $1,000,069
for funding costs at our WGP Geysers Project. In May 2016, the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary (Idaho USG Holdings LLC) entered in to a loan agreement
with Prudential Capital Group. The terms of the loan agreement required the
initial funding of three reserve accounts that totaled $6,454,205. The funding
requirements of the new loan are based upon the operations and financial
conditions of USG Oregon LLC and Raft River Energy I LLC. The PPA Security Bond
is held by the power purchaser. All of the reserve accounts were considered to
be fully funded at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 The Company s estimated effective income tax rate is as
follows:  
 
 -16-  

The provision for income taxes reflects an estimated effective
income tax rate attributable to U.S. Geothermal Inc. s share of income. Our
provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
reflects a reported effective tax rate of (0.0)% which differs from the
statutory federal income tax rate of 34% primarily due to the impact of the
non-controlling interest and state income taxes.  
  NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE   
   Prudential Capital Group   Idaho USG Holdings
LLC   In May 2016, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary (Idaho USG
Holdings LLC) entered into a loan agreement with the Prudential Capital Group to
finance the Company s development activities. The original principal totaled $20
million and included the option to issue additional debt up to $50 million
within the next two years. The original $20 million loan amount bears interest
at a fixed interest rate of 5.8% per annum. The principal and interest payments
are due semi-annually at amounts based upon a 20-year amortization period and
the scheduled remaining balance of $16,009,495 is due in full at the end of the
7 year term. The loan is secured by the Company s ownership interests in the
Neal Hot Springs (Oregon USG Holdings LLC and USG Oregon LLC) and the Raft River
(Raft River Energy I LLC) projects. At September 30, 2016, the balance of the
loan was $19,919,869 (current portion $618,640) and the net unamortized debt
issuance costs associated with this loan totaled $772,197 ($821,070, less
amortized costs of $48,873). 
   U.S. Department of Energy      On August
31, 2011, USG Oregon LLC ( USG Oregon ), a subsidiary of the Company, completed
the first funding drawdown associated with the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE )
$96.8 million loan guarantee ( Loan Guarantee ) to construct its power plant at
Neal Hot Springs in Eastern Oregon (the  Project ). All loan advances covered by
the Loan Guarantee have been made under the Future Advance Promissory Note (the
 Note ) dated February 23, 2011. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an
event of default under the transaction documents, all amounts payable under the
Note may e accelerated. In connection with the Loan Guarantee, the DOE has been
granted a security interest in all of the equity interests of USG Oregon, as
well as in the assets of USG Oregon, including a mortgage on real property
interests relating to the Project site. No additional advances are allowed under
the terms of the loan. A total of 13 draws were taken and each individual draw
or tranche is considered to be a separate loan. The loan principal is scheduled
to be paid over 21.5 years from the first scheduled payment date with
semi-annual installments including interest calculated at an aggregate fixed
interest rate of 2.598%. The principal payment amounts are calculated on a
straight-line basis according to the life of the loans and the original loan
principal amounts. The principal portion of the aggregate loan payment is
adjusted as individual tranches are extinguished. The principal payments started
at $1,709,963 on February 10, 2014 and are scheduled to be reduced to $1,499,259
on February 10, 2017 and continue through February 12, 2035. The loan balance at
September 30, 2016 totaled $60,171,274 (current portion $2,998,518).

   Prudential Capital Group   USG Nevada LLC   On
September 26, 2013, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary (USG Nevada LLC)
entered into a note purchase agreement with the Prudential Capital Group to
finance the Phase I San Emidio geothermal project located in northwest Nevada.
The term of the note is approximately 24 years, and bears interest at fixed rate
of 6.75% per annum. Interest payments are due quarterly. Principal payments are
due quarterly based upon minimum debt service coverage ratios established
according to projected operating results made at the loan origination date and
available cash balances. The loan agreement is secured by USG Nevada LLC s
right, title and interest in and to its real and personal property, including
the San Emidio project and the equity interests in USG Nevada LLC. At September
30, 2016, the balance of the loan was $29,353,782 (current portion
$644,405).

  NOTE 8 - STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   
 The Company has a stock incentive plan (the  Stock Incentive
Plan ) for the purpose of attracting and motivating directors, officers,
employees and consultants of the Company and advancing the interests of the
Company. The Stock Incentive Plan is a 15% rolling plan approved by shareholders
in September 2013, whereby the Company can grant options to the extent of 15% of
the current outstanding common shares. Under the plan, all forfeited and
exercised options can be replaced with new offerings. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company can issue stock option grants totaling up to 17,013,673 shares.
Options are typically granted for a term of up to five years from the date of
grant. Stock options granted generally vest over a period of eighteen months,
with 25% vesting on the date of grant and 25% vesting every six months
thereafter. The Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line
method of amortization. Historically, the Company has issued
new shares to satisfy exercises of stock options and the Company expects to
issue new shares to satisfy any future exercises of stock options.  
 -19-  

The following table reflects the summary of stock options
outstanding at January 1, 2016 and changes for the nine months ended September
30, 2016:  

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are
based on historical volatility of the Company s stock. The Company uses
historical data to estimate option volatility within the Black-Scholes model.
The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon past experience and future
estimates and includes data from the Plan. The risk-free rate for periods within
the expected term of the option is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. The Company currently does not foresee the payment
of dividends on common stock in the near term. 
 Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate and, therefore, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company s stock
options.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there was $338,321 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation
arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 40,000 options
priced between $0.48 and $0.74 with were forfeited due to termination of a
contractor and an employee.

  NOTE 9   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT   
 Current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). 
 The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows: 
 Level 1   Quoted prices are available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2   Directly or
indirectly market based inputs or observable inputs used in models or other
valuation methodologies.  Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are no
corroborated by market data. The inputs require significant management judgement
or estimation.  
 The following table discloses by level within the fair value
hierarchy the Company s assets and liabilities measured and reported on its
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at fair value on a recurring basis:

sheets of the Company are detailed as follows:  
 
   Gerlach Geothermal LLC      On April 28,
2008, the Company   formed Gerlach Geothermal, LLC ( Gerlach ) with our
partner,   Gerlach Green Energy, LLC ( GGE ). The purpose of the joint
venture is the exploration of the Gerlach geothermal system, which is located in
northwestern Nevada, near the town of Gerlach. Based upon the terms of the
members  agreement, the Company owned a 60% interest and GGE owned a 40%
interest in Gerlach Geothermal, LLC. The agreement gives GGE an option to
maintain its 40% ownership interest as additional capital contributions are
required. If GGE dilutes to below a 10% interest, their ownership position in
the joint venture would be converted to a 10% net profits interest. Initially,
the Company contributed $757,190 in cash and $300,000 for a geothermal lease and
mineral rights; and GGE has contributed $704,460 of geothermal lease, mineral
rights and exploration data. From November 18, 2014 through December 31, 2015,
the Company made additional contributions that totaled $496,000 to Gerlach that
were not proportionally matched by GGE. These contributions effectively reduced
GGE s ownership interest to 31.27%, and increased the Company s interest to
68.73% as of December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company made unmatched contributions of $15,000, which effectively increased
the Company s ownership interest to 68.93%.

assets and liabilities of Oregon Holdings and USG Oregon LLC, and report the
current non-controlling interest of Enbridge. The full results of Oregon
Holdings and USG Oregon LLC s operations are reflected in the statement of
operations with the elimination of the non-controlling interest identified. 
   Raft River Energy I LLC ( RREI )   Raft River
Energy I is a joint venture between the Company and Goldman Sachs. An Operating
Agreement governs the rights and responsibilities of both parties. At December
31, 2015, the Company had contributed approximately $17.9 million in cash and
property, and Goldman Sachs has contributed approximately $34.1 million in cash.
Profits and losses are allocated to the members based upon contractual terms.

energy credit sales and 1% of the residual income/loss excluding energy credit
sales. Under the terms of the amended agreement that became effective December
16, 2015, the Company will receive a 95% interest in RREI s cash flows. Under
the terms of both agreements, Goldman Sachs receives a greater proportion of the
share of profit or losses for income tax purposes/benefits. This includes the
allocation of profits and losses as well as production tax credits, which will
be distributed 99% to Goldman Sachs and 1% to the Company during the first 10
years of production, which ends December 31, 2017. During the nine months ended

  NOTE 12   ASSET RETIRMENT OBLIGATIONS   
   The Geysers, California   On April 22, 2014, the
Company completed the acquisition of a group of companies owned by Ram Power
Corp. s Geysers Project located in Northern California. Two of the acquired
companies (Western GeoPower, Inc. and Etoile Holdings, Inc.) contained asset
retirement obligations that, primarily, originate with the environmental
regulations defined by the laws of the State of California. The liabilities
related to the removal and disposal of arsenic impacted soil and existing
steam conveyance pipelines are estimated to total $598,930. Obligations related
to decommissioning four existing wells were estimated at $606,000. These
obligations are initially estimated based upon discounted cash flows estimates
and are accreted to full value over time. At September 30, 2016, the Company has
not considered it necessary to specifically fund these obligations. Since the
Company is still evaluating the development plan for this project that could
eliminate or significantly reduce the remaining obligations, no charges directly
associated the asset retirement obligations have been charged to operations. The
obligation balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 totaled
$1,204,930. All of the obligations were considered to be long-term.    
 -23-  

Raft River Energy I LLC, USG Nevada LLC, and USG Oregon
LLC     
 These Companies operate in Idaho, Nevada and Oregon and
are subject to environmental laws and regulations of these states. The plants,
wells, pipelines and transmission lines are expected to have long useful lives.
Generally, these assets will require funds for retirement or reclamation.
However, these estimated obligations are believed to be less than or not
significantly more than the assets  estimated salvage values. Therefore, as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no retirement obligations have been
recognized. 
  NOTE 13   BUSINESS SEGMENTS  
 The Company has two reportable segments: Operating Plants, and
Corporate and Development. These segments are managed and reported separately
due to dissimilar economic characteristics. Operating plants are engaged in the
sale of electricity from the power plants pursuant to long-tern PPAs. Corporate
and development costs are intended to produce additional revenue generating
projects. A summary of financial information concerning the Company s reportable
segments is shown in the following table:

NOTE 14   SUBSEQUENT EVENT  
 The Company has evaluated events and transactions that have
occurred after the balance sheet date through November 9, 2016, which is
considered to be the issuance date. The following event was identified for
disclosure:  
   Share Consolidation (Reverse Stock Split)    
   On September 30, 2016, the Company s stockholders granted authority
to the Board of Directors to effect a share consolidation of the common stock at
an exchange ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not greater than 1-for-6. The
Board of Directors has approved the 1-for-6 share consolidation to be effective
upon the filing and effectiveness of a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s
Certificate of Incorporation after the market close on November 9, 2016. Upon
effectiveness of the 1-for-6 share consolidation, each 6 shares of issued and
outstanding common stock will be converted into one newly issued and outstanding
share of common stock. Proportional adjustments will also be made to all shares
of common stock issuable under the Company s stock incentive plans and common
stock purchase warrants. Share and share amounts included in the interim
financial statements have not been restated to reflect the 1-for-6 share
consolidation. The pro forma share and per share information as of and for the
three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, giving effect
to the 1-for-6 share consolidation is presented as follows:

    General Background and Discussion    
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and notes thereto included in this quarterly report and our
Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March
10, 2016.  
 U.S. Geothermal Inc. ( the Company ) is a Delaware corporation.
The Company s common stock trades on the NYSE MKT LLC under the trade symbol
 HTM . 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company was
focused on: 
 
   operating and optimizing the Neal Hot Springs, San Emidio and Raft River
  power plants;
   conducting annual maintenance outages at all three projects;
   drilling and flow testing two wells at San Emidio II;
   permitting the deepening of three additional temperature gradient wells at
  San Emidio II;
   continuing to optimize and engineer the power plant/hybrid cooling design,
  working on obtaining the Conditional Use Permit, and pursuing PPA
  opportunities for the WGP Geysers project;
   flow testing a well at El Ceibillo;
   drilling a second leg on a production well at Raft River
   preparing for water well drilling at Neal Hot Springs; and
   evaluating potential new geothermal projects and acquisition
  opportunities.   
  Project Overview   
 The following is a list of projects that are in operation,
under development or under exploration. Projects in operation currently have
producing geothermal power plants. Projects under development have a geothermal
resource discovery or may have wells in place, but require the drilling of new
or additional production and injection wells in order to supply enough
geothermal fluid sufficient to operate a commercial power plant. Projects under
exploration do not have a geothermal resource discovery occurrence yet, but have
significant thermal and other physical evidence that warrants the expenditure of
capital in search of the discovery of a geothermal resource.
Due to inflation and marketplace increases in the costs of labor and
construction materials, estimates provided for project development costs could
understate actual costs.

       The Company s equity interest in the project is 60% and
      Enbridge s equity interest is 40%.   
   
     (2)  
     
       In December 2015, the Company purchased 45% of the Raft
      River Energy I LLC membership interest from Goldman Sachs Group, bringing
      the Company s membership interest in the project to 95%. Goldman retains a
      5% membership interest.   
   
     (3)  
     
       The annual average net output design for the plant is 13
      megawatts. The output of the Raft River Unit I plant currently is
      approximately 9.4 megawatts annual average.    
  Neal Hot Springs, Oregon   Neal Hot Springs is located
in Eastern Oregon near the town of Vale, the county seat of Malheur County, and
achieved commercial operation on November 16, 2012. The Neal Hot Springs
facility is designed as a 22 megawatt net annual average power plant, consisting
of three separate 12.2 megawatt (gross) modules, with each module having a
design output of 7.33 megawatts (net) annual average based on a specific flow
and temperature of geothermal brine.  
 For the third quarter of 2016, generation was 29,758
megawatt-hours with an average of 13.5 net megawatts per hour of operation and
plant availability was 99.5%. For the same period in 2015, the plant generated
33,497 megawatt-hours with an average of 15.4 net megawatts per hour and plant
availability was 98.5%. Generation for the first three quarters of 2016 was
122,523 megawatt-hours (124,229 megawatt-hours for the first three quarters of
2015). The facility took a planned 21 hour outage during September to perform
function testing of the substation protective relays and switches. Unit 3 s
annual outage was also taken in September and was off line for 252 hours (10.5
days). The pump in production well NHS-8 was replaced during the outage.  
 Approval for the fresh water drilling program by our project
lender (the U.S. Department of Energy) was received in mid-September. Drilling
contracts are being executed and it is expected that drilling will commence in
the 4 th  quarter 2016. An initial study of various hybrid cooling
methods was completed by third party experts which confirms a strong economic
return for hybrid cooling if enough water can be found. 
 The PPA for the project was signed on December 11, 2009 with
the Idaho Power Company. It has a 25-year term, and a variable percentage annual
price escalation. The PPA has a seasonal pricing structure that pays 120% of the
average price for four months (July, August, November, December), 100% of the
average price for five months (January, February, June, September, October) and
73.3% of the average price for three months (March, April, May). The annual
average price paid under the PPA for 2016 is $109.27 ($106.79 for 2015) per
megawatt-hour.  
  San Emidio Unit I, Nevada   The Unit I power plant at
San Emidio is located approximately 100 miles north-east of Reno, Nevada near
the town of Gerlach, and achieved commercial operation on May 25, 2012. The San
Emidio facility is a single 14.7 megawatt (gross) module, with a design output
of 9 megawatts (net) annual average based on a specific flow and temperature of
geothermal brine.

For the third quarter of 2016, generation was 19,675
megawatt-hours with an average of 9.0 net megawatts per hour of operation and
plant availability was 99.2%. For the same period in 2015, the plant generated
18,924 megawatt-hours with an average of 8.7 net megawatts per hour and plant
availability was 98.9%. Generation for the first three quarters of 2016 was
54,247 megawatt-hours (59,170 megawatt-hours for the first three quarters of
2015). 
 On June 1, 2011, an amended and restated PPA was signed with
Sierra Pacific Power Company d/b/a NV Energy for the sale of up to 19.9
megawatts of electricity on an annual average basis from two units. The option
for the second unit expired in December 2015. The PPA has a 25-year term with a
base price of $89.75 per megawatt-hour, and an annual escalation rate of 1
percent. The annual average price paid under the PPA for 2016 is $93.01 ($92.08
for 2015) per megawatt-hour.  
  Raft River, Idaho   Raft River Energy I ( RREI ) is
located in Southern Idaho, near the town of Malta, and achieved commercial
operation on January 3, 2008. The Raft River facility is a single 18 megawatt
(gross) module, with a design output of 13 megawatts (net) annual average based
on a specific flow and temperature of geothermal brine. 
 For the third quarter of 2016, generation was 16,622
megawatt-hours with an average of 7.5 net megawatts per hour of operation and
plant availability was 100%. For the same period in 2015, the plant generated
15,950 megawatt-hours with an average of 8.7 net megawatt hours and plant
availability was 82.7%. Generation for the first three quarters of 2016 was
51,953 megawatt-hours (53,845 megawatt-hours for the first three quarters of
2015). On September 27, 2016 the pump in well RRG-1 failed and was replaced at
the end of October 2016.  
 The lower year over year production is primarily due to the
failure of production pump RRG-2 on February 9, 2016. The well remained out of
service until the planned drilling of a second production leg began on June 13,
2016 and was completed on July 29, 2016   to a depth of 5,605 feet.
Several small zones of permeability were encountered in the new production leg.
After testing the well, a new pump was installed and the well resumed production
on September 6, 2016. The well continues to heat up and is on track to reach its
normal production temperature of 283 F before the end of November. To date,
there has not been an increase in flow from the well. 
 A second option is also under consideration to increase fluid
flow to the plant. Well RRG-5, an idle injection well with significant
permeability, is being tested and evaluated for conversion to production A
temperature survey has been completed and reservoir modeling is in progress to
evaluate the impact of producing this well. 
 The PPA for the project was signed on September 24, 2007 with
the Idaho Power Company and allows for the sale of up to 13 megawatts of
electricity on an annual average basis. The PPA has a 25 year term with a
starting average price for the year 2007 of $52.50 that escalates at 2.1% per
year through 2020 and then at 0.6% per year until the end of the contract in
2034. The Idaho Power PPA has a seasonal pricing structure that pays 120% of the
average price for four months (July, August, November, December), 100% of the
average price for five months (January, February, June, September, October) and
73.5% of the average price for three months (March, April, May). The annual
average price paid under the PPA for 2016 is $63.30 ($62.00 for 2015) per
megawatt-hour.  
 In addition to the price paid for energy by Idaho Power, RREI
currently receives $4.75 per megawatt-hour under a separate contract for the
sale of Renewable Energy Credits ( RECs ) to Holy Cross Energy, a Colorado
electric cooperative. Starting in calendar year 2018, 49% of the RECs produced
will be owned by RREI and 51% will be owned by the Idaho Power Company. For the
49% of RECs owned by RREI, a 10 year REC contract with the Public Utility
District No. 1 of Clallam County, Washington will replace the current contract.
The Company currently receives 95% of the REC income during the remaining term
of the Holy Cross contract and will receive 95% of the REC
income due to RREI during the term of the Clallam County contract.

WGP Geysers, California   The WGP Geysers project is
located in the broader Geysers geothermal field located approximately 75 miles
north of San Francisco, California. The broader Geysers geothermal field is the
largest producing geothermal field in the world generating more than 850
megawatts of power for more than 30 years. Acquisition of the WGP Geysers
Project from Ram Power was completed on April 22, 2014 for $6.4 million. We
expect that approximately 75% of the development may be funded by non-recourse
project debt, with the remainder funded through equity financing. We anticipate
the project qualifying for the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit, which when
monetized can meet most of the equity financing requirements. 
 We received the signed Large Generator Interconnection
Agreement for the project on March 6, 2016 with the California Independent
System Operator and Pacific Gas   Electric (PG E). This agreement allows
the project to connect to the transmission grid and deliver up to 35 megawatts
of energy. The Company has paid the total interconnection cost of $1.9 million
for the grid operator s portion of the work in the substation. An additional 1.7
mile long transmission line will be required to connect from the plant to the
substation. PG E will undertake engineering studies to determine the cost
for the line.  
 Engineering optimization of the power plant design is
continuing, with a focus on the new hybrid plant design that includes both water
and air cooling, and in reducing construction costs. This design will
dramatically increase the volume of water available for injection back into the
reservoir. Traditional water cooled geothermal steam plants re-inject
approximately 20 to 25% of the water that is extracted from the ground for power
generation, while a hybrid design may re-inject 65% or more of the water. This
higher injection rate will provide longer term, stable steam production, and
will result in increased power generation over the life of the project. Approval
of the new conditional use permit from Sonoma County is expected during the
fourth quarter of 2016.  
 Based on flow test data generated from well flow testing
performed in mid-2015, a third party expert reported in September 2015, that the
four production wells already drilled are capable of delivering an initial
capacity of 28.1 MW (gross) or 25.4 MW (net) based on current power plant steam
conversion rates from a detailed design for a 28.8 MW (net) power plant. These
tests show the wells would initially produce a combined total of 458,000 pounds
per hour. Using the average steam production rate from these wells and an
assumed interference factor of 30%, the third party expert estimates that an
additional two to three production wells would be needed to support the long
term operation of a 28.8 MW (net) plant. 
 Two methods were used to estimate the long-term capacity of the
WGP project, and both support a high probability that a 28.8 MW (net) plant can
be operated for 25 years, given the modern plant design and the available
productive area. The first method is an established natural gas reservoir
engineering calculation that is routinely used at The Geysers, which estimated
that the reservoir could support the 28.8 MW (net) plant for up to 54 years
using hybrid cooling as the basis. The second method is an empirical approach
based on a third party expert s extensive experience at The Geysers, and uses
the estimated steam production capacity per acre within the productive area of
the geothermal leasehold. On this basis, the productive acreage within the WGP
leasehold has steam reserves sufficient to supply up to 44 MW (net) with a
conventional injection level of 25%, and potentially more at the higher
injection levels associated with the planned hybrid cooling system.  
 Discussions with numerous potential off-takers for the power
from our power plant continue, with interest expressed by a number of them for
base load, renewable power to replace fossil fuel based power generation that is
being phased out of their portfolios. We responded to one Request For Proposal
(RFP) early in the year, but were not selected. RFPs from other potential
off-takers are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2016.

El Ceibillo, Republic of Guatemala   A geothermal
energy rights concession, located 14 kilometers southwest of Guatemala City, was
awarded to U.S. Geothermal Guatemala S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company in April 2010. The concession has a five year term for the development
and construction of a power plant. There are 24,710 acres (100 square
kilometers) in the concession, which is at the center of the Aqua and Pacaya
twin volcano complex.  
 Production well EC-5 was completed to a depth of 1,450 feet
(442 meters) on August 20th and intersected a high permeability zone at 1,299
feet (396 meters). EC-5 underwent a series of flow tests, with field wide
monitoring, beginning on September 5th and ran until September 13th. Data was
collected from three monitoring wells during the test (EC-2A, EC-3, and EC-4) to
provide pressure data for the reservoir model. Flow test data was transmitted to
our consulting reservoir engineer who is constructing a reservoir model and
developing a first estimate of power generation potential for the shallow El
Ceibillo reservoir. Fluid samples taken at the end of the flow test indicate a
potential reservoir temperature of 450 to 523 F (232 to 273 C). 
 Planning is underway for a deep slim hole to test the producing
structure down dip from well EC-5 to a projected depth of 1,970 to 2,300 feet
(600-800 meters). A deeper intersection in the reservoir could increase the
production temperature of the reservoir and change the design of the power
plant. Well EC-1, which was drilled in 2013 to a depth of 5,650 feet (1,722
meters) found a measured bottom-hole temperature of 526 F (274 C), but no
permeability. The comparative geology from EC-5 and EC-1 suggests a fault or
other structure may be located in the area between the two wells.  
 With the concession agreement modified in 2015 to reflect the
updated development schedule, discussions are being reestablished with potential
buyers for the output from the plant. Additionally, the Guatemalan government,
through the National Electrical Energy Commission  ( COMISI N NACIONAL DE
ENERG A EL CTRICA  CNEE ) ,  has announced that it is preparing to issue an
RFP for renewable energy later this year. CNEE has retained a large U.S. based
consulting firm, to prepare the RFP. 
  San Emidio Phase II, Nevada   The Phase II expansion
is dependent on successful development of additional production and injection
well capacity. We expect that approximately 75% of the Phase II development may
be funded by non-recourse project debt, with the remainder funded through equity
financing. We anticipate the project qualifying for the 30% Federal Investment
Tax Credit, which when monetized, can meet most of the equity financing
requirements. 
 In July 2016, two of the most prospective wells were deepened
and both intersected high permeability with high temperatures. Well 17-21
intersected the geothermal resource at 1,766 feet deep and well 25-21
intersected geothermal resource at 2,206 feet deep. During September and early
October 2016, both wells were flow tested individually for three days. Well
17-21 produced a stabilized, artesian flow of 452 gpm at a flowing temperature
of 323 F. Well 25-21 produced a stabilized, artesian flow of 467 gpm at a
flowing temperature of 324 F. These temperatures are 44 degrees higher than the
currently producing San Emidio Phase I wellfield. During the tests, pressure
monitoring between the two wells and across the currently producing wellfield,
showed very low pressure response, which indicates that production from the
Southwest Zone would not adversely impact the existing facility.  
 These two new wells are approximately 1,700 feet apart along
the new structural trend identified in the Southwest Zone, which is still open
for expansion. Temperature gradient well data and seismic information indicate a
potential strike length for the Southwest Zone of up to 2,700 feet. This
compares to a strike length for the primary producing wellfield at San Emidio
Phase I of 800 feet, suggesting a much larger resource in this Southwest Zone.
 
 -32-  

Permits to deepen the remaining three temperature gradient
wells were submitted to the Bureau of Land Management on August 30, 2016. Once
the permits are received, these three wells will be deepened to the targeted
depth to further explore the Southwest Zone. If successful, it will extend the
length of the productive reservoir by 1,000 feet. 
 In July 2016, the Company was awarded a $1.5 million Department
of Energy cost share grant under the  Development of Technologies for Sensing,
Analyzing, and Utilizing Novel Subsurface Signals in Support of the Subsurface
Technology and Engineering ( SubTER ) Crosscut Initiative . The program approved
under the grant includes using new subsurface technologies at both San Emidio
and Crescent Valley to identify fluid flow paths in the geothermal resource. If
the subsurface testing is successful, a second phase to confirm its findings
with drilling will be undertaken. The total program cost is $1.9 million with
the Company providing $400,000 in cost share. 
 The final stage study of the interconnection process, the
Facilities Study, was started by NV Energy in February 2016, and was completed
during the second quarter of 2016. A draft interconnection agreement was
received on June 30, 2016 and is expected to be executed during the fourth
quarter of 2016. We currently have 16 megawatts of transmission capacity and are
asking for an additional 3.9 megawatts to cover the Phase II plant requirements
for transmission.  
  Raft River, Idaho   In 2011, the Raft River Phase II
project was awarded an $11.4 million cost-shared, thermal stimulation program
grant from the Department of Energy with the University of Utah Energy And
Geoscience Institute as the project lead. The goal of the project is to create
an Enhanced Geothermal System ( EGS ) by creating thermal fractures and
developing a corresponding increase in permeability in the low permeability
rock. Well RRG-9 was made available for the program and the first stage of
injection into the well began in June 2013. 
 Initially the well was only capable of receiving 20 gallons per
minute ( gpm ) of water due to the low permeability of the rock. After several
moderate pressure stimulations, the injection of cold power plant discharge
fluid was started and has continued through the second quarter. The lower
temperature fluid causes thermal fracturing within the higher temperature host
rock of the reservoir. At the current plant generation level, the flow into the
well has continued to increase and is now approximately 1,060 gpm.  
 Well RRG-9 continues to be used temporarily as an injection
well as an extension of the DOE EGS program, which is expected at this time to
continue through 2016. The Company s contributions for the thermal stimulation
program are made in-kind by the use of the RRG-9 well, well field data provided
by the Company, and through ongoing monitoring support.  
  Crescent Valley, Nevada   The Crescent Valley prospect
consists of approximately 21,300 acres (33.3 square miles) of private and
Federal geothermal leases. It is located in Eureka County, Nevada, approximately
15 miles south of the Beowawe geothermal power plant and about 33 miles
southeast of Battle Mountain. The project was acquired as part of the Earth
Power Resources merger which was completed in November 2014.  
 In light of federal legislation that extended the qualification
for the 30% Investment Tax Credit to projects that began construction prior to
December 31, 2014, drilling of the first production/injection well CVP-001
(67-3) was initiated in December of 2014, following completion of gravity
surveys, and analysis of prior temperature gradient drilling data. Well CVP-001
was completed on March 27, 2015 to a depth of 2,746 feet. The well exhibited
modest permeability with a flowing temperature of 213 F, which makes the well
suited for duty as an injection well. The next phase of development work is in
the planning stages and is currently on hold due to market conditions.

This project is expected to benefit from the Department of
Energy cost share grant awarded in July 2016. The details of this award are
discussed in the San Emidio Phase II project discussion above. 
    Operating Results    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company

  San Emidio, Nevada Plant Energy Sales and Plant Operating
Expenses (USG Nevada LLC)  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the San Emidio
plant reported subsidiary net income of $667,192 which was a decrease of
$539,552 (44.7% decrease) from $1,206,744 subsidiary net income reported in the
same period ended 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the San
Emidio plant reported subsidiary net income of $384,018 which was a decrease of
$2,015 (0.5% decrease) from $386,033 subsidiary net income reported in the same
period ended 2015.

Energy sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
decreased 7.4% (5.0% increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016)
from the same periods ended 2015. During the current nine months, the plant
produced 54,247 megawatt hours (19,675 megawatt hours in the current three
months), which was a 8.32% decrease (3.97% increase for the current three
months) from the same periods ended 2015. The production variances were
primarily due to the outages needed to replace a refrigerant pump. In the second
quarter, the plant lost 304 production hours caused by the failure of a
vaporizer bypass valve and refrigerant pump. Efficiencies gained by the new
refrigerant pump have increased production that was realized in the current
third quarter.  
 Plant operating costs, excluding depreciation, increased
$95,106 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ($13,730 increase for the
three months ended September 30, 2016), which was a 5.2% increase (2.2% increase
for the three months ended September 30, 2016) from the same periods ended 2015.
Increases in field maintenance and taxes were partially offset by decreases in
corporate and administrative costs. In the current quarter, refrigerant pump and
related repair costs were incurred that exceeded $66,400. Also, the Company
incurred costs of $19,825 for generator compliance testing costs required by the
Western Electric Coordination Council. 
 For the current nine months, taxes, licenses and permit costs
increased $94,896 ($9,159 increase for the current three months), which was a
347.8% increase (319.7% increase for the current three months) from the same
periods ended in 2015. The mineral proceeds tax for the State of Nevada were
significantly lower in 2015 due to an overpayment in 2014 and lower budgeted
allowable expenses for 2015. In the second quarter 2016 an additional minerals
proceeds tax assessment was made for $30,425 after an examination by the State
of Nevada. 
 Corporate and administrative costs decreased primarily due to
reduction in management fees. Effective November 2015, the Company discontinued
the management fees that it charged to the plant. Management fees of $206,398
were charged to the plant for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

30, 2016) from the same periods ended 2015. Unplanned production losses were
experienced in March 2016 and August 2015. In March 2016, the plant lost one of
its production wells partially due to the drilling of the new leg on a
production well. In June and August 2015, the plant lost 371 hours during two
unplanned outages needed for turbine repairs. 
 Plant operating costs, excluding depreciation, decreased
$716,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ($322,088 decrease for the

decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016) from the same periods
ended 2015. The decrease in plant operating costs for the nine month period were
primarily due to the turbine repair costs incurred in the second and third
quarters prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the turbine
repairs exceeded $361,500 ($194,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015).

increased $129,183 ($49,928 increase for the three months ended September 30,
2016) from the same periods ended 2015. For the current nine months, additional
rental/storage costs of $129,948 ($50,693 in current quarter 2016) were
primarily incurred for storage of power plant components acquired in the fourth
quarter 2015.  
  Professional and Management Fees   For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported $1,380,649 in professional and
management fees which was an increase of $561,952 (68.6% increase) from $818,697

the Board of Directors to thoroughly explore strategic options to maximize
shareholder value. The Company ended this process and ended the contract with
the primary consultant that was engaged in the examination in March 2016. For
the first quarter 2016, the consultant s fees associated with this examination
totaled approximately $544,000. The Company incurred fees of $100,000 for
services provided by a new financial advisor hired during the first quarter
2016. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred consulting

Net Income Tax Expense 
 For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company reported $297,000 in income tax benefit which
was a favorable decrease of $770,000 (162.8% decrease) from $473,000 income tax
expense reported in the same period ended 2015. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company reported net income tax benefit of $91,000,
which was a favorable decrease of $261,000 (153.3% decrease) from the income tax
expense of $170,000 reported in the same period ended 2015. The variance was a
function of lower income attributed to the Company primarily due to higher
professional fees, corporate administrative costs, and travel and promotion
costs noted above.  
  Net Income Attributable to the Non-Controlling
Interests  The net income attributable to the non-controlling interest
entities is the line item that removes the portion of the total consolidated
operations that are owned by the Company s subsidiaries. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported $1,560,181 in net income
attributable to non-controlling interests, which was an increase of $531,247
(51.6% increase) from $1,028,934 net income reported in the same period ended
2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported
$418,728 in net income attributable to non-controlling interests, which was an
increase of $104,513 (33.3% increase) from $314,215 net income reported in the
same period ended 2015. The primary component of the variances were the
operating results of Raft River Energy I LLC ( RREI ) which reported a
subsidiary net loss for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 of
$499,452 and $19,060; respectively. The losses decreased for the nine months and
three months ended September 30, 2016 by $562,985 (53.0% loss decrease) and
$277,683 (93.6% loss decrease); respectively. RREI s profits and losses are
allocated based upon the terms of the partnership agreement. The primary
conditions for the decreases in RREI s losses were discussed above.  
 The net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling
interest entities is detailed as follows:  
 
  %   - represents the percentage
of change from 2015 to 2016 .    #  - Variance percentage was
extremely high or undefined.

  Non-Controlling Interestsx  The following is a
summarized presentation of select financial line items from the statement of
operations by project and the impact of the related non-controlling interests
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

(1)  
     
       The non-controlling interest for Neal Hot Springs
      represent a 40% interest for our joint venture partner,
Enbridge.   
   
     (2)  
     
       The non-controlling interest for Raft River represents 5%
      of REC income and cash flows, and 99% of all remaining profits and losses
      allocated to the Goldman Sachs Group.   
   
     (3)  
     
       The non-controlling interest for our exploration
      activities represents an approximately 33% interest for our joint venture
      partner at Gerlach, GGE Development.   
   
     (4)  
     
       Major costs included in Exploration Activities and
      Corporate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
  included:     
 
 These costs are the responsibility of
U.S. Geothermal Inc. (the Parent Company) and cannot be allocated to projects.
Once a project has been classified as developmental, the costs associated with a
project will be capitalized.  
 -43-  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not have any off
balance sheet arrangements.    
    Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the operating
projects of U.S. Geothermal continued to generate significant available cash
(after debt service and reserves) to fund our development activities and
corporate costs. In addition, exercise of options and warrants generated
$185,906 during the quarter. We believe our cash and liquid investments at
September 31, 2016 are adequate to fund our general operating activities through
December 31, 2017. 
 Development of our projects under development and under
exploration may require additional funding. In addition to government loans and
grants discussed below, we anticipate that additional funding may be raised
through financial and strategic partnerships, market loans, issuance of debt or
equity, and/or through the sale of ownership interest in tax credits and
benefits. The Company continues discussions with potential investors to evaluate
alternatives for funding at the corporate and project levels.  
 Idaho Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power (NV Energy),
continue to pay for their power in a timely manner. This power is sold under
long-term contracts at fixed prices. The status of the credit and equity markets
could delay our project development activities while we seek to obtain economic
credit terms or a favorable equity market price to further the drilling and
construction activities. 
 On May 19, 2016, the Company closed on a $20 million debt
facility from Prudential Capital Group. Under terms of the financing agreement,
the Company has the option, without obligation, to issue additional debt, up to
$50 million in aggregate within the next two years. The initial $20 million loan
has a fixed interest rate of 5.8% per annum. The loan principal amortizes over
twenty years, with a seven-year term. Principal and interest payments are made
semi-annually. The loan is collateralized with the Company s ownership interest
in the Neal Hot Springs and Raft River projects and by virtue of a pledge by the
Company s wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Geothermal Inc., an Idaho corporation,
and sole member of Idaho USG Holdings, the equity interests in Idaho USG
Holdings. The 22 MW Neal Hot Springs project is owned 60% by the Company and 40%
by Enbridge. The 13 MW Raft River project is owned 95% by the Company and 5% by
Goldman Sachs.  
 On January 25, 2016, management determined it would be prudent
to enter into a new Lincoln Park Capital ( LPC ) facility. The Company s first
Purchase Agreement with LPC, was entered into on May 21, 2012 and expired in
2015. Under the new Purchase Agreement, at the company s sole discretion, the
Company has the right to sell and LPC has the obligation to purchase up to $10
million of equity capital over a 30-month period subject to the conditions in
the Purchase Agreement. The agreement provides for an initial sale of $650,000
of shares of common stock upon closing. Net proceeds from LPC s investments will
be used to cover a portion of the cost of the recent acquisition of the Goldman
Sachs ownership interest of the Raft River project, development of our
geothermal projects and for general corporate purposes. During the quarter ended
March 31, 2016 an additional $571,650 was raised under the At the Market ( ATM )
subsequent to the initial sale. No additional funds were raised over the last
two quarters.  
 On December 14, 2015, the Company acquired from Goldman Sachs
the majority of their cash flow interest in and ownership of the Raft River
geothermal project. The Company will receive 95% of the cash flow from the
project on a going forward basis, along with all increased cash flow from any
project improvements. Allocations of profits and losses will remain 99% to
Goldman Sachs and 1% to the Company until December 31, 2017, after which the
Company will receive 95% of the allocation of profits and losses and Goldman
Sachs will receive 5%. The purchase price was $5.1 million for the 95% interest, with an option to purchase the balance of Goldman s
interest for Fair Market Value at the end of 2017. The purchase price consisted
of a $3.5 million cash payment plus a promissory note of $1.6 million that bears
interest at 8%. Under the promissory note agreement, $1 million of the note
could be satisfied with shares of U.S. Geothermal common stock priced at the 10
day weighted average closing price of the common stock at time of conversion if
not otherwise paid in cash by March 31, 2016. Since the Company paid off this
note in cash on March 31, 2016, the Company has now withdrawn its resale
registration statement covering the shares to be issued in satisfaction of the
promissory note.  
 -44-  

Potential Acquisitions    
 The Company intends to continue its growth through the
acquisition of ownership or leasehold interests in properties and/or property
rights that it believes will add to the value of the Company s geothermal
resources, and through possible mergers with or acquisitions of operating power
plants and geothermal or other renewable energy properties. 
    Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and
estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures.
We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience,
current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time our
consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review
the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our
consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined
with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates,
and such differences could be material. 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical
accounting estimates as discussed in our Annual Report.

controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered
by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including
the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the end of this period covered by this quarterly report to ensure
that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms relating to us, including our consolidated

a.  
     
       all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
