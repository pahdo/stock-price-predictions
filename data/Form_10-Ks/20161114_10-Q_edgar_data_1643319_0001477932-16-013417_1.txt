ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY       Organization      Sleepaid Holding Co. ( Sleepaid ) and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively and on a consolidated basis as the  Company  or  we ,  us  or  our  or similar terminology.     Sleepaid, a Nevada Corporation, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 17, 2014. Yugosu Investment Limited ( Yugosu ) was incorporated in Hong Kong on March 28, 2007 and established a fiscal year end of December 31.     Guangzhou Smartfame Co., Ltd ( Guangzhou Smartfame ), the wholly owned subsidiary of the Yugosu, was incorporated under the laws of the PRC in Guangzhou, as a limited company on June 25, 2013. On May 11, 2016, Guangzhou Smartfame changed the name to Guangzhou Sleepaid Household Supplies Co., Ltd. ( Sleepaid Household ) and expanded the business activities to including the wholesale and manufacturing of household supplies and furniture.     Yuewin Trading Ltd ( Yuewin ), the wholly owned subsidiary of Sleepaid Household, was incorporated under the laws of the PRC as a limited company on March 24, 2008.      The Company and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the  Group ) are engaged in operating mattress and bedroom products retail outlets.       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       (a)   Method of Accounting      The Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method accounting for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the presentation of consolidated financial statements.      (b)   Principles of consolidation      The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.     The following table depicts the identity of the subsidiary:                   Note:    (1)  Wholly owned subsidiary of Sleepaid Holding Company         (2)    Wholly owned subsidiary of Yugosu Investment Limited          (3)   Wholly owned subsidiary of Sleepaid Household                     7       
      Table of Contents           SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (c)   Use of estimates      The preparation of consolidated financial statements that conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time, however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.      (d)   Economic and   p  olitical   r  isks      The Company s operations are conducted in Hong Kong and China and a large number of customers are located in Southern China. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in Hong Kong and China, and by the general state of the economy in Hong Kong and China.      The Company s operations and customers in Hong Kong and Southern China are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments, and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in Hong Kong and China, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.      (e)   Property, p  lant and   e  quipment      Plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method with 5% scrape value.      Estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:             Furniture and fixtures     4 years      Office equipment    3 - 5 years      Motor vehicles    4 years         The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operation.                  8

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (f)   Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets       The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances warrant such a review, pursuant to the guidelines established in ASC No. 360. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost to dispose.      During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.      (g)   Cash and concentration of risk      The Group considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Group maintains bank accounts in HK and the PRC.      (h)   Income taxes      The Company accounts for income tax using an asset and liability approach and allows for recognition of deferred tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future realization is uncertain.      (i)   Foreign currency translation      The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars (USD). The functional currencies of the Company s operating business based in Hong Kong and PRC are the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and Renminbi (RMB) respectively. The consolidated financial statements are translated into USD from HKD and RMB at period-end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred..      The exchange rates used to translate amounts in HK$ and RMB into USD for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows:                        9       
      Table of Contents           SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (i)   Foreign currency translation   (  continued)      The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into USD at the rates used in translation. In addition, the current foreign exchange control policies applicable in PRC also restrict the transfer of assets or dividends outside the PRC.      (j)   Comprehensive income      Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income are required to be reported in a financial statement that is presented with the same prominence as other consolidated financial statements. The Company s current component of comprehensive income is the net income and foreign currency translation adjustment.      (k)   Recently implemented standards      The FASB has issued No. 2016-07  Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,  which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted.     The FASB has issued No. 2016-08  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  which requires the entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or the service before it is transferred to the customer. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year.             SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (k)   Recently implemented standards   (  continued)      The FASB has issued No. 2016-09  Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which aims to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The amendments in this Update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.     The FASB has issued No. 2016-10  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this Update clarify that contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, require an entity to transfer control of additional goods or services to a customer (for example, by requiring the entity to transfer control of additional rights to use or rights to access intellectual property that the customer does not already control) should be distinguished from contractual provisions that, explicitly or implicitly, define the attributes of a single promised license (for example, restrictions of time, geographical region, or use). The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective.     The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. This ASU rescinds SEC paragraphs pursuant to two SEC Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) meeting.     The FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments do not change the core revenue recognition principle in Topic 606. The amendments provide clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients. These amendments are effective at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year entity). Topic 606 is effective for nonpublic entities one year later. Following is a summary of the clarifying guidance and practical expedients in the amendments.     Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.            SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (l)   Account receivable      The Company is operating retail outlet stores in a cash or credit environment which rent space from various shopping malls controlling by the shopping mall owners. All customers pay for their purchases at the cashier counters operating by the owners. Upon confirmation of the transaction by the shopping mall, the shopping mall deducts the sales tax due to the government, the sales portion due to the shopping mall and remits the balance to the Company. It typically takes the shopping mall approximately 30 to 45 days to confirm the transaction, and settles net proceeds within the next 45 days. The Company s accounts receivable are the receivables due from the shopping malls for the sale of the products for which the shopping mall owner collected the payments from the customers and are holding to remit to the Company.     Accounts receivable is recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, significant one-time events and historical experience. Management reviews and adjusts this allowance periodically based on historical experience and its evaluation of the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable. The Company evaluates the credit risk of its customers utilizing historical data and estimates of future performance. Bad debts are written off as incurred. During the reporting years, there were no bad debts occurred.     Outstanding accounts balances are reviewed individually for collectability. The Company does not charge any interest income on trade receivables. Accounts balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. To date, the Company has not charged off any balances as it has yet to exhaust all means of collection.      (m)   Inventories      Inventories primarily consist of merchandise inventories and are stated at lower of cost or market and net realizable value. Cost of inventories is calculated on the weighted average basis which approximates cost.     Management regularly reviews inventories and records valuation reserves for damaged and defective returns, inventories with slow-moving or obsolescence exposure and inventories with carrying value that exceeds market value. Because of its product mix, the Company has not historically experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence.     Inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of revenues based on historical inventory shrinkage trends. The Company performs physical inventory count of its stores once per quarter and cycle counts inventories at its distribution centers once per quarter throughout the year. The reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each store since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date.     These reserves are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual results if future economic conditions, consumer demand and competitive environments differ from expectations.            SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    (CONTINUED)       (n)   Revenue recognition      The Company earns revenue by selling merchandise through self-managed retail stores inside shopping malls, franchise stores, wholesale agent and e-commerce service provider.      Revenue from self-managed retail stores inside shopping malls is recognized when merchandise is purchased by and delivered to the customer, confirmed, fixed and reconciled with the shopping malls and collectability is reasonably assured.      Revenue from franchised stores is recognized after goods delivered and cash collected (normally cash on delivery) from the franchise retail stores.     Revenue from wholesale agent is recognized after goods delivered, amount fixed or determined and collectability is reasonably assured.     Revenue from sales via e-commerce service provider is recognized after goods delivered, amount fixed or determined and collectability is reasonably assured.     All revenues are shown net of estimated returns during the relevant period represented by estimated allowance for sales returns based upon historical experience.      The Company records sales tax collected from its customers on a net basis, and therefore excludes it from revenue as defined in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.      (o)   Cost of sales      Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise, collecting and handling charges based on store sales deducted by landlord, related cost of packaging and shipping cost and the distribution center costs.      (p)   Operating lease rental      The Company did not have a lease that met the criteria of a capital lease. Leases that do not qualify as a capital lease are classified as an operating lease. Operating lease rental expenses included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $49,136 and $25,625, respectively      (q)   Selling expenses      Selling expenses include store-related expense, other than store occupancy costs, as well as advertising, depreciation and amortization, and certain expenses associated with operating the Company s corporate headquarters.      (r)   Advertising costs      The Company expensed all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses, net of reimbursement from suppliers, amounted to $22,953 and $Nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Advertising expense is included in selling expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.              SLEEPAID HOLDING CO.   AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO   UNAUDITED   CONSOLIDATED   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 2.

Our business generates revenue in the currency of the PRC, Renminbi ( RMB ). RMB is still not a freely exchangeable currency. Since 1998, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China has promulgated a series of circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under a Chinese entity s current account items, and has imposed strict requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors.           This may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans, the creation of foreign security, and the borrowing of RMB under guarantees in foreign currencies. Moreover, the value of RMB may become subject to supply and demand, which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments. Any fluctuations in the exchange rate of RMB could have an adverse effect on the operational and financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries in China.     In an effort to eliminate concerns over the ability to transfer cash between entities, cross border and to U.S. investor, Guangzhou Sleepaid Household Supplies Co., Ltd. ( Sleepaid Household ), our subsidiary and parent company to Yuewin Trading. ( Yuewin ), is incorporated in China as a wholly-owned foreign enterprise ( WOFE ).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   and Contractual Obligations       As at September 30, 2016, our material off-balance sheet arrangements are operating lease obligations. We excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our office and warehouse. These leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term. With respect to most of those leases, we intend to renegotiate those leases as they expire.

Based on this evaluation, our CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. Such conclusion reflects the identification of material weakness as follows: (1) lack of accounting proficiency of our chief financial officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function, and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review. Until we are able to remedy these material weaknesses, we have engaged third party consultants and accounting firm to assist with financial reporting.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the six months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
