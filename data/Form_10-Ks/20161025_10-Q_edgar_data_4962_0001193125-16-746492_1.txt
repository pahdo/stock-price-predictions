1.  
  Basis of Presentation         The Company    
 American Express Company (the Company) is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences
that enrich lives and build business success. The Company s principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Business travel-related
services are offered through the non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT JV). The Company s various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses,
mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.  
 Effective for the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segment presentation to reflect the organizational changes announced during
the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are as follows:      

U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), including the proprietary U.S. Consumer Card Services business and travel services in the United States;    

International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), including the proprietary International Consumer Card Services business, Global Network Services (GNS) business and travel services outside the United States;

Global Commercial Services (GCS), including the proprietary Global Corporate Payments (GCP) business, small business services businesses in the United States and internationally (collectively, Global Small Business
Services), merchant financing products and foreign exchange services operations; and        

Global Merchant Services (GMS), including the Global Merchant Services business and global loyalty coalition businesses.    
 Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate   Other.  
 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Annual Report). If not materially different, certain footnote disclosures included therein have been omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 The interim consolidated financial information in this report has not been audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which
consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period consolidated financial information, have been made. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the
entire year.    The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These accounting
estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.    Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts
have been made to conform to the current period presentation. During 2016, the Company determined that in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the comparative periods ended June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and
December 31, 2015, certain activities related to long-term debt repayments were misclassified between financing activities and operating activities.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)       
  
There is no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has evaluated the effects of these misclassifications and concluded that none are material
to any of its previously issued quarterly or annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Nevertheless, the Company has elected to revise prospectively the comparative periods mentioned above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
this revision resulted in a $250 million decrease to both Net cash used in financing activities and Net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, travel commissions and fees, which were separately disclosed on the Consolidated Statements
of Income historically, are now included within Other fees and commissions.      Recently Issued Accounting Standards    
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The guidance
establishes the principles to apply to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition, specifying the accounting for certain costs related to revenue, and requiring additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenues and related cash flows. The guidance, as amended, supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption as of January 1, 2017, permitted. The Company does not
intend to adopt the new standard early and continues to evaluate the method of implementation and the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The
guidance, which is effective January 1, 2018, makes targeted changes to current GAAP, specifically to the classification and measurement of equity securities, and to certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial
instruments. The Company continues to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases. The guidance, which is effective January 1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted, requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard early and continues to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on its financial
position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items.    In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on employee
share-based payments. The guidance, which is effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted, simplifies various aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, accounting for
award forfeitures, and classification on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Among other items, the guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies, which under previous guidance would have been recorded within additional paid-in
capital, to now be recognized in the income tax provision within the results of operations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, among other items, but
does not expect the impacts of the standard to be material upon adoption. The Company will adopt the standard, prospectively, effective January 1, 2017.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, which is effective
January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The guidance introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which is based on expected losses, and differs significantly
from the incurred loss approach used today. The CECL model requires measurement of expected credit losses not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating
forward-looking information and will likely result in earlier recognition of credit reserves. The Company does not intend to adopt the new standard early and is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its financial position,
results of operations and cash flows; however, it is expected that the new CECL model will alter the assumptions used in calculating credit losses on Card Member loans and receivables, among other financial instruments, and may result in material
changes to the Company s credit reserves.

  Business Events       During the first half of 2016, the Company completed the sales of
substantially all of its outstanding Card Member loans and receivables held for sale (HFS) and recognized gains, as an expense reduction in Other expenses, of $127 million and $1.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
June 30, 2016, respectively. The impact of the sales is reported within the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a net decrease in Card Member receivables and loans, including held for sale.

3.  
  Loans and Accounts Receivable       The Company s lending and charge payment card
products result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables, respectively. This Note is presented excluding amounts associated with the Card Member loans and receivables HFS as of December 31, 2015; the Company did not
have any Card Member loans and receivables HFS as of September 30, 2016.    Card Member loans by segment and Other loans as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted of:       

(a) 
 Includes approximately $24.8 billion and $23.6 billion of gross Card Member loans available to settle obligations of a consolidated variable interest entity (VIE) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.    

(b) 
 Other loans primarily represent merchant financing loans. Other loans are presented net of reserves for losses of $30 million and $20 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
     Card Member accounts receivable by segment and Other receivables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
consisted of:       

(c) 
 Other receivables primarily represent amounts related to (i) certain merchants for billed discount revenue, (ii) GNS partner banks for items such as royalty and franchise fees, and (iii) loyalty coalition
partners for points issued, as well as program participation and servicing fees. Other receivables are presented net of reserves for losses of $48 million and $43 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

    Card Member Loans and Card Member Receivables Aging    
 Generally, a Card Member account is considered past due if payment is not received within 30 days after the billing statement date. The
following table presents the aging of Card Member loans and receivables as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       

(a) 
 For GCP Card Member loans and receivables in GCS, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been
received within 90 days of the Card Member s billing statement date. In addition, if the Company initiates collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan and receivable
balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes.        

(b) 
 Delinquency data for periods other than 90 days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days
past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances.

    Credit Quality Indicators for Card Member Loans and Receivables    
 The following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the nine months ended September 30:  

(a) 
 The Company presents a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, because the Company considers uncollectible
interest and/or fees in estimating its reserves for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.    
   Impaired Card Member Loans and Receivables    
 Impaired Card Member loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for
which it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the Card Member agreement. In certain cases, these Card Member loans and receivables are included in one of the
Company s various Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) modification programs.  

Table of Contents  

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)       
  The following tables provide additional information with respect to the Company s
impaired Card Member loans and receivables. Impaired Card Member receivables are not significant for ICNS as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015; therefore, the segment s receivables are not included in the following tables.

(a) 
 The Company s policy is generally to accrue interest through the date of write-off (typically 180 days past due). The Company establishes reserves for interest that it believes will not be collected. Amounts
presented exclude Card Member loans classified as a TDR.        

(b) 
 Non-accrual loans not in modification programs primarily include certain Card Member loans placed with outside collection agencies for which the Company has ceased accruing interest.    

(d) 
 In Program TDRs include Card Member accounts that are currently enrolled in a modification program.        

(e) 
 Out of Program TDRs include $123 million and $84 million of Card Member accounts that have successfully completed a modification program and $39 million and $29 million of Card Member accounts that were not in
compliance with the terms of the modification programs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

 The following table provides additional information with respect to the USCS and GCS Card Member loans and receivables modified as TDRs for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The ICNS Card Member loans and receivables modifications were not significant; therefore, this segment is not included in the following TDR disclosures.  

(a) 
 Represents the outstanding balance immediately prior to modification. The outstanding balance includes principal, fees and accrued interest on Card Member loans and principal and fees on Card Member receivables.
Modifications did not reduce the principal balance.    

(b) 
 For Card Member loans, there have been no payment term extensions.    

(c) 
 The Company does not offer interest rate reduction programs for Card Member receivables as the receivables are non-interest bearing.

  The following table provides information with respect to the USCS and GCS Card Member loans
and receivables modified as TDRs that subsequently defaulted within 12 months of modification, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. A Card Member is considered in default of a modification program after one and up to
two consecutive missed payments, depending on the terms of the modification program. For all Card Members that defaulted from a modification program, the probability of default is factored into the reserves for Card Member loans and receivables.

Company classifies as available-for-sale and carries at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCI), net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are
recognized upon disposition of securities on a trade-date basis in the Consolidated Statements of Income using the specific identification method.  
 The following is a summary of investment securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(a) 
 Represents mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.        

(b) 
 Other comprises investments in various mutual funds.

  The following table provides information about the Company s investment securities with
gross unrealized losses and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses due to temporary impairments by ratio of fair
value to amortized cost as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
 
  Overall, for the investment securities in gross unrealized loss positions (i) the Company does not
intend to sell the investment securities, (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and (iii) the Company expects that the contractual
principal and interest will be received on the investment securities. As a result, the Company recognized no other-than-temporary impairment during the periods presented.  
 Contractual maturities of investment securities with stated maturities as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide
with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

  Asset Securitizations       The Company periodically securitizes Card Member loans and
receivables arising from its card businesses, including, prior to the sales discussed in Note 2, Card Member loans and receivables HFS, through the transfer of those assets to securitization trusts. The trusts then issue debt securities to
third-party investors, collateralized by the transferred assets.    The following table provides information on the restricted cash held by
the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) and the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust, collectively the Trusts) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, included in Other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets:       
 
  These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to
fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.    American Express
Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), in its role as servicer of the Trusts, has the power to direct the most significant activity of the Trusts, which is the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, TRS
directly and indirectly (through its consolidated subsidiaries) holds all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. As of September 30, 2016, TRS  direct and
indirect ownership of variable interests was $13.3 billion for the Lending Trust and $2.0 billion for the Charge Trust. These variable interests held by TRS provide it with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses,
which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, TRS is the primary beneficiary of both Trusts and therefore consolidates both Trusts.  
 Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with
the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015, no such triggering events occurred.

  Contingencies       In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are
subject to various claims, investigations, examinations, pending and potential legal actions, and other matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). The Company discloses its material legal proceedings
under Part II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  in the Annual Report.  
 The Company s legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members.
These legal proceedings involve various lines of business of the Company and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations
and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against the Company specify the damages claimed by the plaintiff or class, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of
damages claimed against the Company are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal
issues to enable the Company to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that the Company is able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss.  
 The Company has recorded reserves for certain of its outstanding legal proceedings. A reserve is recorded when it is both (a) probable
that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the recorded reserve. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings
that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the reserve that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable.  
 For those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve
for legal contingencies or where there is no such reserve, and for which the Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $190 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters. This range
represents management s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent the Company s maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such proceedings evolve, including the merchant claims
described under  Legal Proceedings  in the Annual Report, the Company may need to increase its range of possible loss or reserves for legal contingencies.  
 Based on its current knowledge, and taking into consideration its litigation-related liabilities, the Company believes it is not a party to,
nor are any of its properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is
possible that the outcome of legal proceedings, including the possible resolution of merchant claims, could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations.

9.  
  Derivatives and Hedging Activities       The Company uses derivative financial instruments
(derivatives) to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index or price, and are carried at fair
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of the Company s market risk management. The Company does
not transact in derivatives for trading purposes.    In relation to the Company s credit risk, under the terms of the derivative
agreements it has with its various counterparties, the Company is not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balances or post collateral upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. Based on its assessment
of the credit risk of the Company s derivative counterparties as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company does not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments.  
 The following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       

(a) 
 Includes foreign currency derivatives embedded in certain operating agreements.    

(b) 
 Represents the offsetting of derivatives and the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from derivatives executed with the same counterparty under
an enforceable master netting arrangement. The Company received non-cash collateral from a counterparty in the form of security interests in U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value of $24 million as of September 30, 2016, none of which was
sold or repledged. Such non-cash collateral economically reduced the Company s risk exposure to $341 million but did not reduce the net exposure on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any such non-cash
collateral as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, the Company posted $144 million and $149 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as initial margin on its centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such
amounts are recorded within Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances.    

(c) 
 Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement.    

(d) 
 The Company has no individually significant derivative counterparties and therefore, no significant risk exposure to any single derivative counterparty. The total net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are
presented within Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.      A majority of the
Company s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are subject to master netting agreements with its derivative counterparties. The Company has no derivative amounts subject to enforceable
master netting arrangements that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.      Fair Value Hedges    
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its fixed-rate long-term debt. The Company uses interest rate swaps to
economically convert certain fixed-rate debt obligations to floating-rate obligations at the time of issuance. The Company hedged $17.0 billion and $18.8 billion of its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt using interest rate swaps as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  The following table summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in Other expenses associated
with the Company s fair value hedges for the three and nine months ended September 30:       
 
  The Company also recognized a net reduction in interest expense on long-term debt of $55 million and $73
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $173 million and $214 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements (interest
accruals) on the Company s interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.      Net Investment Hedges    
 The effective portion of the gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation
adjustment, was a loss of $18 million and a gain of $384 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and gains of $25 million and $545 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, with any ineffective portion recognized in Other expenses during the period of change. Specifically, the net hedge ineffectiveness recognized was nil and a gain of $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Other amounts related to foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI into Other expenses included a gain of $5 million and nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no amounts
related to foreign exchange contracts reclassified from AOCI into Other expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges    
 The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or
losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in net losses of $4 million and $3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a net loss of $12 million and a net gain of $102 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are recognized in Other expenses.  
 Related to its derivatives not designated as hedges, the Company previously disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, gains of $19 million and $15 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These amounts should have been disclosed as gains of $8
million and $389 million, respectively, which are the amounts used to calculate the above-referenced net loss of $3 million and net gain of $102 million. These changes to the previously disclosed amounts have no impact on the Consolidated Statements
of Income, Balance Sheets or Cash Flows.    The changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative resulted in a gain of $1 million and a
loss of $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a gain of $7 million and a loss of $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are recognized in Card
Member services and other expense.

    Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements    
 The Company has certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair
value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if determined to be impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value due to
impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $384 million impairment charge, consisting of a $219 million write-down of the entire balance of goodwill in the Prepaid Services business and a $165 million
write-down of technology and other assets, to fair value.      
   The Company provides Card Member protection plans that cover losses
associated with purchased products, as well as certain other guarantees and indemnifications in the ordinary course of business.    In
relation to its maximum potential undiscounted future payments as shown in the table that follows, to date the Company has not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. The Company s initial recognition of
these instruments is at fair value. In addition, the Company establishes reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  
 The following table provides information related to such guarantees and indemnifications as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015:       

(a) 
 Represents the notional amounts that could be lost under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed or indemnified parties. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments for
Merchant Protection are measured using management s best estimate of the maximum exposure, which is based on all eligible claims in relation to annual billed business volumes.    

(b) 
 Included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.        

(c) 
 Primarily includes guarantees related to the Company s purchase protection, real estate and business dispositions.

(a) 
 Refer to Note 2 for additional information.    

(b) 
 Other expense primarily includes general operating expenses, gains and losses on sales of assets or businesses not classified as discontinued operations, regulatory and litigation-related costs, certain Card Member
reimbursements, insurance costs, certain loyalty coalition-related expenses, and foreign currency-related gains and losses (including the favorable impact from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015). In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a valuation allowance adjustment associated with loans and receivables HFS.

   The effective tax rate was 34.2 percent and 34.7 percent for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 33.9 percent and 34.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The changes in tax rates primarily reflected the level of pretax income in
relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.    The Company is under continuous examination by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. The IRS has completed its field
examination of the Company s federal tax returns for years through 2007; however, refund claims for certain years continue to be reviewed by the IRS. In addition, the Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2008 through
2014.    The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by
as much as $527 million principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years  tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years  tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain
expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $527 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $310 million relates to amounts that if recognized would be recorded in
shareholders  equity and would not impact the Company s results of operations or its effective tax rate.      

15.  
  Earnings Per Common Share (EPS)       The computations of basic and diluted EPS were as
follows:       

(a) 
 The Company s unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class
method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the
denominator.        

(b) 
 The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 3.2 million and 0.6 million of options for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
2.2 million and 0.5 million of options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive.

Stored-value/prepaid products      Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups,
including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response
advertising.    We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving and
growing alternative payment providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers  existing accounts and relationships to create payment
or other fee-based solutions.    Our products and services generate the following types of revenue for the Company:  

Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on our network;    

Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances;        

Net card fees, which represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees;        

Other fees and commissions, which are earned on card-related fees (such as late fees and assessments), foreign exchange conversions, loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and other service fees;
and        

Other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including commissions and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and
other insurance programs, prepaid card-related revenues, revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement, earnings from equity method investments (including the GBT JV) and other miscellaneous revenue and fees.

  Effective for the first quarter of 2016, we realigned our segment presentation to reflect the organizational
changes announced during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior periods have been restated to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS), Global
Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant Services (GMS), with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate   Other. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.      Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures    
 Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to
the  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  section. We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain

   Bank Holding Company      American Express Company is
a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) is our primary federal regulator. As such, we are subject to the Federal Reserve s regulations,
policies and minimum capital standards.      Business Environment    
 During the third quarter we remained focused on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, optimize our investments and reset our cost base. Our results
reflected progress on our cost reduction efforts and steady credit performance, partially offset by a higher level of investment spending and a restructuring charge. Reported billed business, loans and revenues declined year-over-year primarily due
to the end of our relationship with Costco Wholesale Corporation in the United States (Costco) and the sales of the Card Member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue)
(collectively, the HFS portfolios). However, we saw underlying growth in billed business, loans and revenues on an adjusted basis, as described further below. In addition, our strong capital position allowed us to return capital to shareholders.
   For the third quarter, worldwide billings adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were down year-over-year, but were up after excluding
Costco-related billings from the prior year. Billings in the quarter were also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses. We continued to see differing trends between spending by large
corporations, which declined year-over-year, and spending by middle market and small businesses, which grew versus the prior year after adjusting for the effects of Costco. International billings continued to be strong.  
 Revenues net of interest expense declined year-over-year on a reported basis, reflecting lower billed business and a decline in Card Member loans. After
excluding Costco-related revenues from the prior year, adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew year-over-year resulting from an increase in adjusted billed business and growth in net card fees across our premium card portfolios. Net interest
income also declined year-over-year on a reported basis, reflecting lower Card Member loans and higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio, due to an increase in interest rates versus the prior year. Excluding Costco cobrand
card-related activity from the prior year, adjusted net interest income grew year-over-year as a result of growth in adjusted Card Member loans.  

Table of Contents  

  Card Member loans declined reflecting the sales of the HFS portfolios in the first half of the year. Adjusted
Card Member loans grew year-over-year, after excluding from the prior year Card Member loans related to these portfolios. Provision expenses on a reported basis were also down year-over-year as the prior period included credit costs associated with
the HFS portfolios. Provision expenses, adjusted for these credit costs, increased primarily as a result of growth in adjusted Card Member loans and seasoning of loans related to new Card Members. We expect that continued growth in adjusted loans
and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates, due primarily to this seasoning of loans related to new Card Members, will both contribute to an increase in provision expenses going forward.  
 Total expenses decreased versus the prior year, reflecting a decline in rewards expense, partially offset by an increase in investment spending on growth
initiatives. The decrease in rewards expense was driven by the Costco cobrand expenses included in the prior year and the continued shift in volumes to cash rebate products, for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue.
After adjusting for the Costco cobrand, we expect rewards expense, including costs associated with cash rebate products, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our card product value propositions over time. In addition, we expect
that our investment spending on growth initiatives, including marketing and promotion, during the fourth quarter will be significantly higher than in the third quarter.  
 Competition remains intense across our businesses, particularly in the U.S. While our businesses are global and diversified, to remain competitive we need to
continue to demonstrate the value we deliver to merchants, customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships. More intense competition has and will continue to impact our cost of renewing and ability to win or extend cobrand and
other relationships. Throughout our business, we are focused on those products, services and relationships that offer the best value to our customers while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders.

 Effective December 1, 2015, we transferred the Card Member loans and receivables related to our HFS portfolios to Card Member loans and receivables HFS
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 18, 2016 and June 17, 2016, we completed the sales of the JetBlue and Costco cobrand card portfolios, respectively. For the periods from December 1, 2015, through the sale completion dates,
the primary impacts beyond the HFS classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics, which do not reflect amounts related to these HFS loans and receivables, as credit costs were reported in Other
expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment. Other, non-credit related metrics (i.e., billed business, cards-in-force, net interest yield) reflect amounts related to the HFS portfolios through the sale completion dates. Additionally, for
periods after the sale completion dates, activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the HFS portfolios are no longer included in our Consolidated Results of Operations. Specifically, these impacts include: Discount revenue from Costco
in the U.S. for spend on all American Express cards and from other merchants for spend on the Costco cobrand card; Other fees and commissions and Interest income from Costco cobrand Card Members; and Card Member rewards expense related to the Costco
cobrand card.     Table 1: Summary of Financial Performance

    Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense    
 Discount revenue decreased $262 million or 5 percent and $401 million or 3 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by the Costco-related revenue included in the prior year, as previously mentioned, as well as increases in contra-discount revenues, including higher cash rebate rewards, partially
offset by lower discount revenue share with GNS issuing partners.    Billed business decreased 3 percent and increased 1 percent for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. U.S. billed business decreased 9 percent and 1 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily driven by
Costco-related volumes in the prior year. Non-U.S. billed business increased 10 percent and 6 percent in the same respective periods.    The average
discount rate was 2.47 percent and 2.45 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 2.46 percent and 2.48 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase for
the three-month period reflects the absence of Costco merchant volumes in the current year, which were at a lower discount rate than the average. The decrease for the nine-month period was driven primarily by a prior-year benefit related to certain
merchant rebate accruals, growth of the OptBlue program and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the recent European regulatory changes, partially offset by the benefit to the discount rate from the decline in Costco merchant
volumes in the current period. We expect the average discount rate will likely decline over time due to further expansion of OptBlue, overall changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, merchant incentives and concessions, volume
related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives, competition, pricing regulation (including regulation of competitors  interchange rates) and other factors. See Tables 5, 6 and 7 for more details on billed business
performance and the average discount rate.    Net card fees increased $68 million or 10 percent and $148 million or 7 percent for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios.  
 Other fees and commissions decreased $33 million or 5 percent and $86 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by Costco-related fees included in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition-related fees.  
 Other revenues decreased $21 million or 4 percent and increased $21 million or 1 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Both periods reflect Costco-related revenues in the prior year and lower revenues related to the GBT JV transition services agreement in the current period, both of which were more than
offset in the nine-month period by a contractual payment from a GNS partner in the second quarter of 2016 and higher revenues from our Prepaid Services business.  
 Interest income decreased $140 million or 7 percent and increased $56 million or 1 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Both periods reflect Costco-related interest income in the prior year, which was more than offset in the nine-month period by modestly higher yields and an increase in average Card Member
loans (including Card Member loans HFS).    Interest expense increased $31 million or 8 percent and $68 million or 6 percent for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances, partially offset by lower average long-term debt.

   Provisions for Losses      Charge card provision for
losses decreased $29 million or 14 percent and $46 million or 8 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by lower net write-offs and improved
delinquencies.    Card Member loans provision for losses increased $10 million or 3 percent and remained flat for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as the current year periods do not reflect credit costs associated with the HFS portfolios, as previously mentioned, which was offset by strong momentum in our
lending growth initiatives, resulting in higher loan balances and net write-offs.    Other provision for losses decreased $6 million and increased $29
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily driven by higher net write-offs in the merchant financing loan
portfolio as a result of historic growth, whereas the decrease in the three-month period was due to improving merchant financing loan credit performance.

 Beginning December 1, 2015 through to the sale completion dates, includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the HFS portfolios.    
   Expenses      Marketing and promotion expenses
increased $83 million or 10 percent and $228 million or 10 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives,
predominantly within the USCS and ICNS segments.    Card Member rewards expenses decreased $197 million or 11 percent and $167 million or 3 percent for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases were primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of $236 million and $289 million, in the same respective periods,
primarily reflecting Costco-related expenses in the prior year, as well as, in the current year, a shift in volumes to cash rebate products for which the rewards costs are classified as contra-discount revenue, partially offset in both periods by
increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products. The lower cobrand rewards expense was partially offset by higher Membership Rewards expense of $38 million and $122 million, in the same respective periods, primarily driven by an
increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes and a lower benefit in the weighted average cost per point (WAC).

  The Membership Rewards URR for current program participants was 95 percent (rounded down) at September 30,
2016, compared to 95 percent (rounded up) at September 30, 2015.    Card Member services and other expenses increased $9 million or 3 percent and $69
million or 9 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by increased usage of travel-related benefits.  
 Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased $51 million or 4 percent and $285 million or 8 percent for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by restructuring in the current year.    Other
expenses decreased $137 million or 8 percent and $1.2 billion or 26 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases in both periods reflected an
impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs, partially offset by a litigation reserve release, both in the prior year, and lower technology-related costs in the current year. The decrease in the nine-month period
also reflected the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios, partially offset by the benefit in the prior year from both the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities and other foreign exchange (FX) related activity.  
   Income Taxes      The effective tax rate was 34.2
percent and 33.9 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 34.7 percent and 34.2 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The changes in tax rates primarily
reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business.

Selected Income Statement Data       
   USCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to consumers in the United States, including
consumer travel services.    Non-interest revenues decreased $268 million or 13 percent and $377 million or 6 percent for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to lower discount revenue, which decreased $266 million or 17 percent and $413 million or 9 percent for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting Costco-related revenues in the prior year and higher cash rebate rewards in the current year, for which the rewards costs are
classified as contra-discount revenue. Billed business decreased 15 percent and 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by Costco-related
volumes included in the prior year. The decrease in discount revenue was partially offset by an increase in net card fees, resulting from growth in the Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios.  
 Net interest income decreased $148 million or 12 percent and $48 million or 1 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by Costco-related interest income included in the prior year and higher interest expense in the current year, partially offset in the nine-month period by modestly higher
yields and an increase in average Card Member loans (including Card Member loans HFS).    Overall, provisions for losses decreased $19 million or 6 percent
and $28 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as the current year periods do not reflect credit costs associated with the HFS portfolios, as
previously mentioned, which was partially offset by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives, resulting in higher loan balances and net write-offs.

  Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $122 million or 9 percent
and was relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Both periods reflect lower cobrand rewards expense due to Costco-related expenses in the prior year,
which was offset in the nine-month period by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives, and an increase in Card Member services expense, driven by increased usage of new benefits.  
 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased $30 million or 4 percent and $976 million or 43 percent for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily driven by lower operating expenses, partially offset by restructuring in the
current year. The decrease in the nine-month period primarily reflects the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios.

   ICNS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards outside the United States and enters into partnership agreements with
third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. It also provides travel services to consumers outside the United States.  
 Non-interest revenues increased $64 million or 6 percent and $138 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher discount revenue, due to an increase in both proprietary and non-proprietary (i.e., GNS) billed business, and higher net card fees. The increase in the
nine-month period also reflected a contractual payment from a GNS partner in the second quarter of 2016. Total billed business increased 8 percent and 6 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to
the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased proprietary and GNS cards-in-force and average spend per card. Refer to Tables 6 and 7 for additional information on billed business by region.  
 Interest income was relatively flat and decreased $18 million or 3 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting the impact of changes in FX rates year-over-year. FX-adjusted interest income increased 8 percent and 7 percent, in the same respective periods, primarily driven by higher average FX-adjusted loan

compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding period against which such results are being compared).
FX-adjusted revenues and expenses constitute non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of
another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

  Interest expense was relatively flat and decreased $9 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting the impact of changes in FX rates year-over-year. FX-adjusted interest expense increased 6 percent for both periods driven by higher funding costs. 2     Provisions for losses increased $7 million or 9 percent and $10 million or 4 percent for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by higher net write-offs.    Marketing,
promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses increased $50 million or 10 percent and $102 million or 7 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in
the prior year, primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives.    Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were
relatively flat for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and increased 3 percent for both periods on an FX-adjusted basis, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by restructuring in the current
year. 2      The effective tax rate in all periods reflects the recurring permanent tax benefit related
to the segment s ongoing funding activities outside the United States, which is allocated to ICNS under the Company s internal tax allocation process. The effective tax rate for 2016 also reflects the allocated share of tax benefits
related to the resolution of certain prior years  items. In addition, the effective tax rate in each of the periods reflects the impact of recurring permanent tax benefits on varying levels of pretax income.

   GCS issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides payment and expense management services
globally. In addition, GCS provides financing products for qualified merchants.    Non-interest revenues were relatively flat for both the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year, with billed business increasing 1 percent and 3 percent over the same respective periods, offset by Costco-related revenues in the prior year.  
 Net interest income decreased $22 million or 11 percent and increased $23 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Both periods reflect Costco-related revenues in the prior year, which were more than offset in the nine-month period by an increase in average Card Member loans (including Card Member
loans HFS), partially offset by higher interest expense.    Provisions for losses decreased $14 million or 9 percent and remained relatively flat for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to improving merchant financing loan credit performance.  
 Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $18 million or 2 percent and increased $57 million or 2 percent for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily driven by Costco-related expenses in the prior year, partially offset by higher
investment spending in the current year. The increase in the  nine-month  period was primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expense, due to higher spending volumes, and increased marketing and promotion
expense.

  Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $41 million or 6 percent and remained
relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to a restructuring charge in the current quarter, and
higher operating expenses, including technology development and professional fees. In the nine-month period, these increases were offset by the gains on the sales of the HFS portfolios.

   GMS operates a global payments network that processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. GMS
acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data, leveraging the Company s global closed-loop network. GMS also operates loyalty coalition businesses in certain countries around the world.
   Non-interest revenues decreased $79 million or 7 percent and $151 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, as a result of Costco-related revenues in the prior year, as well as higher contra-revenues in the current year.  
 Net interest income increased $14 million or 30 percent and $26 million or 17 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting a higher interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing and funding rates, which resulted in a net benefit for GMS due to its merchant payables.  
 Marketing, promotion, rewards, Card Member services and other expenses decreased $23 million or 29 percent and $39 million or 19 percent for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher marketing and promotion expenses related to our loyalty coalition business in the prior year.  
 Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased $21 million or 5 percent and decreased $18 million or 1 percent for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the three-month period was primarily driven by a litigation reserve release in prior year. In the nine-month period, this
increase was more than offset by growth of the OptBlue program, which does not entail merchant acquirer payments.

driven by the impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs in the prior year, partially offset by restructuring in the current year. In the nine-month period, this decrease, combined with higher income from our
Prepaid Services business, was more than offset by the benefit in the first quarter of 2015 from both the reassessment of the functional currency of certain UK legal entities and other  FX-related  activity.

   Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity   
 Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:      

A solid and flexible equity capital profile;        

A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and        

Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds
under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.        Transitional Basel III    
 The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, American Express
Centurion Bank (AECB) and American Express Bank, FSB (FSB), as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of September 30, 2016.

(a) 
 Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $600 million of subordinated notes adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries.
     We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient
manner; failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of American Express, AECB and FSB to take actions that could limit our business operations.
   Our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. Historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as
the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. To the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to
shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program.    We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our
businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital profile and
liquidity levels at the American Express parent company level. We do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non-U.S. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a U.S. parent company.  
 The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance:  
  Risk-Weighted Assets    Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines.
On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal
part of the total risk-weighted assets.     Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio    Calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 capital
( CET1 ), divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of common shareholders  equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as
follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit/losses, all net of tax and subject to transition provisions.  
  Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio    Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1, our perpetual
preferred stock and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries adjusted for capital to be held by insurance subsidiaries and deferred tax assets from net operating losses not deducted from CET1.  

Table of Contents  

   Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio    Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided
by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, and $600 million of subordinated notes
adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries.     Tier 1 Leverage Ratio    The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1
capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. Average total consolidated assets as of September 30, 2016 were $154.2 billion. 
  Supplementary Leverage Ratio    The supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure under Basel
III. Leverage exposure, which reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions, average off-balance sheet derivatives exposures, securities purchased under agreements to resell and credit equivalents of
undrawn commitments that are both conditionally and unconditionally cancellable. Total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes as of September 30, 2016 was $178.7 billion.  
   Fully Phased-in Basel III      Basel III, when fully
phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk-based capital
ratios and leverage ratios had Basel III been fully phased-in as of September 30, 2016. These ratios are calculated using the Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets. As noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward
Basel III Advanced Approaches implementation in the United States. We believe the presentation of these ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital and leverage ratios.

(a) 
 The Fully Phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 or Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules, as applicable,
divided by risk-weighted assets under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules. Refer to Table 21 for a reconciliation of Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules to Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital under
Transitional Basel III rules.        

(b) 
 The Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios, non-GAAP measures, are calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total assets and Fully Phased-in total
leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III, respectively.        

(c) 
 Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III risk-weighted assets, a non-GAAP measure, reflect our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied
to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns.        

(d) 
 Estimated Fully Phased-in Basel III Leverage Exposure, a non-GAAP measure, reflects average total consolidated assets with adjustments for Tier 1 capital deductions on a fully phased-in basis, off-balance sheet
derivatives, undrawn conditionally and unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet liabilities.      The Basel capital
standards establish minimum requirements for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios that are 1.5 percent higher than the minimum requirements for CET1 risk-based capital ratios. This difference between Tier 1 capital, which includes common equity and
qualifying preferred securities, and CET1 is also present in the minimum capital requirements within Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). 

Table of Contents  

We issued $1.6 billion of preferred shares to help finance a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.  
 Our $750 million of subordinated debentures, which prior to 2014, were fully included in Tier 2 capital (but not in Tier 1 capital), do not meet the
requirements of Tier 2 capital under Basel III and thus were redeemed for cash on September 1, 2016 at 100 percent of the principal amount outstanding. As previously mentioned, we issued $600 million of subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier
2 capital under Basel rules.    The following table presents a comparison of our Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Transitional Basel
III rules to our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital under Fully Phased-in Basel III rules as of September 30, 2016.  
  Table 21: Transitional Basel III versus Fully Phased-in Basel III       
    Fully Phased-in Basel III Risk-Weighted Assets    Reflects our Basel III risk-weighted assets, with all transition
provisions fully phased in. This includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns.  
  Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratio    Calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1 capital by our average total
consolidated assets.     Fully Phased-in Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio    Calculated by dividing Fully Phased-in Basel III Tier 1
capital by our Fully Phased-in total leverage exposure for supplementary leverage ratio purposes under Fully Phased-in Basel III.      Share Repurchases
and Dividends      We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares
outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans.    During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we returned $0.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends ($0.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively) and share repurchases ($0.6 billion and $3.4 billion,
respectively). We repurchased 8.8 million common shares at an average price of $64.39 in the third quarter of 2016. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 75 percent and 92 percent of total capital
generated during the three and nine-month periods, respectively.    In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had $750 million
of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the  Series B Preferred Shares ) and $850 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares (the  Series C Preferred Shares ) outstanding. Dividends declared and paid on Series C
Preferred Shares during the third quarter of 2016 were $21 million.

    Funding Strategy    
 Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost-effectively
finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile.     Summary of Consolidated Debt
    We had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015:  
  Table 22: Consolidated Debt       
   Management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy
Basel III s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the
requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time.    Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to
maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody s Investor Services (Moody s), Standard   Poor s (S P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS).
Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset-backed securitization activities are rated separately.

asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt
and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on
our funding capacity and costs.  

Table of Contents  

       Deposit Programs        
 We held the following deposits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
  Table 24: Customer Deposits       

(a) 
 The weighted average remaining maturity and weighted average rate at issuance on the total portfolio of U.S. retail CDs, issued through direct and third-party programs, were 23.8 months and 1.93 percent, respectively,
as of September 30, 2016.       Asset Securitization Programs   
 We periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective
funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from
issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.    The loans and receivables being
securitized are reported as Card Member loans and receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related securities issued to third-party investors are reported as long-term debt.  
 Under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets
of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, no such triggering events occurred.
     Liquidity Management      We incur liquidity risk
that arises in the course of offering our products and services. Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources, even in the event we are unable to
raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions, in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and our businesses  requirements for liquidity for a period of at
least twelve months. Our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk.    The liquidity risks that we are exposed to
could arise from a wide variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:      

Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the  Funding Strategy  section for more details);        

Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources;        

Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios;        

Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements;        

Incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework.    

Table of Contents  

  The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress
scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) and other regulatory measures of liquidity, such as the LCR, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. The
Company was in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which it is subject, including the LCR, for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 The investment income we receive on liquidity resources, such as cash, is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The net
interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial. The level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment
yields.     Securitized Borrowing Capacity     As of
September 30, 2016, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the Charge Trust. We
also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 17, 2018, that gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the Lending Trust. On
September 12, 2016, we extended the Lending Trust s $2.0 billion facility by one year to mature on September 17, 2018. Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to
further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of September 30, 2016, $2.2 billion was drawn on the Charge Trust facility. No amounts were drawn on the Lending Trust facility.  
  Federal Reserve Discount Window     As insured depository
institutions, the Banks may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of
qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the Federal
Reserve.    We had approximately $54.9 billion as of September 30, 2016 in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over
time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria.  
  Committed Bank Credit Facilities     In addition to the
secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of September 30, 2016 of $3.0 billion, which expires on December 9, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, no
amounts were drawn on this facility.      Certain Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $239 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements.
Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are
not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members.

 Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income and (ii) changes in the
balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments.    For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, driven by net income of $4.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, adjusted for non-cash items
including changes in provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock-based compensation. The current period net income includes the $1.2 billion gain on the sales of the HFS portfolios, which is presented in Net
decrease (increase) in Card Member receivables and loans, including held for sale, within cash flows from investing activities. The decrease was also driven primarily by impacts from movements in Other assets and Accounts payable and Other
liabilities as a result of normal business operating activities.     Cash Flows from Investing Activities   
 Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member receivables and loans, including Card Member loans and receivables HFS, along
with gains on sales related thereto, as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio.    For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and 2015, net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $10.1 billion and $(2.7) billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was
primarily driven by the sales of the HFS portfolios.     Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
 Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, changes in customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares,
and paying dividends.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $11.2 billion and
$7.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the current period, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily resulted from a net decrease in short-term borrowings and customer deposits, partially offset by lower net
repayments of long-term debt in the current year, as compared to the same period in the prior year.

   OTHER MATTERS   
  Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments   
 As a participant in the financial services industry, and as a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Federal
Reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations. In light of the current environment of additional regulation, enhanced supervision efforts and increased regulatory investigations and enforcement, compliance
requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including us, and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future.  
 In addition, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through antitrust
actions, legislation and rules to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. Regulators and
legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards, including the way bankcard network members collectively set the  interchange  (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment
networks like Visa and MasterCard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Although, unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks, the American Express network does not have interchange fees or collectively
set fees or rules, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly , as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other
things, lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating
rewards, services or benefits to cardholders and merchants. Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing
infrastructure, which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and
maintain and extend our global network.    In certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, merchants are permitted by law to
surcharge card purchases. While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about
excessive surcharging by merchants. Surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members, which is known as differential surcharging, as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some
countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. The Reserve Bank of Australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to  the reasonable cost of card acceptance.  As
discussed below, the Reserve Bank of Australia recently amended its rules to limit surcharging in Australia to the merchant s actual cost of card acceptance. In the EU, in those Member States that permit surcharging, the Consumer Rights
Directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the cost of acceptance.    On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a
referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit,  which has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in capital and currency markets worldwide. The full impact of Brexit,
however, remains uncertain. A process of negotiation, which is likely to take two years or longer, will determine the future terms of the U.K. s relationship with the European Union. It is unclear at this stage what financial, trade and legal
implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.

   European Union Payments Legislation   
 In 2015, the European Union adopted legislation in two parts, covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry. The first part was an EU-wide
regulation on interchange fees (the Interchange Fee Regulation); the second consisted of revisions to the Payment Services Directive (the PSD2).    The
Interchange Fee Regulation was formally adopted in April 2015. The substantive terms as adopted include the following:      

Price caps   Interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the EU are capped as of December 2015, generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards, with
the possibility of lower caps in some instances. Although we do not have interchange fees and  three party  networks such as American Express are exempt from the application of the caps, the regulation provides that  three party 
networks should be treated as  four party  networks (such as Visa and MasterCard, which have interchange fees) when they license third-party providers to issue cards and/or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a cobrand partner
or through an agent. This means, for example, the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our GNS partners in the EU, which may undermine our ability to attract and retain GNS partners. While the
discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped, the interchange caps have exerted, and will likely continue to exert, downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including our discount rates. We have brought a legal challenge
and seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent. The Interchange Fee Regulation excludes commercial card
transactions from the scope of the caps.        

Card acceptance terms   Anti-steering  and honor-all-cards rules across all card networks, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements, are prohibited
with some exceptions. Removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and Card Member dissatisfaction, which would result in harm to the American Express brand. The prohibition on  anti-steering rules  took
effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation; the prohibition on honor-all-cards rules took effect in June 2016.        

Network licensing   In December 2015, the geographic scope of the network licenses that we agree to with our GNS partners in the EU was amended to cover the entire EU in order to meet the requirements of the
regulation. This allows GNS partners to actively pursue their American Express business throughout the EU, including countries where we or other GNS partners are present, and may undermine the value of licenses granted to some GNS partners to date,
which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity to incentivize development of the American Express business in relation to a particular country.        

Separation of network processing   From June 2016, card networks are required to separate their network processing functions (in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for
authorization, clearing and settlement). This provision does not generally apply to  three party  payment networks, such as American Express, but may be deemed applicable, for example, where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved
in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network.        

Co-badging of cards   From June 2016, a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks. Merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point-of-sale
equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network, subject to override by the cardholder. These provisions may harm the American Express brand insofar as GNS issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and
merchants may program their point-of-sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards.    

Table of Contents  

  The PSD2 was adopted on November 25, 2015, and was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
on December 23, 2015. Each Member State has until January 2018 to transpose the PSD2 into national law.    Among other terms, the published text of
PSD2 includes provisions that will (i) further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost,
subject potentially to the decision of an individual Member State to prohibit surcharging altogether; and (ii) require all networks, including  three party  payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, such as our GNS
business, to establish objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network, for example, as a licensed issuer or acquirer. The potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of
differential surcharging of our cards, prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to Card Member dissatisfaction. The access requirements will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to
date in deciding with whom to partner in our GNS business and, together with requirements in the Interchange Fee Regulation, may undermine the value of our GNS business in Europe.  
  Australia Payments Regulation     Following a formal review
of the regulatory framework for card payments in Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia adopted new regulations on May 26, 2016, including the following:      

Interchange caps   as of July 1, 2017, the interchange fee paid on Visa and MasterCard credit transactions must not exceed a weighted-average benchmark of 0.50 percent across all transactions, with a maximum
interchange fee cap of 0.80 percent for each individual credit card transaction.        

The inclusion of our GNS business in Australia under interchange regulation, which subjects GNS payments to bank partners to the same interchange caps and regulations that apply to Visa and MasterCard credit card
transactions in Australia, effective July 1, 2017.        

Broadening the definition of interchange fees to include any fees paid by networks to card-issuing banks as incentives to issue cards, as well as any other net payments made to card issuers.    

Increasing the frequency of periodic weighted-average benchmark calculations from every three years to quarterly to confirm compliance with the interchange caps. In determining compliance, all transactions at Australian
merchants (including commercial card transactions, but excluding those on foreign-issued cards) will be taken into consideration.        

Changing the rules on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer, as recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer; the changes
took effect as of September 1, 2016 for large merchants and will take effect September 1, 2017 for other merchants.      The inclusion
of our GNS business under interchange regulation may undermine our ability to attract and retain GNS partners. While the discount rates we agree to with merchants do not include an interchange component and are therefore not capped, the interchange
caps, once effective, will likely exert downward pressure on merchant fees across the industry, including our discount rates.     Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act     Dodd-Frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial
institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Among other matters, the law created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and
other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. Moreover, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer
financial products and services, including certain of our subsidiaries. The CFPB is directed to prohibit  unfair, deceptive or abusive  acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive
markets for consumer financial products and services.  

Table of Contents  

  The review of products and practices to assess compliance and prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will
be a continuing focus of the CFPB and regulators more broadly, as well as our own internal reviews. For example, federal banking regulators have recently announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are
cooperating with regulators in those reviews. Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures. Such reviews are also likely to continue to result in
increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, and additional restitution to our Card Members and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties.  
 On May 5, 2016, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that, if enacted, would, among other changes, require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to
cases filed in court as class actions, unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed. The CFPB has set a 90-day period for comment, with the rule becoming effective 211 days after enactment and applying to all
agreements entered into after that date.    On July 28, 2016, the CFPB outlined proposals under consideration that would set forth additional
requirements for  third-party  debt collection agencies, which we use in the ordinary course. This proposal is part of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule, if any, becoming effective before
2018.    As of March 1, 2017, regulations implementing Dodd-Frank s margin requirements would result in us collecting and remitting cash and/or
securities collateral relative to the value of certain uncleared derivative transactions (variation margin), which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for us.  
  Antitrust Litigation     The U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) and certain states  attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our
card products violate the U.S. antitrust laws. The trial court had ruled that the challenged provisions violate U.S. antitrust laws and issued an injunction. We appealed this judgment and on September 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for American Express. We continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings. See
Part II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  for a description of the DOJ case and Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K) for
descriptions of the related cases. It is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages, could have a
material adverse effect on our business. See Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in the 2015 Form 10-K for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business.

    Recently Issued Accounting Standards    
 Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
   Glossary of Selected Terminology       Adjusted net
interest income    A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans and loans HFS (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense
and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. The Company believes adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on Card Member loans.  
  Asset securitizations    Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the
securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans or receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities
to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables. The loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (together, the Trusts) being securitized are reported as assets, and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported
as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.     Average discount rate    This calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at
merchants accepting general-purpose American Express cards. It represents the percentage of billed business (generated from both proprietary and GNS Card Member spending) retained by us from merchants we acquire, or for merchants acquired by a third
party on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third party.     Basic cards-in-force    Proprietary basic consumer cards-in-force includes
basic cards issued to the primary account owner, (i.e., not including additional supplemental cards issued on accounts). Proprietary basic small business and corporate cards-in-force includes both basic and supplemental cards issued. Non-proprietary
basic cards-in-force includes cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for supplemental cards and retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior
twelve-month period.     Billed business    Includes activities (including cash advances) related to proprietary cards, cards issued under network
partnership agreements (non-proprietary billed business), corporate payment services and certain insurance fees charged on proprietary cards. In-store spending activity within retail cobrand portfolios in GNS, from which we earn no revenue, is not
included in non-proprietary billed business. Card billed business is included in the United States or outside the United States based on where the issuer is located.  
  Capital ratios    Represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has
sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under  Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity  for further related definitions under
Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-in Basel III.     Card Member    The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded charge, credit
and certain prepaid cards.     Card Member loans    Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on their American
Express credit cards, as well as any interest charges and card-related fees. Card Member loans also include revolving balances on certain American Express charge card products.  
  Card Member loans and receivables HFS    Beginning as of December 1, 2015 and continuing until a sale is completed, represents Card Member
loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with Costco in the United States and JetBlue. The JetBlue and Costco portfolio sales were completed on March 18 and June 17, 2016, respectively.  

Table of Contents  

   Card Member receivables    Represents the outstanding amount due from Card Members for charges made on
their American Express charge cards, as well as any card-related fees.     Charge cards    Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set
spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Charge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. No finance charges are assessed on charge cards. Each charge card
transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Some charge card accounts have an additional lending-on-charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.
    Credit cards    Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, grace periods, and rate and fee structures.  
  Discount revenue    Represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement. The
discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for Card Member purchases. Discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants, payments to third-party card issuing partners, cash-back reward costs and statement credits,
corporate incentive payments and other similar items.     Interest expense    Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and
receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers
and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as
the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt.     Interest income    Includes (i) interest on loans,
(ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other.     Interest on loans   
Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans and loans HFS. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable
account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.     Interest and dividends on investment securities    Primarily relates to
our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on
the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled.  
  Interest income on deposits with banks and other    Recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term
funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts.     Liquidity
Coverage Ratio    Represents the proposed minimum standards being established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and
economic stress.     Merchant acquisition    Represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept American Express-branded
cards.     Net card fees    Represents the card membership fees earned during the period. These fees are recognized as revenue over the covered
card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs.

   Net interest yield on Card Member loans   A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net
interest income by average loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses, and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. The Company
believes net interest yield on Card Member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of the Company s Card Member loan portfolio.    
  Net loss ratio    Represents the ratio of GCP charge card write-offs, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions) and fee
components, less recoveries, on Card Member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate Card Members.     Net write-off rate
    principal only    Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage
of the average loan or receivables balance during the period.     Net write-off rate     principal, interest and fees    Includes, in the
calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.  
  Operating expenses    Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses.  
  Return on average equity    Calculated by dividing one-year period net income by one-year average total shareholders  equity.  
  Return on average segment capital    Calculated by dividing one-year period segment income by one-year average segment capital.  
  Segment capital    Represents the capital allocated to a segment based upon specific business operational needs, risk measures, and regulatory
capital requirements.     Total cards-in-force    Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding. Non-proprietary cards-in-force
includes all cards that are issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements, except for retail cobrand Card Member accounts which have no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve-month period.

     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include
(i) interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and (ii) foreign exchange risk
related to earnings, transactions and investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. There were no material changes in these market risks since December 31, 2015.  
    ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.    There have not been any changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.      Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements    
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and
uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as  believe,   expect,   estimate,   anticipate, 
 intend,   plan,   aim,   will,   may,   should,   could,   would,   likely,  and similar expressions. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these
forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:      

our ability to grow in the future, which will depend in part on the following: revenues growing consistently with
current expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, weakening economic conditions in the United States or internationally, a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of Card Members to sustain spending,
a further decline in airfare and gas prices, a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected, a greater impact on discount revenue from cash back, GNS volumes and cobrand partner and client
incentive payments, more cautious spending by large and global corporate Card Members and lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated; our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives,
including growing profitable spending from new and existing Card Members, increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients, expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance; the level of spend in bonus
categories on rewards-based and/or cash-back cards and redemptions of Card Member rewards and offers; the impact of any future restructuring charges or other contingencies, including, but not limited to, litigation-related settlements, judgments or
expenses, impairments, the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, an increase in Card Member reimbursements and changes in reserves; credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations;

Table of Contents  

continued growth of Card Member loans; the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations; the amount we
spend on growth initiatives and our ability to drive growth from such investments; changes in interest rates beyond current expectations; the impact of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of our business activities, limit
our ability to pursue business opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners, merchants and Card Members; our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations, which could be impacted by, among
other things, our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected, changes in tax laws and regulation (including final and temporary Treasury regulations under Section 385 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code) and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program;     

the actual amount to be spent on growth initiatives, including on marketing and promotion, as well as the timing of any such spending, which will be based in part on management s assessment of competitive
opportunities; overall business performance; prior commitments; contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs relative to revenue levels; management s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such
investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities; and our ability to realize efficiencies, optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending;    

rewards expense, including costs associated with cash rebate products, growing at a different rate than current expectations, which will depend in part on Card Member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns,
spending volumes and redemption behaviors, as well as the degree of interest of Card Members in the value proposition we offer; our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to Card Members; and the amount we spend on the
promotion of enhanced card products and rewards categories and the success of such promotion;        

our ability to reduce our overall cost base, which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of reengineering plans, which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and
other risks posed by potential staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings and underestimating hiring and other employee needs; our ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be
impacted by, among other things, the factors identified below; and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses, which could be impacted by higher advertising and Card Member acquisition costs, competitive pressures that may
require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs, an inability to shift acquisition to digital channels, the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic
conditions;        

the ability to reduce annual operating expenses, which could be impacted by increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, including as a result of increased
litigation, compliance or regulatory-related costs, technology costs or fraud costs; our ability to develop, implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans; higher than expected employee levels; the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates on costs; the payment of civil money penalties, disgorgement, restitution, non-income tax assessments and litigation-related settlements; impairments of goodwill or other assets; management s decision to increase or
decrease spending in such areas as technology, business and product development and sales forces depending on overall business performance; greater than expected inflation or merit increases; our ability to balance expense control and investments in
the business; the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications; and the level of M A activity and related expenses;

our lending write-off rates and provision expense being higher than current expectations, which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances, delinquency rates, mix of loan balances, loans related to new
Card Members and other borrowers performing as expected, unemployment rates, the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written-off loans;        

our ability to execute against our lending strategy and grow loans, which may be affected by increasing competition, brand perceptions and reputation, our ability to manage risk in a growing Card Member loan portfolio,
and the behavior of Card Members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns, which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products, offer attractive non-card lending products, capture a greater share of existing
Card Members  spending and borrowings, reduce Card Member attrition and attract new customers;        

the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for OptBlue to significantly increase merchant coverage, which will depend in part on the success of OptBlue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept
American Express, which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers, the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of OptBlue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for American Express acceptance, as well as the
willingness of Card Members to use American Express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept American Express cards;        

changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators, the amount
we spend on acquisitions and results of operations and capital needs in any given period;        

changes in global economic and business conditions, consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of capital, unemployment rates, geopolitical conditions (including potential impacts resulting from the
proposed exit of the U.K. from the European Union), foreign currency rates and interest rates, all of which may significantly affect spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results
of operations;        

changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access
to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates; changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets; or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost
and other terms of our funding, restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts;        

legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business, including with regard to broad payment system regulatory regimes, such as in Europe and Australia, consumer financial product protection actions by the CFPB and
other regulators and the stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations,
or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock; potential actions by the FDIC and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our ABS program; or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the
allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services;        

changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for cobrand
relationships and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs;    

Table of Contents  

changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as
the airline industry, or our partners in GNS or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; and    

factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, terrorism, cyber attacks or fraud, which could significantly affect
spending on American Express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and travel-related spending or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions.    
 A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the 2015 Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.       PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various claims, investigations, examinations, pending and potential legal actions,
and other matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively,  legal proceedings ). We believe we have meritorious defenses to each of these legal proceedings and intend to defend them vigorously. Some of these
proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages.    We believe we are not a party to, nor are any of our properties the
subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings,
including the possible resolution of merchant claims described in our 2015 Form 10-K, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are further described in this section and
others, for which there have been no subsequent material developments since the filing of our 2015 Form 10-K, are described in such report.    For those
legal proceedings described in this section and in the 2015 Form 10-K where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related reserve for legal contingencies or where there is no such reserve, and for which we are able
to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $190 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters. This range represents our estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our
maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such proceedings evolve, including the merchant claims, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or reserves for legal contingencies. For additional information, see Note 8
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.    In 2010, the DOJ, along with Attorneys General from Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii (Hawaii has since withdrawn
its claim), Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Vermont filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against us,
MasterCard International Incorporated and Visa, Inc., alleging a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (the  DOJ case ). The complaint included allegations that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants
from steering a customer to use another network s card or another type of general-purpose card ( anti-steering  and  non-discrimination  contractual provisions) violate the antitrust laws. The complaint sought a judgment
permanently enjoining us from enforcing our non-discrimination contractual provisions. The complaint did not seek monetary damages. Following a non-jury trial in the DOJ case, the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive
and on April 30, 2015, the court issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction.  

Table of Contents  

Following our appeal of this judgment, on September 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment
for American Express.    On November 6, 2015, a putative representative action, captioned People of the State of California, ex. rel. Dennis Herrera v.
American Express Co. et al., was filed in California state court on behalf of the People of California by the San Francisco City Attorney for the benefit of California merchants that accept American Express cards. The complaint alleges that certain
terms in our merchant agreements violate California law and seeks relief in the form of: (1) a declaratory judgment; (2) an injunction preventing us from enforcing those terms; (3) statutory civil penalties in an amount to be
determined by the court; (4) restitution for alleged overcharges; and (5) attorney s fees and cost of suit. On October 7, 2016, the San Francisco City Attorney filed a stipulation dismissing this action without prejudice.  
 We are a defendant in a class action captioned  Kaufman v. American Express Travel Related Services , which was filed on February 14, 2007, and is
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs  principal allegation is that our gift cards violated consumer protection statutes because consumers allegedly had difficulty spending small residual
amounts on the gift cards prior to the imposition of monthly service fees. The Court preliminarily certified a settlement class consisting of (with some exceptions)  all purchasers, recipients and holders of all gift cards issued by American
Express from January 1, 2002 through the date of preliminary approval of the settlement.  On March 2, 2016, the court granted final approval of the class-wide settlement. Notices of appeal have been filed.  
 On July 30, 2015, plaintiff Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund, on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of American Express stock,
filed a suit, captioned  Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Jeffrey C. Campbell , for violation of federal securities law, alleging that the Company deliberately issued false and
misleading statements to, and omitted important information from, the public relating to the financial importance of the Costco cobrand relationship to the Company, including, but not limited to, the decision to accelerate negotiations to renew the
cobrand agreement. The plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief. The Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on March 21, 2016.    On
October 16, 2015, a putative class action, captioned  Houssain v. American Express Company, et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA) relating to disclosures of the Costco cobrand relationship. On May 10, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint naming certain officers of the Company as defendants and alleging that the defendants violated certain ERISA
fiduciary obligations by, among other things, allowing the investment of American Express Retirement Savings Plan (Plan) assets in American Express common stock when American Express common stock was not a prudent investment and misrepresenting and
failing to disclose material facts to Plan participants in connection with the administration of the Plan. The amended complaint seeks, among other remedies, an unspecified amount of damages. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint on May 31, 2016.    On March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of
themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned  B R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam s Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al. , for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California s Cartwright Act and
unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants,
through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive
relief. On June 24, 2016, the court granted our motion to transfer to the Southern District of New York the claims brought against us by merchants who accept American Express cards. The court also granted plaintiffs  leave to file an
amended complaint and, on September 30, 2016, denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards.  

Table of Contents  

  In October 2009, a putative class action, captioned  Lopez, et al. v. American Express Bank, FSB and American
Express Centurion Bank , was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The amended complaint sought to certify a class of California American Express Card Members whose interest rates were changed from
fixed to variable in or around August 2009 or otherwise increased. On August 20, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended nationwide complaint and an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of a settlement of the claims alleged in that complaint.
The settlement provides for certain relief to class members, attorneys  fees and costs of up to $6 million. On October 17, 2016, the court granted final approval of the settlement.  

ITEM 1A.  
  RISK FACTORS       For a discussion of our risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
of the 2015 Form 10-K. There are no material changes from the risk factors set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K. However, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.

     ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

(c)  
  ISSUER PURCHASES OF SECURITIES       The table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases of
the Company s common stock made by or on behalf of the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2016.      

(a) 
 On September 26, 2016, the Company announced the authorization to repurchase up to 150 million shares of common stock from time to time, in accordance with the capital distribution plans approved by the
Federal Reserve and subject to market conditions. The authorization replaced the prior repurchase authorization and does not have an expiration date.    

(b) 
 Includes: (i) shares surrendered by holders of employee stock options who exercised options (granted under the Company s incentive compensation plans) in satisfaction of the exercise price and/or tax
withholding obligation of such holders and (ii) restricted shares withheld (under the terms of grants under the Company s incentive compensation plans) to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon vesting and release of restricted
shares. The Company s incentive compensation plans provide that the value of the shares delivered or attested to, or withheld, be based on the price of the Company s common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs.

(c) 
 Share purchases under publicly announced programs are made pursuant to open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) as market conditions warrant and at prices the Company
deems appropriate.

ITEM 5.  
  OTHER INFORMATION       Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act
of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings
relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in
compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.    During the third quarter of 2016, American Express
Travel   Lifestyle Services obtained two visas from Iranian embassies in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients. In addition, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) and certain entities that may be
considered affiliates of GBT have informed us that during the third quarter of 2016 they obtained approximately 80 visas from Iranian embassies and consulates around the world in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients. We
had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions and intend to continue to engage in these activities on a limited basis so long as such activities are permitted under U.S. law.

 AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  
 COMPUTATION IN SUPPORT OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED  
 STOCK DIVIDENDS    ( Dollars in
Millions )      

(a) 
 Included in interest expense is interest expense related to the Card Member lending activities, international banking operations, and charge card and other activities in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest
expense does not include interest on liabilities recorded under GAAP governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company s policy is to classify such interest in income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(b) 
 For purposes of the  earnings  computation,  other adjustments  include adding the amortization of capitalized interest, the net loss of affiliates accounted for under the equity method whose debt is
not guaranteed by the Company, the noncontrolling interest in the earnings of majority-owned subsidiaries with fixed charges, and the interest component of rental expense, and subtracting undistributed net income of affiliates accounted for under
the equity method.        

(c) 
 For purposes of the  fixed charges  computation,  other adjustments  include capitalized interest costs and the interest component of rental expense.
