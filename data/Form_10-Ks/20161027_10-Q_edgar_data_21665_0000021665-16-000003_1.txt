1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
       
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which, in management s opinion, are necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. Results of operations for interim periods may not be representative of results to be expected for a full year.  
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  on January 1, 2016. To conform to the current year s presentation, debt issuance costs have been reclassified from Other assets and are now presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt balance at December 31, 2015. The reclassification had no further effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  For a complete set of financial statement notes, including the significant accounting policies of Colgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Colgate ), refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form  10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

2. 
    Use of Estimates 
       
  Provisions for certain expenses, including income taxes, media advertising and consumer promotion, are based on full year assumptions and are included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in proportion with estimated annual tax rates, the passage of time or estimated annual sales.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  On August 26, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are to be presented in the Statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends accounting for income taxes related to share-based compensation, the related classification in the statement of cash flows and share award forfeiture accounting. This guidance requires recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies (resulting from an increase or decrease in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or exercise date) in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur. Currently, excess tax benefits are recognized in equity. In addition, these amounts will be classified as an operating activity in the Statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity.  
    
  For the years 2013 to 2015, the Company recognized excess tax benefits in equity in the range of approximately   $50   to   $60   per year. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard, as any excess tax benefits recognized would be dependent on future stock prices, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  
    
  On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,  which eliminates the requirement to retroactively adjust an investment that subsequently qualifies for equity method accounting (as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence) as if the equity method of accounting had been applied during all prior periods that the investment was held. The new standard requires that the investor add the cost of acquiring additional ownership interest in the investee to its current basis and prospectively adopt the equity method of accounting. Any unrealized gains or losses in an available-for-sale investment that subsequently qualifies as an equity method investment should be recognized in earnings at the date the investment qualifies as an equity method investment. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

  (Unaudited) 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued its final standard on lease accounting, ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which supersedes Topic 840,  Leases.  The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. The new standard also provides additional guidance on the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and will require enhanced disclosures about the Company s leasing arrangements. This new standard is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires a  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments and includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amendment to the standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. Under the new accounting standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent, eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent. As permitted, the Company adopted the new standard on March 31, 2016, on a prospective basis, and did not retrospectively adjust prior periods.  
    
  On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out ( LIFO ) and the retail inventory method. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. The standard, issued as ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  by the FASB, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Principal versus Agent Considerations),  to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing),  to clarify the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients),  to clarify the implementation guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The standard allows for either  full retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new standard will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Acquisitions and Divestitures 
       
  Sale of Land in Mexico 
    
  In September 2016, the Company s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received   $60   as the   third   and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the   third   installment and the previously received   first   and   second   installments) was   $120  . The Company recognized a pretax gain of   $97   (  $63   aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation. 

5. 
    Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges  
       
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded in 2014 and 2015 as described below, the  2012 Restructuring Program ) for sustained growth. The program s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 
    
  On October 23, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities. 
    
  Recognizing the macroeconomic challenges around the world and the successful implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program, on October 29, 2015, the Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it for   one   year through December 31, 2017. The Board approved the implementation plan for this expansion on March 10, 2016. Initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program will continue to fit within the program s three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be   $1,405   to   $1,585   (  $1,050   to   $1,170   aftertax).  
    
  The pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (  50%  ); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (  10%  ); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (  20%  ) and the implementation of new strategies (  20%  ). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately   75%   of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to approximate   $270   to   $310   (  $200   to   $230   aftertax). It is expected that substantially all charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program will be incurred by December 31, 2017.

    COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY 
     Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (  15%  ), Europe (  20%  ), Latin America (  5%  ), Asia Pacific (  5%  ), Africa/Eurasia (  5%  ), Hill s Pet Nutrition (  10%  ) and Corporate (  40%  ), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, when it has been fully implemented, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately   3,300     3,800   positions from the Company s global employee workforce. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 

Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.  
    
  Total charges incurred for the 2012 Restructuring Program relate to initiatives undertaken by the following reportable operating segments:    

(1)    The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the reporting structure effective as of April 1, 2016.  See   Note 13  ,   Segment Information   for additional details.

  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred pretax cumulative charges of   $1,156   (  $853   aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows:    

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; the simplification and streamlining of the Company s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; and restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of the U.S.-based employees participating in the Company s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company s defined contribution plan. 
  The following tables summarize the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges discussed above and the related accruals:

Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements.  Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to   $1   and $  3   for the three  and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see Note 10, Retirement Plans and Other Retiree Benefits). 
    
  Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets. 
    
  Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $  17   and $  74  , respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $  3   and   $19  , respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are other exit costs related to the consolidation of facilities of $  0   and $  1  , respectively.

Since 2002, the Company has taken a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction that has been challenged by the tax authorities. In May 2015, the Company became aware of several Supreme Court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. The Company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those disallowed by the Court. As a result, as required, the Company reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by   $15   in the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Supreme Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company s favor for the years 2002 through 2005 and, as a result, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $  13   including interest.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Administrative Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the Supreme Court s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005, which eliminated the possibility of future appeals. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of   $17  , including interest, in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately $  14   at current exchange rates.  These deductions are currently being challenged by the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction either in the lower courts or at the administrative level and, if resolved in the Company s favor, will result in the Company recording additional tax benefits, including interest. 

As a global company serving consumers in more than   200   countries and territories, the Company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings. These include disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Management proactively reviews and monitors the Company s exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is party to various environmental matters and, as such, may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites. 
    
  The Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. 
    
  The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates. For those matters disclosed below, the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is   $0   to approximately   $250   (based on current exchange rates). The estimates included in this amount are based on the Company s analysis of currently available information and, as new information is obtained, these estimates may change. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company. Thus, the Company s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above. 
    
  Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above, an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year.

Brazilian Matters 
    
  There are certain tax and civil proceedings outstanding, as described below, related to the Company     s 1995 acquisition of the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (the      Seller     ). 
    
  The Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, at the current exchange rate, are approximately   $142  . This amount includes additional assessments received from the Brazilian internal revenue authority in April 2016 relating to net operating loss carryforwards used by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary to offset taxable income that had also been deducted from the authority s original assessments. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments since October 2001. Numerous appeals are currently pending at the administrative level. In the event the Company is ultimately unsuccessful in its administrative appeals, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts.  
    
  In September 2015, the Company lost   one   of its appeals at the administrative level, and has filed a lawsuit in Brazilian federal court. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in this filing, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail. The Company is challenging these assessments vigorously. 
    
  In July 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda. (the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller) and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, in the 6th. Lower Federal Court in the City of S o Paulo, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital gains as a result of the divestiture of Kolynos. The action seeks to make the Company s Brazilian subsidiary jointly and severally liable for any tax due from the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary. The case has been pending since 2002, and the Lower Federal Court has not issued a decision. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the Company should ultimately prevail in this action. The Company is challenging this action vigorously. 
    
  In December 2005, the Brazilian internal revenue authority issued to the Company s Brazilian subsidiary a tax assessment with interest and penalties of approximately   $59  , at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company had been disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority s administrative appeals process. However, in November 2015, the Superior Chamber of Administrative Tax Appeals denied the Company s final administrative appeal and the Company has filed a lawsuit in Brazilian federal court. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in this filing, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail. The Company is challenging this assessment vigorously. 
    
  Competition Matters 
    
  European Competition Matters 
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries in Europe have been subject to investigations, and, in some cases, fines, by governmental authorities in a number of European countries related to potential competition law violations. The Company understands that substantially all of these matters also have involved other consumer goods companies and/or retail customers. The status of the various pending matters is discussed below. The Company s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry. Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and can result in substantial fines for violations that are found and associated private actions for damages. While the Company cannot predict the final financial impact of these competition law issues, as these matters may change, the Company evaluates developments in these matters quarterly and accrues liabilities as and when appropriate.

Fines have been imposed on the Company in the following matter, although, as noted below, the Company has appealed each of these fines: 

In December 2014, the French competition law authority found that 13 consumer goods companies, including the Company s French subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information related to the French home care and personal care sectors, for which the Company s French subsidiary was fined   $57  . In addition, as a result of the Company s acquisition of the Sanex personal care business in 2011 from Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V.,  Unilever ) pursuant to a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the  Sale and Purchase Agreement ), the French competition law authority found that the Company s French subsidiary, along with Hillshire Brands Company (formerly Sara Lee Corporation ( Sara Lee )), were jointly and severally liable for fines of   $25   assessed against Sara Lee s French subsidiary. The Company is entitled to indemnification for this fine from Unilever as provided in the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Company is appealing both fines in the French courts. 
       
  Currently, the following formal claim of violations is pending against the Company: 

In July 2014, the Greek competition law authority issued a statement of objections alleging a restriction of parallel imports into Greece. The Company has responded to this statement of objections. 
       
  Since December 31, 2015, the following matters have been resolved: 

In December 2009, the Swiss competition law authority imposed a fine of   $6   on the Company s GABA subsidiary for alleged violations of restrictions on parallel imports into Switzerland, which the Company appealed. In January 2014, this appeal was denied. The Company had appealed before the Swiss Supreme Court, but its appeal was denied in June 2016. 

In December 2010, the Italian competition law authority found that 16 consumer goods companies, including the Company s Italian subsidiary, exchanged competitively sensitive information in the cosmetics sector, for which the Company s Italian subsidiary was fined   $3  . The Company had appealed the fine in the Italian courts, but has decided not to further pursue its appeal. 
       
  Australian Competition Matter 
    
  In December 2013, the Australian competition law authority instituted civil proceedings in the Sydney registry of the Federal Court of Australia alleging that three consumer goods companies, including the Company s Australian subsidiary, a retailer and a former employee of the Company s Australian subsidiary violated the Australian competition law by coordinating the launching and pricing of ultra concentrated laundry detergents. In 2015, the Company recognized a charge of   $14   in connection with this matter. In March 2016, the Company and the Australian competition law authority reached an agreement to settle these proceedings for a total of   $14  , which includes a fine and cost reimbursement to the competition law authority. The former employee of the Company also reached an agreement to settle. The settlement agreements were approved by the court in May 2016.

Talcum Powder Matters 
    
  The Company is a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging that certain talcum powder products that were sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos. As of September 30, 2016, there were   101   individual cases pending against the Company in state and federal courts throughout the United States,   27   of which were filed against the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. On July 21, 2016, a jury rendered a verdict in the Company s favor in   one   of the cases following a trial in California, and the case was subsequently settled for an amount that is not material to the Company s results of operations. In addition to the pending cases, as of September 30, 2016,   29   cases filed against the Company had been voluntarily dismissed and/or had final judgment entered in favor of the Company, and the Company had settled   20   cases for amounts that are not material to the Company s results of operations. 
    
  A number of the pending cases have gone, or are expected to go, to trial in 2016. While the Company and its legal counsel believe that these cases are without merit and intend to challenge them vigorously, there can be no assurances of the outcome at trial. Since the amount of any potential losses from these cases currently cannot be reasonably estimated, the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities disclosed above does not include any amount relating to these cases. 
    
  N8 
    
  The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit pending in Utah federal court brought by N8 Medical, Inc. ( N8 Medical ), Brigham Young University ( BYU ) and N8 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( N8 Pharma ).  The complaint, originally filed in November 2013, alleges breach of contract and other torts arising out of the Company s evaluation of a technology owned by BYU and licensed, at various times, to Ceragenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now in bankruptcy, N8 Medical and N8 Pharma. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the court indicated that the claims brought by N8 Pharma would be dismissed in their entirety and the Company and BYU agreed to resolve BYU s claims for an amount that is not material to the Company s results of operations. The Company and its legal counsel believe the remaining claims of N8 Medical, which have been significantly reduced, are without merit and are vigorously challenging them and defending this case on its merits. If the case reaches a trial, the trial is expected to occur in 2017.

    Segment Information 
       
  The Company operates in   two   product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.  
    
  Effective April 1, 2016, the operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in   five   reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia. 
    
  Through March 31, 2016, the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment included the North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia geographic operating segments. As a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the Company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe/South Pacific and Asia reportable operating segments. Management responsibility for the South Pacific operations was transferred from Europe/South Pacific management to Asia management. Accordingly, commencing with the Company s financial reporting for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific reportable operating segment. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure. These changes have no impact on the Company s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.  
    
  The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation costs and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.

Net sales and Operating profit by segment were as follows: 

Approximately   75%   of the Company s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately   50%   of the Company s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). 
    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $42   resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a charge of $  6   for a previously disclosed litigation matter and a gain of   $97   on the sale of land in Mexico. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $156   resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a charge of $  6   for a previously disclosed litigation matter and a gain of   $97   on the sale of land in Mexico. 
    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $46   resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a charge of   $18   related to the remeasurement of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary s local currency-denominated net monetary assets as a result of an effective devaluation and a gain of   $187   on the sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , Corporate Operating profit (loss) included charges of   $198   resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a charge of   $34   related to the remeasurement of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiary s local currency-denominated net monetary assets as a result of an effective devaluation and a gain of   $187   on the sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific.

    Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 
       
  The Company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial instruments. Judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, changes in assumptions or the estimation methodologies may affect the fair value estimates. The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material, as it is the Company s policy to contract only with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations. 
    
  The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, sourcing strategies, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company s treasury and risk management policies, which prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose. It is the Company s policy to enter into derivative instrument contracts with terms that match the underlying exposure being hedged. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is not material for any period presented. 
    
  The Company s derivative instruments include interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and these swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates (Level 2 valuation). The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities arising in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are valued using observable market rates (Level 2 valuation). Commodity futures contracts are utilized to hedge the purchases of raw materials used in production. These contracts are measured using quoted commodity exchange prices (Level 1 valuation). The duration of foreign currency and commodity contracts generally does not exceed 12 months.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company s derivative instruments and other financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term debt approximated fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt, including the current portion, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $6,941   and   $6,767  , respectively, and the related carrying value was   $6,520   and   $6,544  , respectively. The estimated fair value of long-term debt was derived principally from quoted prices on the Company s outstanding fixed-term notes (Level 2 valuation).

Fair Value Hedges 
    
  The Company has designated all interest rate swap contracts and certain foreign currency forward and option contracts as fair value hedges, for which the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in current earnings. The impact of foreign currency contracts is primarily recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of interest rate swap contracts is recognized in Interest (income) expense, net. 
    
  Activity related to fair value hedges recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  All of the Company s commodity contracts and certain foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges, for which the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (     OCI     ) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
    
  Activity related to cash flow hedges recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

The net gain (loss) recognized in OCI for both foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts is expected to be recognized in Cost of sales within the next twelve months.

Net Investment Hedges 
    
  The Company has designated certain foreign currency forward and option contracts and certain foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges, for which the gain or loss on the instrument is reported as a component of Cumulative translation adjustments within OCI, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items. 
    
  Activity related to net investment hedges recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for each period consist of a cross-currency swap that serves as an economic hedge of a foreign currency deposit, for which the gain or loss on the instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in Other (income) expense, net for each period. 
    
  Activity related to these contracts during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

Other Financial Instruments 
    
  Other financial instruments are classified as Other current assets or Other assets. 
    
  Other financial instruments classified as Other current assets include marketable securities consisting of bank deposits of   $188   with original maturities greater than 90 days (Level 1 valuation) and the current portion of bonds issued by the Argentinian government in the amount of   $57  . The long-term portion of these bonds in the amount of   $4   is included in Other assets. 
    
  Through its subsidiary in Argentina, the Company has invested in U.S. dollar-linked, devaluation-protected bonds issued by the Argentinian government. These bonds are considered held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of these bonds was   $61   and their approximate fair value was   $93   (Level 2 valuation).

  Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

Executive Overview and Outlook 
    
  Colgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Colgate ) seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable. 
    
  To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth. 
    
  Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company s sales and profitability. Approximately   75%   of the Company s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately   50%   of the Company s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. 
    
  Effective April 1, 2016, the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in   five   reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians. 
    
  Through March 31, 2016, the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment included the North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific, Asia and Africa/Eurasia geographic operating segments. As a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the Company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe/South Pacific and Asia reportable operating segments within the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment. Management responsibility for the South Pacific operations was transferred from Europe/South Pacific management to Asia management. Accordingly, commencing with the Company s financial reporting for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific reportable operating segment, which results in a slight modification to the geographic components of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment, with no impact on historical Company results overall. 
    
  On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations) and gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. 
    
  To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company s products.

  (Dollars in Millions Except Share and Per Share Amounts) 

The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition. 
    
  In September 2016, the Company s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received   $60   as the   third   and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the   third   installment and the previously received   first   and   second   installments) was   $120  . The Company recognized a pretax gain of   $97   (  $63   aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation. 
    
  Effective December 31, 2015, the Company concluded it no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiary ( CP Venezuela ) and began accounting for CP Venezuela using the cost method of accounting. As a result, effective December 31, 2015, CP Venezuela s net assets and operating results are no longer included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior periods have not been restated and CP Venezuela s Net sales, Operating profit and Net income are included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income through December 31, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, under the cost method of accounting, the Company will include income relating to its Venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to CP Venezuela or for dividends or royalties from CP Venezuela. Although the operating results of CP Venezuela are no longer included in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the Company is required to continue including CP Venezuela s results in its consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a Global Growth and Efficiency Program (as expanded in 2014 and 2015 as described below, the  2012 Restructuring Program ) for sustained growth. The program s initiatives are expected to help the Company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 
    
  On October 23, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors  (the  Board ) approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities. On October 29, 2015, the Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it through December 31, 2017. The Board approved the implementation plan for this expansion on March 10, 2016. 
    
  The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: 
             
    Expanding Commercial Hubs 
                
    Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions 
                
    Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities 
       
  Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $  1,405   to $  1,585   ($  1,050   to $  1,170   aftertax). Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately   $430   to   $495   pretax (  $400   to   $475   aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. 
    
  In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred aftertax costs of   $32   and   $114  , respectively, associated with the 2012 Restructuring Program.

Looking forward, the Company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which the Company operates has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the Company does. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, the Company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company s future results. 
    
  The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company s global brands, its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.

Gross Profit/Margin 
    
  Worldwide Gross profit   decreased     1%   to   $2,324   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $2,347   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Gross profit in both periods included charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program. Excluding these charges in both periods, Gross profit   decreased   to   $2,335   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $2,350   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , reflecting a decrease of $77 resulting from the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015 and negative foreign exchange, partially offset by growth in organic sales. This decrease in Gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $62 resulting from higher Gross profit margin in the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  Worldwide Gross profit margin   increased   to   60.1%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   58.7%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .

This increase in Gross profit margin was primarily driven by cost savings from the Company     s funding-the-growth initiatives (  210   bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (  10   bps), and higher pricing (  110   bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (  180   bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015.

  North America 

Net sales in North America   increased     1.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   to   $800  , driven by volume growth of   1.5%   which was partially offset by net selling price decreases of   0.5%  , while foreign exchange was flat. Organic sales in North America increased   1.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  The increase in organic sales in North America in the   third   quarter of   2016   versus the   third   quarter of   2015   was primarily due to an increase in Personal Care organic sales, partially offset by a decline in organic sales in the Home Care category. The increase in Personal Care organic sales was due to strong organic sales in the shower gel and liquid hand soap categories. The decrease in Home Care organic sales was due to a decline in organic sales in the hand dish category.  
    
  Operating profit in North America   increased     6%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   to   $273  , or   150   bps to   34.1%   of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Gross profit (  90   bps) and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (  60   bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily driven by cost savings from the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives (  220   bps), partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (  140   bps). This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower overhead expenses (  70   bps), which were partially offset by an increase in advertising investment (  10   bps).

  The increase in organic sales in Latin America in the   third   quarter of   2016   versus the   third   quarter of   2015   was due to increases in Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care organic sales was driven by strong organic sales growth in the toothpaste category. Personal Care organic sales growth was driven by gains in the bar soap and underarm protection categories. The increase in Home Care organic sales was due to strong growth in the fabric softener and liquid cleaners categories. 
    
  Operating profit in Latin America   decreased     1%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   to   $298  , while as a percentage of Net sales, it increased   410   bps to   32.3%  . This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (  340   bps) and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (  30   bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was due to higher pricing as cost savings from the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives (  140   bps) were offset by higher costs (  140   bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015.

This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit (  40   bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (  150   bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily driven by higher raw and packaging material costs (  190   bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs, and lower pricing due to increased in-store promotional activities, partially offset by cost savings from the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives (  230   bps). The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher advertising investment (  150   bps).

  The increase in organic sales in Asia Pacific in the   third   quarter of   2016   versus the   third   quarter of   2015   was driven by Oral Care with strong organic sales in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories.

  Operating profit in Asia Pacific   increased   to   $230   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , or   60   bps to   31.8%   of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit (  30   bps) and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses (  10   bps), both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was mainly driven by cost savings from the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives (  310   bps) and the 2012 Restructuring Program (  10   bps), mix and higher pricing, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (  370   bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs. This decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower overhead expenses (  20   bps), which were partially offset by an increase in advertising investment (  10   bps).

Volume declines in the United States, Western Europe and Japan were partially offset by volume gains in the rest of Asia and Latin America. 
    
  The increase in organic sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   versus the   third   quarter of   2015   was due to an increase in organic sales in the Prescription Diet category, partially offset by a decline in organic sales in the Naturals and Advanced Nutrition categories. 
    
  Operating profit in Hill s Pet Nutrition   increased     3%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   to   $162  , or   10   bps to   28.9%   of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Gross profit (  40   bps) and a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (  70   bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (  100   bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was mainly driven by cost savings from the Company s funding-the-growth initiatives (  210   bps) and higher pricing, partially offset by higher costs (  320   bps), primarily driven by higher raw and packaging material costs, which included foreign exchange transaction costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (  70   bps) and higher overhead expenses (  30   bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was in part due to a foreign sales tax benefit.

Personal Care and Home Care also contributed to organic sales growth. The increase in Personal Care organic sales was due to strong growth in the shower gel, shampoo and bar soap categories. Home Care organic sales growth was driven by gains in the fabric softener and liquid cleaners categories, partially offset by a decline in the hand dish category.

This decrease in Gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $176 resulting from higher Gross profit margin in the   first nine months   of   2016  . 
    
  Worldwide Gross profit margin was   59.9%   in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to   58.6%   in the   first nine months   of   2015  .

The change in Operating profit reflects the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015.

Operating profit in the   first nine months   of   2016   also included a gain on the sale of land in Mexico and a charge for a previously disclosed litigation matter.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in Gross profit margin (  160   bps), partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales (  30   bps).

The Company     s current estimate of its full year effective income tax rate before discrete period items is   31.0%  , compared to   31.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . As reflected in the tables below, the non-GAAP income tax rate was   30.1%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   30.9%   in the comparable period of   2015  .

Since 2002, the Company has taken a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction that has been challenged by the tax authorities. In May 2015, the Company became aware of several Supreme Court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. The Company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those disallowed by the Court. As a result, as required, the Company reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by $15 in the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Supreme Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company s favor for the years 2002 through 2005 and, as a result, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $  13   including interest.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Administrative Court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the Company s favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the Supreme Court s ruling for the years 2002 through 2005, which eliminated the possibility of future appeals. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of   $17  , including interest, in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately $  14   at current exchange rates. These deductions are currently being challenged by the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction either in the lower courts or at the administrative level and, if resolved in the Company s favor, will result in the Company recording additional tax benefits, including interest. 
  Net Income Attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings Per Share 
    
  Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company in the   first nine months   of   2016     decreased   to   $1,835   from   $1,842   in the comparable   2015   period. The change in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company reflects the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015. Earnings per common share on a diluted basis   increased   to   $2.04   per share from   $2.02   per share in the comparable   2015   period.

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 
    
  2012 Restructuring Program  
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced the 2012 Restructuring Program. The program s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. 
    
  The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company     s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include: 

Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company     s operations around the world. 
                
    Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions. 
                
    Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company     s gross and operating profit. 
                
    Building on Colgate     s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth. 
       
  On October 23, 2014, the Board approved an expansion of the 2012 Restructuring Program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities. On October 29, 2015, the Board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific to expand the 2012 Restructuring Program and extend it through December 31, 2017. The Board approved the implementation plan for this expansion on March 10, 2016. 
    
  The initiatives under the 2012 Restructuring Program continue to be focused on the following areas: 
             
    Expanding Commercial Hubs   Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure. 
                
    Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions   Implementing the Company     s shared service organizational model in all regions of the world. While initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services are now being expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions. 
                
    Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities   Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market. 
       
  Cumulative pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be   $1,405   to   $1,585   (  $1,050   to   $1,170   aftertax).

The pretax charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (10%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of related implementation charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). Over the course of the 2012 Restructuring Program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. Anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to approximate   $270   to   $310   (  $200   to   $230   aftertax). 
    
  It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe (20%), Latin America (5%), Asia Pacific (5%), Africa/Eurasia (5%), Hill s Pet Nutrition (10%) and Corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that, when it has been fully implemented, the 2012 Restructuring Program will contribute a net reduction of approximately   3,300     3,800   positions from the Company s global employee workforce. 
    
  Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of   $430   to   $495   pretax (  $400   to   $475   aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. The Company continues to expect estimated savings in 2016 to approximate   $60   to   $70   pretax (  $55   to   $65   aftertax). 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , restructuring and related implementation charges are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: 

Restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

Total charges incurred for the 2012 Restructuring Program relate to initiatives undertaken by the following reportable operating segments: 

(1)    The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure. See      Executive Overview and Outlook       above for additional details.  
    
  Since the inception of the 2012 Restructuring Program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company has incurred cumulative pretax charges of   $1,156   (  $853   aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows: 

The majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the Company s overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; the simplification and streamlining of the Company s research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in Europe; the closing of the Morristown, New Jersey personal care facility; and restructuring how the Company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of the U.S.-based employees participating in the Company s defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the Company s defined contribution plan.

The following tables summarize the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges discussed above and the related accruals: 

Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $  1   and $  3   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding tables as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities. 
    
  Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets. 
    
  Other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $  17   and $  74  , respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $  3   and $  19  , respectively, directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred. Also included in Other charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are other exit costs related to the consolidation of facilities of $  0   and $  1  , respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  
    
  Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestments and the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is provided below. 
    
  Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q both on a GAAP basis and, as applicable, excluding charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, a gain on sale of land in Mexico, benefits from previously disclosed tax matters, a charge for a previously disclosed litigation matter, charges related to the remeasurement of CP Venezuela s local currency-denominated net monetary assets as a result of effective devaluations, a charge related to a foreign tax matter and a gain on sale of the Company s laundry detergent business in the South Pacific (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company s business performance and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets. 
    
  Net cash provided by operations   increased     10%   to   $2,317   in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $2,108   in the comparable period of   2015  , due to strong operating earnings and the timing of income tax payments, partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015 and voluntary contributions to employee postretirement plans. 
    
  The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). The Company s working capital   decreased   to   (3.4%)   as a percentage of Net sales in the   first nine months   of   2016   as compared to (  1.3%  ) in the   first nine months   of   2015  , reflecting the Company s tight focus on working capital and the impact of reclassifying current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets upon the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
    
  Approximately   75%   of total program charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program, estimated to be   $1,405   to   $1,585   (  $1,050   to   $1,170   aftertax) are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings from the 2012 Restructuring Program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of   $430   to   $495   pretax (  $400   to   $475   aftertax) annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. Anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to approximate   $270   to   $310   (  $200   to   $230   aftertax) and savings in 2016 are expected to approximate   $60   to   $70   pretax (  $55   to   $65   aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flows. Approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at   September 30, 2016   is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. 
    
  Investing activities used   $445   of cash in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $344   in the comparable period of   2015  . Purchases of marketable securities and investments   decreased   in the   first nine months   of   2016   to   $271   from   $499   in the comparable period of   2015  . Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments   decreased   in the   first nine months   of   2016   to   $158   from   $398   in the comparable period of   2015  . The   decrease   in purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments was primarily due to lower investments in bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days and the impact of the deconsolidation of the Company s Venezuelan operations effective December 31, 2015.  
    
  In September 2016, the Company s Mexican subsidiary completed the sale to the United States of America of the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were previously located and received   $60   as the   third   and final installment of the sale price. The total sale price (including the   third   installment and the previously received   first   and   second   installments) was   $120  . The Company recognized a pretax gain of   $97   (  $63   aftertax gain) in the third quarter of 2016, net of costs primarily related to site preparation. 
    
  Capital spending   decreased   in the   first nine months   of   2016   to   $392   from   $459   in the comparable period of   2015  . The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for   2016   are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, which is higher than the Company s historical rate of approximately 3.5%, primarily due to the 2012 Restructuring Program.

Financing activities used   $1,547   of cash during the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared with   $1,326   in the comparable period of   2015  , reflecting lower net proceeds from the issuances of debt, partially offset by lower purchases of treasury shares in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  . 
    
  Long-term debt, including the current portion,   decreased   to   $6,520   as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $6,544   as of   December 31, 2015   and total debt   decreased   to   $6,523   as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $6,548   as of   December 31, 2015  . The Company s debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   were $1,194 and $1,992, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its lines of credit. 
    
  Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. 
    
  In the first quarter of   2016  , the Company increased the annualized common stock dividend by 3% to $1.56 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents   increased     $328   during the   first nine months   of   2016   to   $1,298   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $970   at   December 31, 2015  , most of which ($1,265 and $932, respectively) were held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the Company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings. 
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately $4,600 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes had been provided as the Company considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, not subject to such taxes. 
    
  In order to fully recognize a   $210   U.S. income tax benefit in 2016 principally related to changes in Venezuela s foreign exchange regime, during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company decided to repatriate in 2016   $1,500   of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and accordingly, recorded a tax charge of   $210   during the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not anticipate a need to repatriate additional undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Any future repatriation would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. As the Company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world, and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.

Market Share Information  
    
  Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).  
  Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information.  The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months.  We believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 
    
  Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 Restructuring Program, tax rates, the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, new product introductions, commercial investment levels, acquisitions and divestitures, or legal proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit. For information about these and other factors that could impact the Company s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , including the information set forth under the captions  Item 1A.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   (the  Evaluation ). Based upon the Evaluation, the Company s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. As part of the 2012 Restructuring Program, the Company is implementing a shared business service organization model in all regions of the world. This implementation is expected to continue in a phased approach in future years. At this time, certain financial transaction processing activities have been transitioned to these shared business services centers. The Company does not expect this transition to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 2.        Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       
    
  On February 19, 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5 billion under a new share repurchase program (the  2015 Program ), which replaced a previously authorized share repurchase program. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company s compensation and benefit programs. The shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the Company s discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors. 
    
  The following table shows the stock repurchase activity for the three months in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  :

This Nonqualified Option must be exercised by the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day prior to this expiration date.  If this Nonqualified Option has not been exercised by 4:00pm (New York time) on the last business day prior to the expiration date, the Company will have the right to exercise such Nonqualified Option on your behalf and to deliver the resulting Shares, net of the exercise price and any applicable withholding taxes, to your limited brokerage account at Merrill Lynch or, if you do not have such an account, to a shareholder account in your name with the Company s transfer agent, Computershare. 

The number of Shares and the exercise price per Share are subject to adjustment as provided in the Plan.  You assume all risks incident to any change in applicable laws or regulations and any change in the market value of Shares after the date of grant and after exercise of this Nonqualified Option in whole or in part. 
    
  Data Privacy  .  By accepting the Nonqualified Option, you explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Award Agreement and any other Award grant materials ( Data ) by and among, as applicable, the Company, its subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively referred to in this Data Privacy section as the  Company ) and certain third party service providers including, but not limited to, Plan brokers, financial advisers and legal counsel,  engaged by the Company (collectively, the  Providers ) for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan     and complying with applicable laws, regulations and legislation.   
    
  You understand that the Data collected, used, transferred or held by the Company and the Providers consists of certain of Data about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other government identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Options or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor.  You further understand that such collection, use, transfer and holding of the Data is necessary for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan and complying with applicable laws, regulations and legislation.  You understand that the Company or the Providers may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the laws of the country in which the Company and the Providers collect, use or hold the Data may have different legal protections for the Data than your country.  However, regardless of the location of the Data, the Company protects the Data through reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards and requires that the Providers also have such safeguards in place.   
  You understand that you may, at any time, request a copy of your Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting your local human resources representative in writing.   You understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan as more fully described below.   
  You understand that you are providing the consent herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with your employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Options or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards.  Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative. 
    
  This Award Agreement and related Nonqualified Option are governed by, and subject to, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of laws, as provided in the Plan.   

Very truly yours,
