NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Capital
Financial Holdings, Inc., a North Dakota corporation, and its
subsidiaries Capital Financial Services, Inc. ( CFS )
and Capital Natural Resources, Inc. ( CNR )
(collectively, the "Company"), included herein have been prepared
by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto
contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, of Capital Financial Holdings, Inc., as filed
with the SEC. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 2015, contained herein, was derived from audited financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures included in the
Form 10-K and applicable under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, but not
required for interim reporting purposes, have been condensed or
omitted. 

In the
opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (which
are of a normal, recurring nature) necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial statements. The results of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily
indicative of operating results for the entire year. 

Oil and Gas Properties 

CNR follows the full cost method of accounting for crude oil and
natural gas operations whereby all costs related to the exploration
and development of crude oil and natural gas properties are
capitalized into a single cost center ( full cost
pool ).  Such costs include land acquisition costs,
geological and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on
non-producing properties, costs of drilling directly related to
acquisition, and exploration activities.  

Proceeds from property sales will generally be credited to the full
cost pool with no gain or loss recognized, unless such a sale would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
the proved reserves attributable to these
costs.   

Capitalized costs are depleted and amortized on the
unit-of-production method based on the estimated proved reserves as
determined by independent petroleum engineers.  The costs
of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until
such time as they are either developed or
abandoned.  When proved reserves are assigned or the
property is considered to be impaired, the cost of the property or
the amount of the impairment is added to costs subject to depletion
and full cost ceiling calculations.  For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, depletion expense was $3,301
and $13,743 respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, CNR held leasehold interests on acreage
located in Taylor and Gonzales County, Texas, Lincoln County,
Colorado and Divide and Williams County, North Dakota. CNR
holds  non-operating working interest in the Kifer Rozella 1,
producing oil well, located in the County of Gonzales, state of
Texas and non-operating working interest in an oil and gas property
consisting of three oil and gas leases in Taylor County, Texas. The
oil and gas leases in North Dakota and Colorado are currently
non-producing properties and non-operating leases. 

The Company assesses all items classified as unproved property on
an annual basis, or if certain circumstances exist, more
frequently, for possible impairment or reduction in
value.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company held
non-producing and unproved properties in Lincoln County, Colorado
and Divide and Williams County, North Dakota. 

Oil and Gas Revenue 

The
Company recognizes oil and gas revenue for only its ownership
percentage of total production under the entitlement method. There
was no imbalance as of September 30, 2016. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

Asset retirement obligation is included in other noncurrent
liabilities and relates to future costs associated with the
plugging and abandonment of crude oil and natural gas wells,
removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and
returning the land to its original condition.  Estimates
are based on estimated remaining lives of those wells based on
reserve estimates, external estimates to plug and abandon the wells
in the future, inflation, credit adjusted discount rates and
federal and state regulatory requirements.  The liability
is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset.  As of September 30, 2016, asset retirement
obligations were $2,907 and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 accretion expense was not
significant.

ASU
2016-15  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments    The Company is currently assessing the
potential impact on the company. This amendment becomes effective
for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017. The pronouncement would impact the presentation of certain
items on the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or
debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero coupon debt
instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a
business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims and/or corporate-owned life insurance policies,
distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and separately
identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance
principle. Should the Company have any of the aforementioned items,
they would be presented on the statement of cash flows in
accordance to ASU 2016-15. Early adoption is permitted, but the
entity must adopt all of the amendments in the same
period. 

NOTE 3   BUSINESS VENTURES 

On June
9, 2014, the Company launched a new wholly-owned operating
subsidiary, Capital Natural Resources, Inc., by acquiring 1,000,000
shares, .001 par value common stock of Capital Natural Resources,
Inc. ( CNR ) for the amount of $100,000. Capital
Natural Resources, Inc. will seek opportunities related to natural
resources in the United States, including petroleum, natural gas
and/or other minerals, water resources and land. The new subsidiary
is expected to diversifythe business operations of the Company and
is unrelated to any current or past business. On June 17, 2014, the
Company acquired an additional 400,000 shares, .001 par value
common stock of CNR for the amount of $40,000. On July 21, 2014,
the Company acquired an additional 3,750,000 shares, .001 par value
of common stock of CNR for the amount of $375,000. On September 21,
2016 CNR issued a payment of $214,600 to the Company in exchange
for redemption of 2,146,000 shares, .001 par value of common stock
of CNR As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned 3,004,000 shares
of CNR as CNR s sole shareholder. 

On
April 1, 2015, CNR obtained a non-operating working interest in an
oil and gas property consisting of three oil and gas leases in
Taylor County, Texas for a purchase price of $90,000 paid in cash.
This purchase is presented as oil and natural gas properties on the
balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016, oil and gas revenues were
$46,472. 

On
December 1, 2015, CNR purchased a non-operating working interest in
the Kifer Rozella 1, producing oil well, located in the County of
Gonzales, state of Texas. The purchase price of $100,000 for
CNR s interest was paid by $50,000 by a promissory note and
deed of trust carried by the Seller, Origin Production Company,
Inc. Said promissory note has an annual interest rate of 10% per
annum and is payable in monthly installment of approximately $1,062
beginning January 1, 2016 with final maturity on December 1, 2020.
This purchase is presented as oil and natural gas properties on the
balance sheet. On February 1, 2016 the Company paid off the
promissory note in the amount of approximately $50,847 bringing the
balance of the note to zero. Total interest paid on the promissory
note was approximately $847.  

On July
28, 2015, CNR acquired five year oil and gas leases located in
Williams County, North Dakota and two located in Divide County,
North Dakota for a combined acquisition cost of $7,676, including
lease bonus and prepaid annual rentals. The oil and gas leases were
obtained from the State of North Dakota Department of Trust Lands.
The leases grant the right to conduct oil and gas operations and
extract oil and gas from the property with payment of royalty to
the lessor of 3/16 of oil and gas produced. The leases will expire
August 3, 2020 unless held by production, meaning oil and gas is
being produced from the properties. 

On
August 20, 2015, CNR acquired a five year oil and gas lease located
in Lincoln County, Colorado at an initial acquisition cost of
$1,652 including the first annual rental payment of $1,600. The oil
and gas lease was obtained from the Colorado State Board of Land
Commissioners. The lease grants the right to conduct oil and gas
operations and extract oil and gas from the property with payment
of royalty to the lessor of 1/6 of oil and gas produced. The lease
will expire August 20, 2020 unless held by production, meaning oil
and gas is being produced from the property. 

The oil
and gas leases in North Dakota and Colorado are currently
non-producing properties and non-operating leases. 

The
purchase allocation for all four CNR oil and gas lease transactions
was based on the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired. 

On May
19, 2015, CNR acquired interests in coal rights located in Kanawha
County, West Virginia for a purchase price of $1,275 paid in cash.
This purchase is presented as other property holdings on the
balance sheet. 

On June
11, 2015, CNR acquired mineral, water rights and surface interests
in Hudspeth County, Texas for a purchase price of $83,350 paid in
cash. This purchase is presented as other property holdings on the
balance sheet.

NOTE 5   LINE OF CREDIT 

On July
14, 2014, the Company signed new loan documents for a line of
credit with American Bank Center in the amount of $300,000. The
line of credit had a variable interest rate of 1.509 percent above
Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate. The loan matured July 14,
2015. The Company set up monthly payments with an automatic payment
of $25,000. There are no financial covenants associated with the
line of credit. The Company made a payment of $25,000 on July 6,
2015, and a final payment of $28,578 on July 14, 2015, bringing the
balance to zero. The total interest expense on this line of credit
was $8,061. 

On July
14, 2015, the Company signed renewal loan documents for the line of
credit with American Bank Center in the amount of $500,000. The
line of credit has a variable interest rate of 1.509 percent above
Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate. The loan matured with
principal due on July 14, 2016. For the period ended September 30,
2016, the Company had no outstanding balance against this line of
credit before renewal. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
zero outstanding and zero interest expense against its current line
of credit. There are no financial covenants associated with the
line of credit. 

On
September 12, 2016, the Company signed renewal loan documents for
the line of credit with American Bank Center in the amount of
$500,000. The line of credit has a variable interest rate of 1.509
percent above Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate which was 3.5% as
of September 30, 2016. The loan matures with principal due on
September 12, 2017. For the period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company had no outstanding balance against this line of credit
before renewal. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had zero
outstanding and zero interest expense against its current line of
credit. There are no financial covenants associated with the line
of credit. 

NOTE 6 -   STOCK WARRANTS,
STOCK SPLITS, AND STOCK OPTIONS  

The
Company measures and records compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors,
including employee stock options, based on estimated fair values.
There were no compensation costs or deferred tax benefits
recognized for stock-based compensation awards for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Changes are due to the stock
buyback and reverse stock split. 

Option
activity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

Exercisable
options totaled 207 at December 31, 2015 and totaled 169 at
September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 7   INCOME TAXES 

Deferred
taxes arise because of different tax treatment between financial
statement accounting and tax accounting, known as  temporary
differences.  The Company records the tax effect of these
temporary differences as  deferred tax assets 
(generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in
future periods) and  deferred tax liabilities 
(generally items for which the Company has received a tax deduction
and has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of
operations). 

10 

Management
reviews and adjusts those estimates annually based upon the most
current information available. However, because the recoverability
of deferred taxes is directly dependent upon the future operating
results of the Company, actual recoverability of deferred taxes may
differ materially from management s estimates. 

Due to
stock options forfeited, the deferred tax assets associated with
stock compensation valued under the Black Scholes model were
reduced. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $10,819 was
recorded as tax expense for the quarter and an accumulated amount
of approximately $431,278 has been recorded as tax expense since
the start of stock options being forfeited in March of
2014. 

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were different from the statutory rate
primarily due to the reduction of the deferred tax assets related
to stock compensation.   

NOTE 8 - EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
per share amounts that would have resulted if dilutive potential
common shares had been converted to common shares. The following
reconciles amounts reported in the financial
statements: 

Options
and warrants to purchase 379 common shares at exercise prices
between $3,500 and $14,300 were outstanding at September 30, 2016,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015, because their effect was anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 9   SEGMENT REPORTING 

The
Company organizes its current business units into three reportable
segments: broker dealer services, natural resources and holding
company. The broker-dealer services segment distributes securities
and insurance products to retail investors through a network of
registered representatives through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Capital Financial Services, Inc. ( CFS ), a Wisconsin
corporation. The natural resources segment seeks opportunities
related to natural resources in the United States, including
petroleum, natural gas and/or other minerals, water resources and
land through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Natural
Resources, Inc. ( CNR ), a Colorado corporation. The
holding company encompasses cost associated with business
development and acquisitions, dispositions of subsidiary entities
and results of discontinued operations, dividend income and
recognized gains or losses. 

11 

The
Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that
offer different products and services. They are managed separately
because each business requires different technology and marketing
strategies. 

12 

NOTE 10   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes
it to potentially significant litigation risks. Issuers of certain
alternative products sold by the Company are in Bankruptcy or may
have other financial difficulties. As a result of such alleged
failings of alternative products and the uncertainty of client
recovery from the various product issuers, the Company is subject
to several legal and/or arbitration proceedings. These proceedings
include customer suits and arbitrations related to the failure of
Medical Capital, other alternative investments alleged to be
unsuitable, the bankruptcy proceedings of the various DBSI entities
and the bankruptcy of other various entities. The Company
vigorously contests the allegations of the various proceedings and
believes that there are multiple meritorious legal and fact based
defenses in these matters. Such cases are subject to many
uncertainties, and their outcome is often difficult to predict,
including the impact on operations or on the financial statements,
particularly in the earlier stages of a case. The Company makes
provisions for cases brought against it when, in the opinion of
management after seeking legal advice, it is probable that a
liability exists, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The
current proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as such, the
Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
that may result from the outcome of these cases; however, results
in these cases that are against the interests of the Company could
have a severe negative impact on the financial position of the
Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is a defendant in
two on-going suits or arbitrations as discussed above. The Company
expects to vigorously defend these cases. 

13 

On April 5, 2011, several broker-dealers and their
principals/officers, including the Company and John Carlson,
President and Chief Compliance Officer, filed a lawsuit in the
Superior Court of California for Orange County against Mayer
Hoffman McCann, P.C. ( Mayer Hoffman ) captioned
Signature Financial Group, Inc., et al, ( Signature )
v. Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C., et al.  The lawsuit arose out
of reviews of the financial statements of Medical Capital Holdings,
Inc. ( Medical Capital ) by Mayer Hoffman.  In
June 2009, Medical Capital was sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC  or
 Commission ), a finding was made that Medical Capital
was conducting a  Ponzi scheme,  and a receiver was
appointed to liquidate Medical Capital.  The plaintiffs in the
Signature lawsuit are broker-dealers and principals of
broker-dealers that sold Medical Capital investments to their
clients.  These plaintiffs sought to recover damages from
Mayer Hoffman for the losses and expenses they incurred as a result
of the Medical Capital financial deceptions and resulting expenses
and losses to the plaintiffs.  Specific claims asserted and
relief requested included fraud-intentional misrepresentation of
fact/concealment of fact, negligent misrepresentation, equitable
indemnity, and declaratory relief.  On September 23, 2014, the
Plaintiffs entered into a Confidential Settlement and Mutual
Release Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with
Mayer Hoffman and entities affiliated with Mayer Hoffman to settle
the Plaintiffs  claims against Mayer Hoffman and all
affiliated parties of Mayer Hoffman with no admission of liability
or fault by any defendant.  The settlement proceeds were
received on December 4, 2014 and recorded as other income on the
consolidated financial statements of Capital Financial 
Holdings, Inc.  In a matter related to the Settlement
Agreement, on or about October 6, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit
seeking declaratory judgment against its former errors and omission
insurance carrier - Arch Specialty Insurance Company
( Arch ) - in the Circuit Court of Wisconsin for
Milwaukee County (Capital Financial Services, Inc. v. Arch
Specialty Insurance Company).  On or about November 24, 2014,
Arch filed counterclaims against the Company. These actions were
for declaratory relief in connection with a dispute over whether
Arch is entitled to any portion of the settlement proceeds that the
Company received in exchange for dismissing the lawsuit with Mayer
Hoffman.  On September 14, 2016 the Company and Arch agreed to
settle all claims between them in exchange for a $82,500 payment by
the Company to Arch which was accrued at September 30, 2016. On
October 24, 2016 the court ordered the case, including all claims,
counterclaims, and third party claims dismissed with prejudice in
accordance with the settlement agreement.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

GENERAL 

Capital
Financial Holdings, Inc. derives the majority of its revenues and
net income from sales of mutual funds, insurance products, and
various other securities through Capital Financial Services, Inc.
( CFS ), the Company s broker dealer
segment. 

The
Company has been engaged in the financial services business since
1987. The Company was incorporated September 22, 1987, as a North
Dakota corporation. The Company s principal offices are
located at 1 Main Street North, Minot, North Dakota 58703. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had 19 full-time employees
consisting of officers, principals, data processing, compliance,
accounting, and clerical support staff. 

The
Company organizes its current business units into three reportable
segments: broker dealer services, natural resources and holding
company. The broker-dealer services segment distributes securities
and insurance products to retail investors through a network of
registered representatives through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Capital Financial Services, Inc. ( CFS ), a Wisconsin
corporation. The natural resources segment seeks opportunities
related to natural resources in the United States, including
petroleum, natural gas and/or other minerals, water resources and
land through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Natural
Resources, Inc. ( CNR ), a Colorado corporation. The
holding company encompasses cost associated with business
development and acquisitions, dispositions of subsidiary entities
and results of discontinued operations, dividend income and
recognized gains or losses. 

The
Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that
offer different products and services. They are managed separately
because each business requires different technology and marketing
strategies. 

Capital
Financial Holdings, Inc. derives the majority of its revenues and
net income from sales of mutual funds, insurance products, and
various other securities through Capital Financial Services, Inc.
( CFS ), the Company s broker dealer
segment. 

CFS is
a full-service brokerage firm. CFS is registered with the SEC as an
investment advisor and broker-dealer and also with FINRA as a
broker-dealer. CFS specializes in providing investment products and
services to independent investment representatives, financial
planners, and investment advisors and currently supports over
175   investment
representatives and investment advisors. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

15 

The
Company reported net income for the three months ended September
30, 2016, of $44,740, compared to net income of $36,254 for the

the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of
$30,608 during the same period in 2015. The increase in net income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net
income in the same period in 2015 is due to increased operating
revenues of approximately $189,000. The increased net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss in the
same period in 2015 is due primarily to decreased revenues of
approximately $1,033,000 and increased compensation and benefits
expenses of approximately $115,000.

and debt instruments, as well as bank loans, for liquidity and
growth. Management believes that the Company s existing
liquid assets, along with cash flow from operations, will provide
the Company with sufficient resources to meet its ordinary
operating expenses during the next twelve months. Significant,
unforeseen or extraordinary expenses may require the Company to
seek alternative financing sources, including common or preferred
share issuance or additional debt financing. 

In
addition to the liabilities coming due in the next twelve months,
management expects that the principal needs for cash may be broker
recruitment, repurchase of shares of the Company s common
stock, and debt service. Management also expects to realize
increases in consultant expenses as well as increased compliance
and legal costs with respect to its broker dealer subsidiary
related to regulatory and litigation matters.

Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, including the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14(c)
and Rule 15c-14(c) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the
period covered by this report, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the
Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as
of September 30, 2016, and that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed and summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules
and forms. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

There
were no significant changes in the Company s internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. 

We are not currently a  listed company  under SEC rules
and are therefore not required to have a board comprised of a
majority of independent directors or separate committees comprised
of independent directors.  We use the definition of
 independence  under the NASDAQ Rules, as applicable
and as may be modified or supplemented from time to time and the
interpretations thereunder, to determine if the members of our
Board are independent.  In making this determination, our
Board considers, among other things, transactions and relationships
between each director and his immediate family and us, including
those reported in its Annual Report under the caption
 Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions.   The purpose of this review is to
determine whether any such relationships or transactions are
material and, therefore, inconsistent with a determination that the
directors are independent.  On the basis of such review
and its understanding of such relationships and transactions, our
Board has determined that none of our Board members is an
independent director.
