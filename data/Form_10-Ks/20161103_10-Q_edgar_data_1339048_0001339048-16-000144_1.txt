Table of Contents  

Explanatory Note 
  This report on Form 10-Q is a combined report being filed separately by Western Refining, Inc. ( Western ) and Northern Tier Energy LP ( NTI ). Western owns all of the common units of NTI and NTI meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is therefore filing its information within this Form 10-Q with the reduced disclosure format. NTI's debt is in the form of senior secured notes due in 2020 and the indenture governing NTI's senior secured notes requires that it publicly disclose its quarterly financial position, results of operations and cash flows through the maturity date or retirement of its senior secured notes. Western and NTI have elected to include NTI's statements of financial position, results of operations, statements of cash flows and corresponding notes to its consolidated financial statements for all periods required within a separate section of Western's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Each of Western and NTI is filing on its own behalf the information contained in this report that relates to itself, and neither entity makes any representation as to information relating to the other entity. Where information or an explanation is provided that is substantially the same for each entity, such information or explanation has been combined in this report. Where information or an explanation is not substantially the same for each entity, separate information and explanation has been provided. 
    
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  As provided by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, certain statements included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in particular under the section entitled   Part I   Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   relating to matters that are not historical fact should be deemed forward-looking statements that represent management s beliefs and assumptions based upon currently available information. These forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, including the regulation of our industry, business strategy, future operations, our expectations for margins and crack spreads, seasonality, the discount between West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil and Dated Brent crude oil as well as the discount between WTI Cushing and WTI Midland crude oils, volatility of crude oil prices, additions to pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin and at Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline access to advantaged crude oil, expected share repurchases and dividends, volatility in pricing of Renewable Identification Numbers ("RIN"), taxes, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information. Forward-looking statements also include those regarding the timing of completion of certain operational and maintenance improvements we are making at our refineries, future operational and refinery efficiencies and cost savings, timing of future maintenance turnarounds, the amount or sufficiency of future cash flows and earnings growth, future expenditures, future contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, our ability to manage our inventory price exposure through commodity hedging instruments, the impact upon our business of existing and future state and federal regulatory requirements, environmental loss contingency accruals, projected remediation costs or requirements and the expected outcomes of legal proceedings in which we are involved. We have used the words  anticipate,   assume,   believe,   budget,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   may,   plan,   position,   potential,   predict,   project,   strategy,   will,   future  and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this report.  
  Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results or outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect or that are affected by unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many that are beyond our control, that could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of factors. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all of these factors, they include, among others, the following: 
             
    our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with NTI; 
                
    availability, costs and price volatility of crude oil, other refinery feedstocks and refined products;

    the impact on us of increased levels and cost of indebtedness used to fund our merger with NTI or the cash portion of the merger consideration and increased cost of existing indebtedness due to the actions taken to consummate the merger with NTI; 
                
    our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms to fund additional acquisitions, expansion projects, working capital requirements and the repayment or refinancing of indebtedness; 
                
    changes in crack spreads;

    labor relations; 
                
    operating hazards, natural disasters, casualty losses, acts of terrorism including cyber-attacks and other matters beyond our control; and 
      Any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and could influence whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating any forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon these forward-looking statements.  
  Although we believe the forward-looking statements we make in this report related to our plans, intentions and expectations are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. These statements are based upon assumptions made by us based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date of this report and we are not required to (and will not) update any information to reflect events or circumstances that may occur after the date of this report, except as required by applicable law.

  (Unaudited) 

1.    Organization    
  "Western," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Western Refining, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries. Western Refining, Inc. was formed on September 16, 2005, as a holding company prior to our initial public offering and is incorporated in Delaware. 
  We produce refined products at our refineries in El Paso, Texas, Gallup, New Mexico and St. Paul Park, Minnesota. We sell refined products in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West Texas, the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico. Our product sales occur through bulk distribution terminals, wholesale marketing networks and   two   retail networks with a total of   545   company-owned and franchised retail sites in the United States. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we own   100%   of the limited partner interest in Northern Tier Energy LP ("NTI") and   100%   of its general partner.   We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2015 (the  Merger Agreement ), with Western Acquisition Co, LLC ( MergerCo ) which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, to acquire all of NTI s outstanding common units not already held by us (the  Merger ). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger Agreement by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed.   We incurred   $500 million     of additional secured indebtedness under our amended term loan credit agreement to partially fund the Merger consideration.   See   Note 9, Long-Term Debt  , and   Note 21, Acquisitions  , for further discussion. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   52.6%   limited partner interest in Western Refining Logistics, LP ("WNRL" or the "Partnership") and the public held a   47.4%   limited partner interest. We control WNRL through our   100%   ownership of its general partner and we own the majority of WNRL's limited partnership interests. WNRL owns and operates logistics assets consisting of pipeline and gathering, terminalling, storage and transportation assets as well a wholesale business that operates primarily in the Southwest. WNRL operates its logistics assets primarily for the benefit of the Company.  
  On   September 15, 2016  , we sold certain assets consisting of terminals, transportation and storage assets and the related land located on site at our St. Paul Park refinery and Cottage Grove tank farm to WNRL. These assets primarily receive, store and distribute crude oil, feedstock and refined products associated with the St. Paul Park refinery (the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  "). WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange for   $195.0 million   in cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. We refer to this transaction as the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  ."  
  On   September 7, 2016  , WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale of   7,500,000   of its common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. 
  On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by WNRL of     3,750,000     common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to     562,500     additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully exercised the option on June 1, 2016. 
  On October 30, 2015, we sold a   375   mile segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system to WNRL. This segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline extends from WNRL's crude oil station in Star Lake, New Mexico, in the Four Corners region to its T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the "  TexNew Mex Pipeline System  "). We also sold an   80,000   barrel crude oil storage tank located at WNRL's crude oil pumping station in Star Lake, New Mexico and certain other related assets. WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange for   $170 million   in cash,   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   units of a newly created class of limited partner interests in WNRL, referred to as the "TexNew Mex Units." We refer to this transaction as the "  TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction  ." 
  The WNRL financial and operational data presented includes the historical results of all assets acquired from Western in the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction. The acquisitions from Western were a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information contained herein for WNRL has been retrospectively adjusted, to include the historical results of the assets acquired, for periods prior to the effective date of the transactions. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we changed our reportable segments due to changes in our organization. Our operations include   three   business segments: refining, WNRL and retail. See   Note 3, Segment Information  , for further discussion of our business segments.

2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim consolidated financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  , or for any other period. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015  , has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Western and our subsidiaries. We own   100%   of NTI's general partner and, subsequent to the Merger, we own   100%   of the limited partner interest in NTI. We own a   52.6%   limited partner interest in WNRL and   100%   of WNRL's general partner. As the general partner of WNRL, we have the ability to direct the activities of WNRL that most significantly impact their respective economic performance. We have reported a non-controlling interest for WNRL as of   September 30, 2016  , of   $602.0 million   and non-controlling interests for NTI and WNRL of   $1,646.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated for all periods presented. Investments in significant non-controlled entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. 
  Variable Interest Entity 
   WNRL is a variable interest entity ("VIE") as defined under GAAP. A VIE is a legal entity whose equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the equity holders lack the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's financial performance, the obligation to absorb the entity's expected losses or rights to expected residual returns. As the general partner of WNRL, we have the sole ability to direct the activities of WNRL that most significantly impact WNRL's financial performance, and therefore we consolidate WNRL. See   Note 22, WNRL  , for further discussion. 
  Goodwill and Other Unamortizable Intangible Assets  
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price (cost) over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is carried at cost. We do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. Our policy is to test goodwill and other unamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually at June 30, or more frequently if indications of impairment exist. 
  The risk of goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses may increase to the extent that results of operations or cash flows decline at our St. Paul Park refinery or SuperAmerica operating segments. Impairment losses may result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or intangible assets. Furthermore, impairment losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and shareholders  equity. 
  Use of Estimates and Seasonality 
  The preparation of financial statements, in accordance with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. During 2014, 2015 and continuing into 2016, the volatility in crude oil prices and refining margins contributed to the variability of our results of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the revised accounting and reporting requirements included in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") for consolidation of limited partnerships or similar entities. We have applied the new standards retrospectively. The adoption of these revised standards did not result in any change to our consolidation conclusions or impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have added disclosures for WNRL as required for entities not previously included in the reporting entity as a variable interest entity. 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related reporting and disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
             
    Recognition and reporting of revenues - the requirements were amended to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The revised standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised standard also addresses principal versus agent considerations and indicators related to transfer of control over specified goods. These provisions are effective January 1, 2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  
                
    Lease accounting - the requirements were amended with regard to recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing information about leasing arrangements. The core principle is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.    
                
    Employee share-based payment accounting - the requirements involve several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification in the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. These provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. 
                
    Cash flow statement - the requirements address certain classification issues related to the statement of cash flows. These provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.    
                
    Recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products - the requirements align recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products with the revenue recognition standard discussed above for non-financial liabilities. Certain of these liabilities may be extinguished proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. 
                
    Contingent put and call options in debt instruments - the requirements will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments and clarify the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the  clearly and closely  criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. 
      
  3.    Segment Information 
  We have organized our operations into   three     segments, refining, WNRL and retail, based on manufacturing and marketing processes, the nature of our products and services and each segment's respective customer base. Prior to the Merger on June 23, 2016, we also reported NTI as a separate reportable segment. Following the completion of the Merger, NTI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western and, as a result, we have moved its assets and operations into our other reportable segments. Beginning on July 1, 2016, our management team, led by our chief operating decision maker, began monitoring our business and allocating resources based on these   three     reportable segments. The St. Paul Park refinery and related operations are now included in the refining segment and the SuperAmerica retail and bakery assets and operations are now included in the retail

segment. We have retrospectively adjusted the historical segment financial data for the periods presented to reflect our revised segment presentation. 
  We treated the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the   TexNew Mex Pipeline System   that we sold to WNRL as a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Accordingly, we have retrospectively adjusted the financial information for the affected reporting segments to include or exclude the historical results of the transferred assets for periods prior to the effective date of the transaction. We moved the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the   TexNew Mex Pipeline System   from the refining segment to the WNRL segment. 
  Business Segments and Principal Products 
  Refining  . Our refining segment includes the operations of   three   refineries. The El Paso refinery in El Paso, Texas, has a throughput capacity of   131,000   barrels per day ("bpd"), the Gallup refinery, near Gallup, New Mexico has a   25,000   bpd capacity and the St. Paul Park refinery, in St. Paul Park, Minnesota has a   98,000   bpd capacity. Our refineries produce various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel and other products from crude oil, other feedstocks and blending components. We purchase crude oil, other feedstocks and blending components from third-party suppliers. We also acquire refined products through exchange agreements and from third-party suppliers to supplement supply to our customers. We sell these products to WNRL, to our retail segment, to other independent wholesalers and retailers, through commercial accounts and sales and exchanges with major oil companies.  
  We have an exclusive supply and marketing agreement with a third party, covering activities related to our refined product supply, sales and hedging in the Mid-Atlantic region. We recorded   $4.0 million   and   $1.8 million   in   assets   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to this supply agreement in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The revenues and costs recorded under the supply agreement included   $6.1 million   and   $23.3 million   in net hedging   gains   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   gains   of   $32.1 million   and   $39.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   This supply agreement is due to expire at the end of 2016. 
  WNRL.   WNRL owns and operates pipeline and gathering, terminalling, storage and transportation assets that provide logistics services to our refining segment in the Southwest and Upper Great Plains regions, including   692   miles of pipelines and   12.4 million   barrels of active storage capacity. The majority of WNRL's logistics assets are integral to the operations of the El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park refineries. 
  WNRL also owns a wholesale business that operates primarily in the Southwest. WNRL's wholesale business includes the operations of several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of crude oil, refined product, asphalt and lubricant delivery trucks. WNRL distributes commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. WNRL purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from our refining segment and from third-party suppliers. 
  Retail  . Our retail segment operates retail networks located in the Southwest region ("  Southwest Retail  ") and the Upper Great Plains region of the U.S. ("  SuperAmerica  "). Each of our retail networks sell various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, convenience store merchandise and beverage and food products to the general public through retail convenience stores.  
  Southwest Retail   obtains the majority of its gasoline and diesel fuel supply from WNRL and purchases general merchandise and beverage and food products from various third-party suppliers. At   September 30, 2016  , Southwest Retail operated   260   service stations and convenience stores located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas compared to   261   service stations and convenience stores at   September 30, 2015  . In addition to its service stations and convenience stores, Southwest Retail sells various grades of gasoline and diesel fuel to commercial vehicle fleets through unmanned fleet fueling sites ("cardlocks"). At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, Southwest Retail operated   51   and   52   cardlocks located in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , SuperAmerica operated   170   retail convenience stores and supported the operations of   115   franchised retail convenience stores primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin, compared to   165   and   102   at   September 30, 2015  .   SuperAmerica   obtains the majority of its gasoline and diesel for its Minnesota and Wisconsin retail convenience stores from the St. Paul Park refinery.  
  Segment Accounting Principles.   Operating income for each segment consists of net revenues less cost of products sold; direct operating expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net impact of the disposal of assets and depreciation and amortization. The refining segment also includes costs related to periodic maintenance turnaround activities. Cost of products sold includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to our commodity hedging activities and reflects current costs adjusted, where appropriate, for "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO") and lower of cost or market ("LCM") inventory adjustments. Intersegment revenues are reported at prices that approximate market.

Activities of our business that are not included in the   three   segments mentioned above are included in the Other category. These activities consist primarily of corporate staff operations and other items that are not specific to the normal business of any one of our   three   operating segments. We do not allocate certain items of other income and expense, including income taxes, to the individual segments.  
  The total assets of each segment consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents; inventories; net accounts receivable; net property, plant and equipment and other assets directly associated with the individual segment s operations. Included in the total assets of the corporate operations are cash and cash equivalents; various net accounts receivable; prepaid expenses; other current assets; net property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets. 
  Disclosures regarding our reportable segments with reconciliations to consolidated totals for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are presented below:

    The effect of our economic hedging activity is included within the operating income of our refining segment as a component of cost of products sold. The cost of products sold within our refining segment included   $0.1 million   in net realized and unrealized economic hedging   gains   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $8.6 million   in net realized and unrealized economic hedging   losses   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $27.2 million   and   $10.3 million   in net realized and unrealized economic hedging   gains   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Also included within cost of products sold for our refining segment is the net effect of non-cash LCM recoveries of   $15.2 million   and   $102.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, charges of   $36.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and recoveries of   $17.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
              (2) 
    WNRL's financial data includes its historical financial results and an allocated portion of corporate general and administrative expenses, previously reported as Other, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The information contained herein for WNRL has been retrospectively adjusted, to include the historical results of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the   TexNew Mex Pipeline System  . 
      
  4.    Fair Value Measurement    
  We utilize the market approach when measuring fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 
  The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 
           Level 1 
    Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
              Level 2 
    Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
              Level 3 
    Inputs are derived from valuation techniques that one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs. 
     The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, which we consider Level 1 assets and liabilities, approximated their fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , due to their short-term maturities. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term duration of the instruments and an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. Cash equivalents totaling   $0.02 million   and   $70.1 million   consisting of short-term money market deposits and commercial paper were included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We maintain cash deposits with various counterparties in support of our hedging and trading activities. These deposits are required by counterparties as collateral and cannot be offset against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default. Certain of our commodity derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability

positions. We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the column "Netting Adjustments" below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the tables below. See   Note 13, Crude Oil and Refined Product Risk Management  , for further discussion of master netting arrangements. 
  The following tables represent our assets and liabilities for our commodity hedging contracts measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the basis for that measurement:   

Commodity hedging contracts designated as Level 3 financial assets consisted of jet fuel crack spread swaps. Ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") pricing has had a strong historical correlation to jet fuel crack spread swaps. We estimate the fair value of our Level 3 instruments based on the differential between quoted market settlement prices on ULSD futures and quoted market settlement prices on jet fuel futures for settlement dates corresponding to each of our outstanding Level 3 jet fuel crack spread swaps. As quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market are available, we reclassify the underlying financial asset or liability and designate them as Level 2 prior to final settlement.  
  Carrying amounts of commodity hedging contracts reflected as financial assets are included in both current and non-current other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Carrying amounts of commodity hedging contracts reflected as financial liabilities are included in both accrued and other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value adjustments referred to as credit valuation adjustments ("CVA") are included in the carrying amounts of commodity hedging contracts. CVAs are intended to adjust the fair value of counterparty contracts as a function of a counterparty's credit rating and reflect the credit quality of each counterparty to arrive at contract fair values.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill (all related to commodity price swap contracts) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

A hypothetical change of 10% to the estimated future cash flows attributable to our Level 3 commodity price swaps would result in a   $0.1 million   change in the estimated fair value at   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our debt was as follows: 

The carrying amount of our debt is the amount reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the current portion. The fair value of the debt was determined using Level 2 inputs. 
  There have been   no   transfers between assets or liabilities whose fair value is determined through the use of quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and those determined through the use of significant other observable inputs (Level 2).

5.    Inventories    
  Inventories were as follows:   

   We value our refinery inventories of crude oil, other raw materials and asphalt at the lower of cost or market under the LIFO valuation method. Other than refined products inventories held by WNRL and in Southwest Retail, refined products inventories are valued under the LIFO valuation method. WNRL's wholesale refined product, lubricants and related inventories are valued using the FIFO inventory valuation method. In our retail segment, refined product inventory is valued using the FIFO inventory valuation method for Southwest Retail and the LIFO inventory valuation method for SuperAmerica. Retail merchandise inventory is valued using the retail inventory method. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , refined products valued under the LIFO method and crude oil and other raw materials totaled   10.4 million   barrels and   10.0 million   barrels, respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   the excess of the LIFO cost over the current cost of these crude oil, refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories was     $193.3 million   and   $198.4 million  , respectively. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cost of products sold included net non-cash   recoveries   of   $79.5 million   and   $105.0 million  , respectively, from changes in our LIFO reserves. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cost of products sold included net non-cash   charges   of   $5.1 million   and net non-cash   recoveries   of   $129.0 million  , respectively, from changes in our LIFO reserves.  
  In order to state our inventories at market values that were lower than our LIFO costs, we reduced the carrying values of our inventory through non-cash LCM inventory adjustments of   $72.6 million   and   $175.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These non-cash LCM recoveries decreased cost of products sold by   $15.2 million   and   $102.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and by   $17.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The non-cash LCM charge for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , increased cost of products sold by   $36.8 million  . 
  Average LIFO cost per barrel of our refined products and crude oil and other raw materials inventories as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

6.    Equity Method Investment    
  We own a   17%   common equity interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC ("MPL"). The carrying value of this equity method investment was   $98.2 million   and   $97.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the equity method investment was   $21.2 million   and   $21.3 million  , respectively, higher than the underlying net assets of the investee. We are amortizing this

difference over the remaining life of MPL s primary asset (the fixed asset life of the pipeline). There is no market for the common units of MPL and, accordingly,   no   quoted market price is available.  
  We received distributions from MPL during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , of   $10.2 million  ,   $14.5 million  ,   $4.2 million   and   $10.0 million  , respectively. Equity income from MPL for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $5.3 million  ,   $15.3 million  ,   $4.2 million   and   $12.0 million  , respectively. Equity income has been included in other, net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Depreciation expense was   $53.3 million   and   $158.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $50.4 million   and   $149.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  8.    Intangible Assets, Net    
  Intangible assets, net was as follows: 

Intangible asset amortization expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $0.7 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, based on estimated useful lives ranging from   1   to   35   years. Intangible asset amortization expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, based on estimated useful lives ranging from   1   to   23   years.

Interest and debt expense   were as follows: 

We amortize original issue discounts and financing fees using the effective interest method over the respective term of the debt. Our creditors have no recourse to the assets owned by either of NTI or WNRL, and the creditors of NTI and WNRL have no recourse to our assets or those of our other subsidiaries. 
  Western Obligations 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  On May 27, 2016, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Amendment amended the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility by, among other things, (i) permitting us to incur up to   $500.0 million   of additional secured indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the loans under the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility (in the form of incremental term loans or bonds secured on a pari passu basis with the term loans) beyond what was permitted under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) modifying several triggers and thresholds based on borrowing availability under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. 
  On October 2, 2014, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. Lenders committed   $900.0 million  , all of which will mature on   October 2, 2019  . The commitments under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in the future to   $1.4 billion  , subject to certain conditions (including the agreement of financial institutions, in their sole discretion, to provide such additional commitments). The amended terms of the agreement include revised borrowing rates. Borrowings can be either base rate loans plus a margin ranging from   0.50%   to   1.00%   or   LIBOR   loans plus a margin ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%  , subject to adjustment based upon the average excess availability. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a quarterly commitment fee ranging from   0.25%   to   0.375%   per annum, subject to adjustment based upon the average utilization ratio, and letter of credit fees ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%   per annum payable quarterly, subject to adjustment based upon the average excess availability. Borrowing availability under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is tied to the amount of our and our restricted subsidiaries' eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of our subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by certain newly acquired or formed subsidiaries, subject to certain limited exceptions. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is secured by our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, investments and dividends and the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances. 
  As of and during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   direct borrowings under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, with availability of   $257.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This availability is net of   $100.1 million   in outstanding letters of credit.  
  Term Loan Credit Agreement -   5.25%    
  On November 12, 2013, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility"). The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility provides for loans of   $550.0 million  , matures on November 12, 2020, and provides for quarterly principal payments of   $1.4 million   until September 30, 2020, with the remaining balance then

outstanding due on the maturity date. On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment of the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility. The revised terms under the amendment provide for additional capacity to make restricted payments including dividends and repurchase of the Company s outstanding common stock, inclusion of equity interests of master limited partnership subsidiaries as  replacement assets  for purposes of asset sale mandatory prepayment and changes to the use of proceeds of the incremental term loan available under the Term Loan. The third amendment also increased the incremental availability under the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility from   $200.0 million  , prior to the amendment, to   $700.0 million  . 
  Following the third amendment, the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility bears interest at a rate based either on the base rate (as defined in the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility) plus   2.25%   or the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility) plus   4.25%   (subject to a LIBOR Rate floor of   1.00%  ). The current interest rate based on these criteria is   5.25%  . Our effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility was   5.80%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by the El Paso and Gallup refineries and the equity of NT InterHoldCo LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of Western's material wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants including limitations on debt, investments and dividends and does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. 
  6.25%   Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On March 25, 2013, we entered into an indenture (the "Western 2021 Indenture") for the issuance of   $350.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 (the "Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes"). The Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. We pay interest on the Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes mature on April 1, 2021. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes was   6.52%   as of   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 20, Condensed Consolidating Financial Information   for further discussion. 
  Term Loan Credit Agreement -   5.50%    
  On June 23, 2016, as an incremental supplement to the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility, we incurred   $500.0 million   in new term debt that matures on June 23, 2023 (the "  Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility  "). The proceeds from the   Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility   were net of original issue discount and other fees totaling   $17.0 million  . We used these proceeds to partially fund the cash portion of the Merger consideration. The   Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility   provides for quarterly principal payments of   $1.3 million   payable on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the remaining principal amount due on June 23, 2023. The Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by both the El Paso and Gallup refineries and by the equity of NT InterHoldCo LLC and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of Western's material wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility bears interest at a rate based either on the base rate plus   3.50%   or the LIBOR Rate plus   4.50%   (subject to a LIBOR Rate floor of   1.00%  ). The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of original issue discount and other loan fees, for the Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility was   5.99%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  NTI Obligations 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  On September 29, 2014, certain subsidiaries of NTI entered into the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "NTI Revolving Credit Facility"), increasing the aggregate principal amount available prior to the amendment and restatement from   $300.0 million   to   $500.0 million  . The NTI Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on   September 29, 2019  , incorporates a borrowing base tied to eligible accounts receivable and inventory and provides for up to   $500.0 million   for the issuance of letters of credit and up to   $45.0 million   for swing line loans. The NTI Revolving Credit Facility may be increased up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $750.0 million  , subject to certain conditions (including the agreement of financial institutions, in their sole discretion, to provide such additional commitments). Obligations under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of NTI s assets. Indebtedness under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility is recourse to its general partner, Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTI LLC"), and certain of its subsidiaries that are borrowers thereunder and is guaranteed by NTI and certain of its subsidiaries. Borrowings under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between   0.50%   and   1.00%  ) or (b) a   LIBOR   rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between   1.50%   and   2.00%  ), in each case subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings, NTI is also required to pay a quarterly

commitment fee ranging from   0.250%   to   0.375%   subject to adjustment based upon the average utilization ratio and letter of credit fees ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%   subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. The NTI Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on debt, investments and dividends and the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the availability under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility was   $205.7 million  . This availability is net of   $52.0 million   in direct borrowings and   $47.6 million   in outstanding letters of credit. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the NTI Revolving Credit Facility was   5.91%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  7.125%   Secured Notes 
  On November 8, 2012, NTI LLC and Northern Tier Finance Corporation (together with NTI LLC, the "NTI 2020 Notes Issuers"), issued   $275.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.125%   senior secured notes due 2020 (the "  NTI 2020 Secured Notes  "). On October 17, 2016, NTI commenced a tender offer to repurchase for cash up to   $195.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   NTI 2020 Secured Notes  . The tender offer expires on November 15, 2016. 
  NTI increased the principal amount of the NTI 2020 Secured Notes in September 2014, by an additional   $75.0 million   in principal value at a premium of   $4.2 million  . This additional offering was issued under the same indenture as the existing NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the new notes issued have the same terms as the existing notes. The offering generated cash proceeds of   $79.2 million   including an issuance premium of   $4.2 million  . The issuance premium will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of debt premium and of loan fees, for the NTI 2020 Secured Notes was   6.91%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The obligations under the NTI 2020 Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by NTI and on a senior secured basis by (i) all of NTI LLC s restricted subsidiaries that borrow, or guarantee obligations, under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility or any other indebtedness of NTI LLC or another subsidiary of NTI LLC that guarantees the NTI 2020 Secured Notes and (ii) all other material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of NTI LLC. The indenture governing the NTI 2020 Secured Notes contains covenants that limit or restrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries. Indebtedness under the NTI 2020 Secured Notes is guaranteed by NTI and certain of its subsidiaries.  
  WNRL Obligations 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  On October 16, 2013, WNRL entered into a   $300.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility (the "WNRL Revolving Credit Facility"). On September 15, 2016, in connection with the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  , WNRL entered into an agreement to increase the total commitment of the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility (the "Amendment") to   $500.0 million  . WNRL has the ability to increase the total commitment of the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility by up to   $150.0 million   for a total facility size of up to   $650.0 million  , subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders and to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The WNRL Revolving Credit Facility includes a   $25.0 million   sub-limit for standby letters of credit and a   $10.0 million   sub-limit for swing line loans. Obligations under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility and certain cash management and hedging obligations are guaranteed by all of WNRL's subsidiaries and, with certain exceptions, will be guaranteed by any formed or acquired subsidiaries. Obligations under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of WNRL's and its subsidiaries' significant assets. The WNRL Revolving Credit Facility will mature on   October 16, 2018  . Borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   0.75%   to   1.75%  , or at   LIBOR   plus an applicable margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.75%  . The applicable margin will vary based upon WNRL's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility.  
  In addition to the increased facility size, the Amendment amended the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility by, among other things, (a) adding an anti-cash hoarding provision and (b) permitting WNRL to increase the total leverage ratio permitted thereunder from   4.50  :  1.00   to   5.00  :  1.00   following any material permitted acquisition through the last day of the second full fiscal quarter following such acquisition. The incremental commitments established by the Amendment benefit from the same covenants, events of default, guarantees and security as the existing commitments under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility. 
  On October 15, 2014, to partially fund the purchase of certain assets from Western, WNRL borrowed   $269.0 million   under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility and WNRL repaid its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility on February 11, 2015, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of its   7.5%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the "  7.5%   Senior Notes"), discussed below. On October 30, 2015, WNRL borrowed   $145.0 million   under the WNRL Revolving

Credit Facility to partially fund the purchase of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System from Western. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , WNRL repaid   $179.1 million   of its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility using the proceeds generated through our equity issuances during the period. On   September 15, 2016  , to partially fund the purchase of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  , WNRL borrowed   $20.3 million   under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility.  
  The WNRL Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that limit or restrict WNRL's ability to make cash distributions. WNRL is required to maintain certain financial ratios that are tested on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period. At   September 30, 2016  , the availability under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was   $479.0 million  , net of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings and   $0.7 million   in outstanding letters of credit. WNRL had   no   swing line borrowings outstanding under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . The interest rate for the borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was   4.50%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was   3.34%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  7.5%   Senior Notes  
  On February 11, 2015, WNRL entered into an indenture (the  WNRL Indenture ) among WNRL, WNRL Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership ( Finance Corp.  and together with the Partnership, the  Issuers ), the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  Trustee ) under which the Issuers issued   $300.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.5%   Senior Notes due 2023. The Partnership will pay interest on the   7.5%   Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2015. The   7.5%   Senior Notes will mature on February 15, 2023. WNRL used the proceeds from the notes to repay the full balance due under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility on February 11, 2015. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the   7.5%   Senior Notes was   7.78%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The WNRL Indenture contains covenants that limit WNRL s and its restricted subsidiaries  ability to, among other things, (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units, (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness, (iii) pay distributions on equity securities, repurchase equity securities or redeem subordinated indebtedness, (iv) make investments, (v) restrict distributions, loans or other asset transfers from the Partnership s restricted subsidiaries, (vi) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of the Partnership s properties to, another person, (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The WNRL Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all the then outstanding   7.5%   Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.

11.    Income Taxes    
  Compared to the federal statutory rate of   35%  , our effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were   20.9%  ,   26.8%  ,   29.7%   and   27.5%  , respectively. The effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the reduction of taxable income associated with the non-controlling interests in NTI and WNRL. In addition, we released reserves related to uncertain tax positions during the third quarter of 2016. As of June 23, 2016, all of NTI's taxable income became subject to income taxes at the Western consolidated level.  
  We are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years ended December 31, 2013, or after and by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for tax years ended December 31, 2012, or after. 
  We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards related to the Yorktown refinery will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of   $20.8 million   was previously provided against the deferred tax assets relating to these NOL carryforwards at   September 30, 2016  . There was   no   change in the valuation allowance for the Yorktown NOL carryforwards from   December 31, 2015  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have recorded a liability of   $34.5 million   for unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $18.7 million   would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. There was   a decrease   of   $6.7 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively, in our unrecognized tax benefits for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to   $5.6 million   in unrecognized tax benefits, resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations in various tax jurisdictions, may be necessary within the coming year. We also recognized   $0.4 million  ,   $0.9 million  ,   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   in interest and penalties for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  12.    Retirement Plans    
  We fully recognize the obligations associated with our retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans and single-employer defined benefit cash balance plan in our financial statements. 
  Pensions 
  The net periodic benefit cost associated with our cash balance plan for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $0.6 million  ,   $1.8 million  ,   $0.7 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively.  
  Postretirement Obligations 
  The net periodic benefit cost associated with our postretirement medical benefit plans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $0.03 million  ,   $0.1 million  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 
  Our benefit obligation at   December 31, 2015  , for our postretirement medical benefit plans was   $6.2 million  . We fund our medical benefit plans on an as-needed basis.

Defined Contribution Plan 
  Western sponsors defined contribution plans under which Western, NTI and WNRL participants may contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation to various investment choices offered by these plans. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we expensed   $4.5 million  ,   $13.6 million  ,   $4.2 million   and   $12.8 million  , respectively, in connection with these plans.  
   
  13.    Crude Oil and Refined Product Risk Management    
  We enter into crude oil forward contracts primarily to facilitate the supply of crude oil to our refineries. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into net forward, fixed-price contracts to physically receive and deliver crude oil that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales and are exempt from derivative reporting requirements. 
  We use crude oil, refined products and natural gas futures, swap contracts or options to mitigate the change in value for a portion of our LIFO inventory and refinery fuel gas volumes subject to market price fluctuations. We enter into swap contracts to fix differentials on a portion of our future crude oil purchases and to fix margins on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production. The physical volumes are not exchanged; these contracts are net settled with cash. These hedging activities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
  The fair value of these contracts is reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related net gain or loss is recorded within cost of products sold in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 2) are considered to determine the fair values of the majority of the contracts for the purpose of marking the hedging instruments to market at each period end.  
  The following tables summarize our economic hedging activity recognized within cost of products sold for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and open commodity hedging positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
  Western's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements to manage counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives; however, Western does not offset the fair value amounts recorded for derivative instruments under these agreements in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have posted or received margin collateral with various counterparties in support of our hedging and trading activities. The margin collateral posted or received is required by counterparties as collateral deposits and cannot be offset against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default.  
  The following table presents offsetting information regarding Western's commodity hedging contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Our commodity hedging activities are initiated within guidelines established by management and approved by our board of directors. Due to mark-to-market accounting during the term of the various commodity hedging contracts, significant unrealized, non-cash net gains and losses could be recorded in our results of operations. Additionally, we may be required to collateralize any mark-to-market losses on outstanding commodity hedging contracts. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding crude oil and refined product hedging instruments that were entered into as economic hedges. Settlement prices for our distillate crack spread swaps range from   $13.72   to   $16.86   per contract. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels): 

14.    Stock-Based Compensation    
  Western Incentive Plans 
  The Western Refining 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2006 LTIP") and the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan of Western Refining (the "2010 Incentive Plan") allow for restricted share unit awards ("RSUs") among other forms of awards. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   19,856   and   2,391,711   shares of common stock reserved for future grants under the 2006 LTIP and the 2010 Incentive Plan, respectively. Awards granted under both plans vest over a scheduled vesting period of either   one  ,   three   or   five   years and their market value at the date of the grant is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Effective March 25, 2015, our board of directors approved administrative amendments to the 2010 Incentive Plan. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   658,506   unvested RSUs outstanding. We recorded stock compensation of   $1.8 million  ,   $4.5 million  ,   $1.1 million   and   $3.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate grant date fair value of outstanding RSUs was   $21.2 million  . The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding RSUs was   $17.4 million  . The unrecognized compensation cost of unvested RSUs was   $16.6 million  . Unrecognized compensation costs for RSUs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.63   years.

The tax deficiency related to the RSUs that vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $0.4 million   using a statutory blended rate of   38.1%  . There was   no   RSU vesting activity during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate grant date fair value of the RSUs that vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $4.1 million  . The related aggregate intrinsic value of these RSUs was   $3.0 million   at the vesting date. 
  The excess tax benefit related to the RSUs that vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , was   $0.03 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, using a statutory blended rate of   38.1%  .

The related aggregate intrinsic value of these RSUs was   $0.2 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, at the vesting date.  
  The following table summarizes our RSU activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Amended and Restated Northern Tier Energy LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
  Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Western adopted and assumed NTI's equity compensation plan and amended and renamed the plan as the Amended and Restated Northern Tier Energy LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("NTI LTIP"). Modifications to the NTI LTIP include, among other things, a change to the unit of equity from an NTI common unit to a share of Western common stock. The amendment changes the administrator of the NTI LTIP from the board of directors of NTI's general partner to Western's board of directors or its applicable committee. Consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement, all unvested equity awards at the time of the Merger were exchanged for Western phantom stock awards and performance cash awards under the NTI LTIP. 
  We incurred equity-based compensation expense of   $3.0 million  ,   $11.0 million  ,   $2.4 million   and   $7.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The NTI LTIP provides, among other awards, for grants of stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock, dividend equivalent rights, stock appreciation rights and other awards that derive their value from the market price of Western's common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   255,560   common share equivalents reserved for future grants under the NTI LTIP.  
  We determined the fair value of the phantom stock based on the closing price of Western common stock on the grant date. We amortize the estimated fair value of the phantom stock on a straight-line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards.  
  The aggregate grant date fair value of non-vested phantom stock outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $16.7 million  . The aggregate intrinsic value of such phantom stock was   $21.8 million  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested phantom stock totaled   $11.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.5 years  .

A summary of our phantom stock award activity under the NTI LTIP for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is set forth below: 

Western Refining Logistics, LP 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
  The Western Refining Logistics, LP 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "WNRL LTIP") provides, among other awards, for grants of phantom units and distribution equivalent rights. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   4,098,368   phantom units reserved for future grants under the WNRL LTIP. 
  The fair value of the phantom units is determined based on the closing price of WNRL common units on the grant date. The estimated fair value of the phantom units is amortized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards. WNRL incurred unit-based compensation expense of   $0.7 million  ,   $2.0 million  ,   $0.6 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The aggregate grant date fair value of non-vested phantom units outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $7.5 million  . The aggregate intrinsic value of such phantom units was   $6.6 million  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested phantom units totaled   $6.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.60   years.  
  A summary of WNRL's common and phantom unit award activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is set forth below: 

15.    Earnings per Share    
  We follow the provisions related to the accounting treatment of certain participating securities for the purpose of determining earnings per share. These provisions address share-based payment awards that have not vested and that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and state that they are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. 
  Diluted earnings per common share includes the effects of potentially dilutive shares that consist of unvested RSUs and phantom stock. These awards are non-participating securities due to the forfeitable nature of their associated dividend equivalent rights, prior to vesting and we do not consider the RSUs or phantom stock in the two-class method when calculating earnings per share.

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method is presented as follows: 

The computation of the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is presented below: 

A shareholder's interest in our common stock could become diluted as a result of vestings of RSUs and phantom stock. In calculating our fully diluted earnings per common share, we consider the impact of RSUs and phantom stock that have not vested. We include unvested awards in our diluted earnings calculation when the trading price of our common stock equals or exceeds the per share or per share unit grant price. 
   
  16.    Cash Flows    
  Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash reported in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  , related to net proceeds from the sale of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   to WNRL. This cash is restricted until the earlier of a) use of the cash to invest in capital assets to replace the collateral assets that were sold, b) acceptance by holders of the   NTI 2020 Secured Notes   of an offer to repurchase such notes at par or c) expiration of an offer to repurchase the   NTI 2020 Secured Notes  . NTI commenced a tender offer to repurchase for cash up to   $195.0 million   aggregate principal amount the   NTI 2020 Secured Notes   on October 17, 2016, and such offer expires on November 15, 2016. Any cash remaining after the offer to repurchase expires will become unrestricted and available for general corporate purposes.  
  Restricted cash reported in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015  , related to net proceeds from the sale of Western's TexNew Mex Pipeline System to WNRL. This cash was used to invest in capital assets.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
  Supplemental disclosures of cash flow information were as follows: 

17.    Leases and Other Commitments    
  We have commitments under various operating leases with initial terms greater than one year for retail convenience stores, office space, warehouses, cardlocks, railcars and other facilities, some of which have renewal options and rent escalation clauses. These leases have terms that will expire on various dates through   2040  . We expect that in the normal course of business, these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Certain of our lease agreements provide for the fair value purchase of the leased asset at the end of the lease. Rent expense for operating leases that provide for periodic rent escalations or rent holidays over the term of the lease and for renewal periods that are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
  In the normal course of business, we also have long-term commitments to purchase products and services, such as natural gas, electricity, water and transportation services for use by our refineries and logistic assets at market-based rates. We are also party to various refined product and crude oil supply and exchange agreements. 
  Under a sulfuric acid regeneration and sulfur gas processing agreement with Veolia North America, Inc. ( Veolia ), Veolia owns and operates two sulfuric acid regeneration units on property we lease to Veolia within our El Paso refinery. Our annual estimated cost for processing sulfuric acid and sulfur gas under this agreement is   $15.7 million   through March of 2028. 
  In November 2007, we entered into a   ten  -year lease agreement for office space in downtown El Paso, Texas. The building serves as our headquarters. In December 2007, we entered into an   eleven  -year lease agreement for an office building in Tempe, Arizona. The building centralized our operational and administrative offices in the Phoenix area. 
  We are party to   38   capital leases, with initial terms of   20   years, expiring in   2017   through   2036  . The current portion of our capital lease obligation of   $1.3 million   and   $1.0 million   is included in accrued liabilities and the non-current portion of   $54.5 million   and   $53.2 million   is included in lease financing obligations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The capital lease obligations include a deferred gain of   $0.3 million  . These capital leases were discounted using annual rates from   3.24%   to   10.51%  . Total remaining interest related to these leases was   $41.0 million   and   $44.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Average annual payments, including interest, for the next five years are   $5.5 million   with the remaining   $73.0 million   due through   2036  .

The following table presents our future minimum lease commitments under capital leases and non-cancelable operating leases that have lease terms of one year or more (in thousands) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Total rental expense was   $17.9 million  ,   $53.9 million  ,   $16.2 million   and   $47.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Contingent rentals and subleases were not significant in any period. 
   
  18.    Commitments and Contingencies    
  Environmental Matters 
  Similar to other petroleum refiners, our operations are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in the future as regulations and other conditions change. 
  Periodically, we receive communications from various federal, state and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective action for these asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had consolidated environmental accruals of   $18.0 million   and   $18.3 million  , respectively. 
  El Paso Refinery 
  Prior spills, releases and discharges of petroleum or hazardous substances have impacted the groundwater and soils in certain areas at and adjacent to our El Paso refinery. We are currently remediating, in conjunction with Chevron U.S.A., Inc. ("Chevron"), these areas in accordance with certain agreed administrative orders with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (the "TCEQ"). Pursuant to our purchase of the north side of the El Paso refinery from Chevron, Chevron retained responsibility to remediate its solid waste management units in accordance with its Resource Conservation Recovery Act ("RCRA") permit that Chevron has fulfilled. Chevron also retained control of and liability for certain groundwater remediation responsibilities that are ongoing. 
  In May 2000, we entered into an Agreed Order with the TCEQ for remediation of the south side of our El Paso refinery property. We purchased a non-cancelable Pollution and Legal Liability and Clean-Up Cost Cap Insurance policy that covers environmental clean-up costs related to contamination that occurred prior to December 31, 1999, including the costs of the Agreed Order activities. The insurance provider assumed responsibility for all environmental clean-up costs related to the Agreed Order up to   $20.0 million  , of which   $6.5 million   remained as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, a subsidiary of Chevron is obligated under a settlement agreement to pay   60%   of any Agreed Order environmental clean-up costs that exceed the   $20.0 million   policy coverage.

Four Corners Refineries 
  Four Corners 2005 Consent Agreements.   In July 2005, as part of the EPA Initiative, Giant Industries, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, reached an administrative settlement with the New Mexico Environment Department (the "NMED") and the EPA in the form of consent agreements that resolved certain alleged violations of air quality regulations at the Gallup and Bloomfield refineries in the Four Corners area of New Mexico. In January 2009 and June 2012, we and the NMED agreed to amendments of the 2005 administrative settlement (the "2005 NMED Amended Agreement") that altered certain deadlines and allowed for alternative air pollution controls. 
  We incurred   $50.8 million   in total capital expenditures between 2009 and 2013 to address the requirements of the 2005 NMED Amended Agreement. These capital expenditures were primarily for installation of emission controls on the heaters, boilers and Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit ("FCCU") and for reducing sulfur in fuel gas to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, NOx and particulate matter from our Gallup refinery. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the capital expenditures required by the 2005 NMED Amended Agreement to implement one or more FCCU emission offset projects prior to the end of 2017. We incurred   $0.1 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and   $0.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , to implement an FCC emission offset project. We paid penalties between 2009 and 2012 totaling   $2.7 million  . For 2017, we have budgeted capital projects specifically designed to address our compliance with the 2005 NMED Amended Agreement regarding air emissions from waste handling at our Gallup refinery. 
  Bloomfield 2007 NMED Remediation Order.   In July 2007, we received a final administrative compliance order from the NMED alleging that releases of contaminants and hazardous substances that have occurred at the Bloomfield refinery over the course of its operations prior to June 1, 2007, have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. Among other things, the order requires that we investigate the extent of such releases, perform interim remediation measures and implement corrective measures. Prior to July 2007, with the approval of the NMED and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, we placed into operation certain remediation measures that remain operational.  
  St. Paul Park Refinery 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , liabilities for remediation and closure obligations and related operations at the St. Paul Park refinery totaled   $7.6 million   and   $8.6 million  , respectively, of which   $2.4 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, are recorded on a discounted basis. These discounted liabilities are expected to be settled over at least the next   21   years. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated future cash flows to settle these discounted liabilities totaled   $2.9 million   and are discounted at a rate of   2.03%  . Receivables for recoverable costs from the state, under programs to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail marketing outlets, and others were   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  On June 3, 2014, the St. Paul Park refinery was issued a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Permit/State Disposal System Permit by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") relating to its upgraded wastewater treatment plant at its St. Paul Park refinery. This permit required the refinery to conduct additional testing of its remaining lagoon. The testing was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, following the review of the test results and additional discussions with MPCA, we plan to close the remaining lagoon. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we estimated the remediation and closure costs to be   $5.2 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively. In connection with NTI's December 2010 acquisition of the St. Paul Park refinery, among other assets, from the Marathon Petroleum Company LP ("Marathon"), we entered into an agreement with Marathon that required Marathon to share in the future remediation costs of this lagoon, should they be required. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a settlement and release agreement with Marathon and received   $3.5 million   pursuant to this settlement that we recorded as a reduction of direct operating expenses. 
  Legal Matters 
  On August 24, 2016, an alleged NTI unitholder ( Plaintiff ) filed a purported class action lawsuit against Western, NTI, NTI GP, members of the NTI GP board of directors at the time of the Merger, Evercore Group, L.L.C. ( Evercore ), and MergerCo (collectively,  Defendants ) (the  Merger Litigation ). The Merger Litigation appears to challenge the adequacy of disclosures made in connection with the Merger. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and attorneys  fees. The Merger Litigation is in the earliest stages of litigation. Western believes the Merger Litigation is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it. 
  Other Matters 
  The EPA has issued Renewable Fuels Standards ("RFS"), that require refiners to blend renewable fuels into the refined products produced at their refineries. Annually, the EPA is required to establish a volume of renewable fuels that refineries must blend into their refined petroleum fuels. To the extent we are unable to blend at the rate necessary to satisfy the EPA mandated volume, we purchase Renewable Identification Numbers ("RIN"). The purchase price for RINs is volatile and may vary  
  
    31 

     Table of Contents  
  WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

significantly from period to period. The net cost of meeting our estimated renewable volume obligations, including sales and purchases of RINs, was   $15.8 million  ,   $51.9 million  ,   $13.1 million   and   $25.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The supply and demand environment for RINs is uncertain and we cannot predict the impact of RIN purchases on our results of operations in any given period. 
  In addition, the EPA has investigated and brought enforcement actions against companies it believes produced invalid RINs. We have purchased RINs that the EPA determined were invalid. Previously, we have entered into settlements and entered into another settlement in May 2015, with the EPA regarding RINs we purchased that the EPA ultimately determined were invalid. While we do not know if the EPA will determine that other RINs we have purchased are invalid, at this time we do not expect any settlements we would enter into with the EPA would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  We are party to various other claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business. We believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  19.    Related Party Transactions    
  We lease office space in a building located in El Paso, Texas that is owned by an entity controlled by a member of our board of directors who is also an officer. The lease agreement expires in May 2017. Under the terms of the lease, we make annual payments of   $0.2 million  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made rental payments under this lease to the related party of   $0.06 million  ,   $0.18 million  ,   $0.06 million   and   $0.18 million  . We have   no   amounts due as of   September 30, 2016  , related to this lease agreement. 
  Beginning on September 30, 2014, we began paying MPL for transportation services at published tariff rates. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid   $12.3 million  ,   $41.1 million  ,   $13.9 million   and   $41.3 million  , respectively, in crude transportation costs with MPL. Western's President and Chief Operating Officer is a member of MPL's board of managers. 
   
  20.    Condensed Consolidating Financial Information    
  Separate condensed consolidating financial information of Western Refining, Inc. (the "Parent"), subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors is presented below. At   September 30, 2016  , the Parent and certain subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis. NTI and WNRL are subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes. As a result of the Parent and certain subsidiaries' guarantee arrangements, we are required to present the following condensed consolidating financial information that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  Due to the retrospective adjustments of financial position, results of operations and cash flows from the guarantor to the non-guarantor entities resulting from the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction, we have made corresponding retrospective adjustments to the condensed consolidating financial information for all periods presented. See   Note 1, Organization  , for additional information on this transaction. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   100%   limited partnership interest in NTI and a   52.6%   limited partnership interest in WNRL, and the non-financial general partner interests of both entities. We are the primary beneficiary of WNRL's earnings and cash flows. We exercise control of WNRL through our   100%   ownership of its general partner. Accordingly, NTI and WNRL are consolidated with the other accounts of Western.  
  NTI's long-term debt is comprised of the NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the NTI Revolving Credit Facility. NTI creditors under the NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the NTI Revolving Credit Facility have no recourse to the Parent's assets except to the extent of the assets of Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, the general partner of NTI that we wholly own. Any recourse to NTI s general partner would be limited to the extent of the general partner s assets that other than its investment in NTI are not significant. Furthermore, the Parent's creditors have no recourse to the assets of NTI's general partner, NTI and its consolidated subsidiaries. See   Note 9, Long-Term Debt  , for a description of NTI s debt obligations. 
  WNRL generates revenues by charging fees and tariffs for transporting crude oil through its pipelines; for transporting crude oil and asphalt through its truck fleet; for transporting refined and other products through its terminals and pipelines, for providing storage in its storage tanks and at its terminals and selling refined products through its wholesale distribution network. We do not provide financial or equity support through any liquidity arrangements and/or debt guarantees to WNRL. 
  WNRL's long-term debt is comprised of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes and the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility. With the exception of the assets of Western Refining Logistic GP, LLC, the general partner of WNRL, creditors have no recourse to our

assets. Any recourse to WNRL s general partner would be limited to the extent of Western Refining Logistic GP, LLC s assets which, other than its investment and incentive distribution rights in WNRL, are not significant. Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of WNRL and its consolidated subsidiaries. See   Note 9, Long-Term Debt  , for a description of WNRL s debt obligations. 
  The following condensed consolidating financial information is provided as an alternative to providing separate financial statements for guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements of Western s subsidiary guarantors are not included because the guarantees are full and unconditional and these subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned and jointly and severally liable for the Parent s outstanding debt. The information is presented using the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries.

21.    Acquisitions    
  Description of the Transaction 
  On December 21, 2015, Western entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among Western, MergerCo, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, the general partner of NTI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ( NTI GP ). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, MergerCo merged with and into NTI, the separate limited liability company existence of MergerCo ceased and NTI continued to exist as a limited partnership under Delaware law and as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western and as the surviving entity in the Merger. 
  Prior to the Merger, NT InterHoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ("NT InterHoldCo"), owned   100%   of the membership interests in NTI GP and   38.3%   of NTI s outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in NTI ( NTI Common Units ). NT InterHoldCo also owned   100%   of the membership interests in Western Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and holder of   100%   of the membership interests in MergerCo ( MergerCo HoldCo ). Following the Merger, NTI GP remained the sole general partner of NTI, the NTI Common Units held by Western and its subsidiaries were unchanged and remained issued and outstanding, and, by virtue of the Merger, all of the membership interests in MergerCo automatically converted into the number of NTI Common Units (excluding any NTI Common Units owned by Western and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

effective time of the Merger. Consequently, NT InterHoldCo and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MergerCo HoldCo, became the sole limited partners of NTI.  
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we paid   $859.9 million   in cash and issued   17.1 million   shares of Western common stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We incurred transaction costs related to the Merger of   $11.7 million  .  
  The Merger involved a change in WNR s ownership interest in its subsidiary, NTI, due to the purchase of the remaining ownership interests not already owned by WNR and was accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 810-10-45-23,   Consolidation  , which indicates that increases in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary shall be accounted for as an equity transaction. Therefore,   no   gain or loss was realized as a result of the Merger. Any difference between the consideration paid and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted was recognized in Western shareholders' equity.  
  NTI common unitholders made consideration elections that resulted in the following allocation of cash and Western common stock among NTI common unitholders.  
             
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Mixed Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or who made no election, received   $15.00   in cash and   0.2986   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Cash Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   $15.357   in cash and   0.28896   of a share of Western common stock as prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Stock Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   0.7036   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held.  
     The consolidated statements of operations include the results of the Merger beginning on June 23, 2016. The following unaudited pro forma information assumes that (i) the Merger occurred on January 1, 2015; (ii)   $500.0 million   was borrowed to fund the Merger consideration on January 1, 2015, resulting in increased interest and debt expense of   $17.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $9.1 million   and   $27.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively; and (iii) income tax expense increased as a result of the increased net income attributable to Western Refining, Inc. offset by increased interest and debt expense of   $7.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $19.1 million   and   $64.9 million  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Merger and Reorganization Expenses 
  We incurred professional service fees in connection with the Merger transaction. Additionally, we incurred costs associated with initiating a plan of reorganization for various positions during the third quarter of 2016. In relation to this reorganization plan, it was determined that certain employees would be terminated during 2016 and 2017. We recognized   $2.8 million   and   $4.0 million   of expense during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which included compensation related to the severance of employment and retention bonuses for selected employees. These costs have been included in Other, net in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All reorganization and

related costs are recognized in the Other category. We recognize these costs ratably from September 1, 2016, the effective date of the agreements, through the remaining service period, which varies for each employee, but in no case is later than September 1, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , we anticipate that these costs will continue to be recognized through the third quarter of 2017 and for the expenses to be completely paid out by December 31, 2017. 
  The following table summarizes the expense activity related to the Merger and Reorganization for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

22.    WNRL 
  WNRL is a publicly held master limited partnership that owns and operates logistic assets that consist of pipeline and gathering, terminalling, storage and transportation assets, providing related services to our refining segment, including   692   miles of pipelines and   12.4 million   barrels of active storage capacity. The majority of WNRL's logistics assets are integral to the operations of the El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park refineries. 
  WNRL also owns a wholesale business that operates primarily in the Southwest. WNRL's wholesale business includes the operations of several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of crude oil, asphalt, refined product and lubricant delivery trucks. WNRL distributes commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. WNRL purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from our refining segment and from third-party suppliers. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   52.6%   interest in WNRL and a   100%   general partner interest. As the general partner of WNRL, we have the sole ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact WNRL's financial performance, and therefore we consolidate WNRL. 
  We are WNRL s primary logistics customer and a significant wholesale customer through our retail business. WNRL generates revenues by charging tariffs and fees for transporting petroleum products and crude oil though its pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons, and storing and providing other services at its storage tanks and terminals. Additionally, WNRL sells various finished petroleum products to us and other third-party customers. Under our long-term agreements with WNRL (discussed below), we accounted for   32.2%  ,   31.8%  ,   31.9%   and   30.0%   of WNRL s total revenues for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We do not provide financial or equity support through any liquidity arrangements and/or debt guarantees to WNRL. 
  WNRL has outstanding debt under a senior secured revolving credit facility and its senior notes. Excluding assets held by WNRL, WNRL s creditors have no recourse to our assets. Any recourse to WNRL s general partner would be limited to the extent of Western Refining Logistics GP LLC s assets that other than its investment in WNRL, are not significant.     Our creditors have no recourse to the assets of WNRL and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  WNRL provides us with various pipeline transportation, terminal distribution and storage services under long-term, fee-based commercial agreements. These agreements contain minimum volume commitments. Each agreement has fees that are indexed for inflation and provides us with options to renew for two additional five-year terms. 
  In addition to commercial agreements, we are also party to an omnibus agreement with WNRL that among other things provides for reimbursement to us for various general and administrative services provided to WNRL. We are also party to an operational services agreement with WNRL, under which we are reimbursed for personnel services provided by Western in support of WNRL's operations of its pipelines, terminals and storage facilities.

WNRL has risk associated with its operations. If a major customer of WNRL were to terminate its contracts or fail to meet desired shipping or throughput levels for an extended period of time, revenue would be reduced and WNRL could suffer substantial losses to the extent that a new customer is not found. In the event that WNRL incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect WNRL s loss, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in WNRL at that point in time.

"Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("2015 Form 10-K") and elsewhere in this report. You should read "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in this report. In this Item 2, all references to "Western Refining," "the Company," "Western," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Western Refining, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries including Western Refining Logistics, LP ("WNRL"), unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. 
   
  Company Overview 
  We are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products incorporated in September 2005 under Delaware law with principal offices located in El Paso, Texas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol  WNR.  We own certain operating assets directly; the controlling general partner interest and 100% limited partner interest in Northern Tier Energy ("NTI") and the controlling general partner interest, incentive distribution rights and a   52.6%   limited partner interest in WNRL. WNRL common partnership units trade on the NYSE under the symbol "WNRL."  
  We produce refined products at our refineries in El Paso, Texas (  131,000   barrels per day, or bpd), near Gallup, New Mexico (  25,000   bpd) and St. Paul Park, Minnesota (  98,000   bpd). We sell refined products primarily in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West Texas, the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico through bulk distribution terminals and wholesale marketing networks. We also sell refined products through two retail networks with a total of   545   company-operated and franchised retail sites in the United States. 
  Our 100% ownership of the general partner gives us effective control of WNRL. WNRL provides logistical services to our refineries in the Southwest and Upper Great Plains regions and operates several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of crude oil, asphalt and refined product delivery trucks. WNRL distributes wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we own   100%   of the limited partner interest in Northern Tier Energy LP ("NTI") and   100%   of its general partner. We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2015 (the  Merger Agreement ), with Western Acquisition Co, LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, to acquire all of NTI s outstanding common units not already held by us (the  Merger ). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger Agreement by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. We incurred   $500 million     of additional secured indebtedness under our amended term loan credit agreement to partially fund the Merger consideration.   See   Note 9, Long-Term Debt   and   Note 21, Acquisitions  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
  On   September 15, 2016  , we sold certain assets consisting of terminals, transportation and storage assets and related land located on site at our St. Paul Park refinery and Cottage Grove tank farm to WNRL. These assets primarily receive, store and distribute crude oil, feedstock and refined products associated with the St. Paul Park refinery (the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  "). WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange for   $195 million   in cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. We refer to this transaction as the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  ."  
  On   September 7, 2016  , WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale of   7,500,000   of its common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. 
  On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by WNRL of     3,750,000     common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to     562,500     additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully exercised the option on June 1, 2016.    
  On October 30, 2015, we sold a   375   mile segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system to WNRL that extends from WNRL's crude oil station in Star Lake, New Mexico, in the Four Corners region to its T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the "  TexNew Mex Pipeline System  "). We also sold an   80,000   barrel crude oil storage tank located at WNRL's crude oil pumping station in Star Lake, New Mexico and certain other related assets. WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange for   $170 million   in cash,   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   units of a newly created class of limited partner interests in WNRL, referred to as the "TexNew Mex Units." We refer to this transaction as the "  TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction  ."

We have organized our operations into   three     segments, refining, WNRL and retail, based on manufacturing and marketing processes, the nature of our products and services and each segment's respective customer base. Prior to the Merger on June 23, 2016, we also reported NTI as a separate reportable segment. Following the completion of the Merger, NTI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western and, as a result, we have moved its assets and operations into our other reportable segments. Beginning on July 1, 2016, our management team, led by our chief operating decision maker, began monitoring our business and allocating resources based on these   three     reportable segments. The St. Paul Park refinery and related operations are now included in the refining segment and the SuperAmerica retail and bakery assets and operations are now included in the retail segment. We have retrospectively adjusted the historical segment financial data for the periods presented to reflect our revised segment presentation.   See   Note 3, Segment Information  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our business segments.  
             
    Refining  .   Our refining segment owns and operates three refineries that process crude oil and other feedstocks primarily into gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and asphalt. We market refined products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains. The refining segment also sells refined products in the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico.  
                
    WNRL  .   WNRL owns and operates terminal, storage, transportation and wholesale assets in the Southwest and terminal and transportation assets in the Upper Great Plains region. WNRL's Southwest wholesale assets consist of a fleet of crude oil, asphalt and refined product truck transports and wholesale petroleum product operations. WNRL's primary customer is our refining segment. WNRL purchases its wholesale product supply from the refining segment and third-party suppliers.    
                
    Retail  .   Our retail segment operates retail convenience stores and unmanned commercial fleet fueling ("cardlock") locations located in the Southwest ("Southwest Retail") and Upper Great Plains ("SuperAmerica") regions. The retail convenience stores sell gasoline, diesel fuel and convenience store merchandise.    
      
  Major Influences on Results of Operations 
  Summary of   Third   Quarter   2016    
                
    We averaged throughput of   84,546   bpd at the St. Paul Park refinery for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   6.7%     decrease   from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in average throughput over the prior year relates primarily to the turnaround of our No. 2 crude unit that commenced in September 2016.

Our operating income   decreased     $574.9 million   from   September 30, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  , as shown by segment in the following table: 

The WNRL financial and operational data presented includes the historical results of all assets acquired from Western in the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   and the   TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction  . These transactions were transfers of assets between entities under common control. The financial information for the affected reporting segments has been retrospectively adjusted to include or exclude the historical results of the transferred assets for periods prior to the effective date of the transactions. See   Note 3, Segment Information  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these retrospective adjustments. 
  Overview of Segments 
  Petroleum based commodity values have significant influence, either directly or indirectly, on the results of operations and cash flows for each of our operating segments. The following key factors affect petroleum based commodity values:  
             
    supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products; 
                
    changes in domestic and foreign economies; 
                
    weather conditions;  
                
    domestic and foreign political affairs; 
                
    crude oil and refined petroleum product production levels; 
                
    logistics constraints;  
                
    availability of imports; 
                
    marketing of competitive fuels; 
                
    price differentials between heavy and sour crude oils and light sweet crude oils;  
                
    government regulation; and 
                
    availability and cost of Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs") to meet our Renewable Fuel Standards ("RFS") obligations. 
     Refining  . Our overall refining results of operations are significantly impacted by the difference between refinery revenues and the related cost of products sold. We define this difference as refinery gross margin, which is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refinery performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of products that we are able to sell refined products. The following items have a significant impact on our overall refinery revenues, cost of products sold and other results of operations and cash flows: 
             
    fluctuations in petroleum based commodity values such as refined product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks; 
                
    product yield volumes that are less than total refinery throughput volume, resulting in yield loss and lower refinery gross margin; 
                
    the impact of our economic hedging activity; 
                
    adjustments to reflect the lower of cost or market value of crude oil, finished product and retail LIFO inventory values; 
                
    availability and cost of RINs to meet our RFS obligations; 
                
    fluctuations in our direct operating expenses; 
                
    planned maintenance turnarounds, generally significant in both downtime and cost, are expensed as incurred; 
     
    47 

     Table of Contents  

seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products; and 
                
    unplanned downtime of our refineries generally leads to increased maintenance costs and a temporary increase in working capital investment. 
     We engage in hedging activity primarily to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production and to protect the value of certain crude oil, refined product and blendstock inventories. We record the results of our hedging activity within cost of products sold which directly impacts our results of operations. 
  Excise and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenues or cost of products sold. In addition to the crude oil that we purchase to process at our refineries, we also purchase crude oil quantities that are transported to different locations and sold to third parties. We record these sales on a gross basis with the sales price recorded as revenues and the related costs within cost of products sold. Consolidated cost of products sold for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , includes   $8.6 million   of realized and unrealized net   losses   from our economic hedging activities. The non-cash unrealized net   losses   included in the consolidated total were   $54.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. During 2015 and 2016, the volatility in crude oil prices and refining margins contributed to the variability of our results of operations. 
  Safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our refineries  operations are critical components of our financial performance. Unplanned downtime of our refineries generally results in lost refinery gross margin, increased maintenance costs and a temporary increase in our working capital investment. We attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime, such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project, through our planning process that considers product availability, the margin environment and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance. We occasionally experience unplanned downtime due to circumstances outside of our control. Certain of these outages may lead to losses that qualify for reimbursement under our business interruption insurance and we record such reimbursements as revenues when received. 
  Under an exclusive supply agreement with a third party, we receive monthly distribution amounts from the supplier equal to one-half of the amount by which our refined product sales in the Mid-Atlantic exceeds the supplier's costs of acquiring, transporting and hedging the refined product related to such sales. To the extent our refined product sales do not exceed the refined product costs during any month, we pay one-half of that amount to the supplier. Our payments to the supplier are limited to an aggregate annual amount of   $2.0 million  .   This supply agreement is due to expire at the end of 2016.    
  WNRL.   WNRL's terminal throughput volumes depend primarily on the volume of refined and other products produced at Western s refineries that, in turn, is ultimately dependent on supply and demand for refined product, crude oil and other feedstocks and Western s response to changes in demand and supply. 
  Earnings and cash flows from WNRL's wholesale business are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricants sold and transportation revenues from crude oil and asphalt trucking and delivery. These margins are equal to the sales price, net of discounts, less total cost of sales and are measured on a cents per gallon ("cpg") basis. Factors that influence margins include local supply, demand and competition. 
  Retail  . Earnings and cash flows from our retail business are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel and by the sales and margins of merchandise sold at our retail stores. Margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes and are measured on a cpg basis. Fuel margins are impacted by competition and local and regional supply and demand. Margins for retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the merchandise, net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage and are measured as a percentage of merchandise sales. Merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location, branding and competition. Our retail sales reflect seasonal trends such that operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year primarily due to lower demand for retail fuel. Earnings and cash flows from our cardlock business are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel sold. These margins are equal to the sales price, net of discounts less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes and are measured on a cpg basis. Factors that influence margins include local supply, demand and competition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In order to apply these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the continuing development of the information utilized and subsequent events, some of which we may have little or no control over. Our critical accounting policies could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates and recent accounting pronouncements that potentially impact us are discussed in detail under   Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related reporting and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see     Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): 

Compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , our current quarter consolidated gross margin   decreased   by   32.0%  . This   decrease   was primarily due to lower refining margins and economic hedging   gains  . We discuss refining margins and economic hedging activities under our refining segment. 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   The   decrease   in direct operating expenses was primarily due to decreases of   $2.6 million   and   $2.5 million   in our refining and WNRL segments, respectively, partially offset by an increase of   $3.3 million   in our retail segment. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted from   an increase   of   $4.7 million   in our corporate overhead, partially offset by a decrease of   $1.4 million   and   $1.0 million   in our refining and retail segments, respectively. The increase in corporate overhead was primarily due to higher professional and legal expenses and information technology expenses in the current period. 
  Maintenance Turnaround Expense  . We incurred turnaround expenses associated with the fall 2016 turnaround of the No. 2 crude unit at our St. Paul Park refinery during the   third   quarter of   2016  .  
  Depreciation and Amortization.   The   increase   between periods was primarily due to additional depreciation associated with logistics assets capitalized through the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin logistics system. 
  Interest and Debt Expense  . The increase in interest expense from prior periods was attributable to the interest incurred in   2016   on borrowings under the   Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility   that we issued during the second quarter of 2016 and borrowings under the NTI and WNRL revolving credit facilities that were outstanding during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , without a corresponding balance in the prior year period.  
  Provision for Income Taxes  . The decrease in the provision for income taxes from prior periods was primarily due to the release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions in the current quarter.

Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization):  

Compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our consolidated gross margin   decreased   by   27.9%   for the current period. This   decrease   was primarily due to economic hedging activities and lower refining margins. We discuss refining margins and economic hedging activities under our refining segment. 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   The   increase   in direct operating expenses was primarily due to   increases   of   $11.4 million   and   $1.7 million   in our retail and refining segments, respectively. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   The   decrease   in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted from   decreases   of   $3.9 million   and   $0.7 million   in refining and WNRL segments, respectively, partially offset by increases of   $1.1 million   and   $0.4 million   in our corporate overhead and retail segments, respectively. The   increase   in corporate overhead was due to   higher   employee expenses in the current period. 
  Maintenance Turnaround Expense  . We incurred turnaround expenses associated with the fall 2016 turnaround of the No. 2 crude unit at our St. Paul Park refinery during the   first nine months   of   2016  .  
  Depreciation and Amortization.   The   increase   between periods was primarily due to additional depreciation associated with our logistics assets related to the TexNew Mex Pipeline System and the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin logistics system. 
  Interest and Debt Expense  . The   increase   in interest expense from prior periods was attributable to interest incurred in   2016   on borrowings under the   Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility   that we issued during the second quarter of 2016, the full   nine   month period of interest incurred in   2016   on the   $300.0 million   WNRL 2023 Senior Notes that WNRL issued during the first quarter of 2015 and borrowings under the NTI and WNRL revolving credit facilities that were outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , without a corresponding balance in the prior year period.  
  Provision for Income Taxes  . The decrease in the provision for income taxes from prior periods was primarily due to the release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions in the current period.

Results by Segment 
  The following tables set forth our historical financial data by segment for the periods presented. We have organized our operations into   three     segments, refining, WNRL and retail, based on manufacturing and marketing processes, the nature of our products and services and each segment's respective customer base. Prior to the Merger on June 23, 2016, we also reported NTI as a separate reportable segment. Following the completion of the Merger, NTI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western and, as a result, we have moved its assets and operations into our other reportable segments. Beginning on July 1, 2016, our management team, led by our chief operating decision maker, began monitoring our business and allocating resources based on these   three     reportable segments. The St. Paul Park refinery and related operations are now included in the refining segment and the SuperAmerica retail and bakery assets and operations are now included in the retail segment. We have retrospectively adjusted the historical segment financial data for the periods presented to reflect our revised segment presentation.  See   Note 3, Segment Information  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  
  We present below the performance measure of gross margin for each of our reportable segments. Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our segments' performance as a general indication of the amount above segment costs of products that each reportable segment is able to sell its products.

Adjusted EBITDA 
  Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest and debt expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, maintenance turnaround expense and certain other non-cash income and expense items. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes, the accounting effects of significant turnaround activities (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA) and certain non-cash charges that are items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.    
  Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:    
             
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for significant turnaround activities, capital expenditures or contractual commitments;    
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;    
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and    
                
    Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.    
     Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.

Gross Margin.   Refinery gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization):  

Refining gross margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.  
  Excluding the impact of hedging activities, refinery gross margin per throughput barrel decreased in a manner generally consistent with the decrease in industry benchmarks. The Gulf Coast benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread (the "GC 3:2:1") declined to   $13.29   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $21.43   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI that, in recent quarters, has experienced price volatility relative to Brent crude oil reflective of the decline in global and domestic crude oil prices. During the   third   quarter of   2016  , this differential decreased to an average of   $0.97   per barrel from an average of   $4.03   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our El Paso refinery margins have historically benefited from the WTI Midland/Cushing crude oil differential. However, this differential has been volatile, has narrowed over the past year, and at times has shifted to a premium rather than a discount. The differential averaged a WTI Midland discount of   $0.31   per barrel during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $0.71   per barrel during the   third   quarter   2015  . The Group 3 6:3:2:1 benchmark crack spread   decreased   from an average of   $15.77   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to an average of   $9.85   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Refinery gross margin was also affected by   third   quarter   2016   net realized and unrealized economic hedging   gains   of   $0.1 million   compared to   gains   of   $27.2 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . We enter into hedge contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risks or to fix sales margins on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production. Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to our economic hedging instruments are the result of differences between forward crack spreads and the fixed margins from our hedge contracts. We incur unrealized commodity hedging losses when forward spreads are in excess of our fixed contract margins. Hedging gains or losses are included within cost of product sold, directly impacting our refinery gross margin. 
  Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was   $15.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $14.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in the net cost was primarily the result of an industry increase in the unit cost of RINs. Total refinery throughput   increased   by   0.005 million   barrels quarter over quarter. Our refined product sales volume   decreased   to   28.9 million   barrels during the   third   quarter of   2016   from   32.0 million   barrels during the   third   quarter of   2015  . The impact to cost of products sold of non-cash lower of cost or market ("LCM") inventory recoveries for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $15.2 million   compared to a charge of   $36.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses   decreased   quarter over quarter primarily due to decrease maintenance expenses in our St. Paul Park Refinery (  $8.1 million  ), lower outside support services expenses (  $1.8 million  ), lower chemical and energy expenses (  $1.1 million  ) and lower employee expenses (  $1.1 million  ), partially offset by an increase in environmental expenses (  $5.4 million  ) and transportation expenses in our St. Paul Park Refinery (  $4.1 million  ). 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  . The   decrease   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in insurance expense (  $0.7 million  ), information technology expenses (  $0.4 million  ), employee expenses (  $0.1 million  ) and travel expenses (  $0.1 million  ). 
  Maintenance Turnaround Expense  . We incurred turnaround expenses associated with the fall 2016 turnaround of the No. 2 crude unit at our St. Paul Park refinery during the   third   quarter of   2016  .  
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization   increased   due to additional depreciation associated with recently capitalized assets.

Refining gross margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.  
  Excluding the impact of hedging activities, refinery gross margin per throughput barrel   decreased   in a manner generally consistent with the   decrease   in industry benchmarks. The GC 3:2:1   declined   to   $12.45   in the   first nine months   of   2016   from   $20.72   in the   first nine months   of   2015  . Our crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI that, in recent quarters, has experienced price volatility relative to Brent crude oil reflective of the decline in global and domestic crude oil prices. During

the   first nine months   of   2016  , this differential decreased to an average of   $0.44   per barrel from an average of   $4.37   per barrel for the   first nine months   of   2015  . Our El Paso refinery margins have historically benefited from the WTI Midland/Cushing crude oil differential. However, this differential has been volatile, has narrowed over the past year, and at times has shifted to a premium rather than a discount. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the WTI Midland/Cushing differential averaged a discount of   $0.12   per barrel, compared to an average discount of   $0.57   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . This differential continues to be volatile and fluctuates based on local crude oil production, crude oil outflows at Midland and Cushing and regional refining throughput volumes. The Group 3 6:3:2:1 benchmark crack spread   decreased   from an average of   $14.35   per barrel for the   first nine months   of   September 30, 2015  , to an average of   $8.22   per barrel for the   first nine months   of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Refinery gross margin was also affected by net realized and unrealized economic hedging   losses   of   $8.6 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to net realized and unrealized economic hedging   gains   of   $10.3 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . We enter into hedge contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risks or to fix sales margins on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production. Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to our economic hedging instruments are the result of differences between forward crack spreads and the fixed margins from our hedge contracts. We incur unrealized commodity hedging losses when forward spreads are in excess of our fixed contract margins. Hedging gains or losses are included within cost of product sold, directly impacting our refining gross margin. 
  Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was   $51.9 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $32.8 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . This   $19.1 million   increase in RINs cost primarily results from an industry increase in the unit cost of RINs. Total refinery throughput   increased   by   0.5 million   barrels. Our refined product sales volume   decreased   to   85.5 million   barrels during the   first nine months   of   2016   from   92.5 million   barrels during the   first nine months   of   2015  . Offsetting these negative impacts on our overall refining margin was the impact to cost of products sold of non-cash LCM inventory recoveries of   $101.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a recovery of   $16.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses   increased   primarily as a result of increases in transportation expenses in our St. Paul Park refinery (  $9.5 million  ), environmental expenses (  $4.1 million  ), railcar lease expense of   $2.7 million   due to new short-term leases in 2016 and property taxes (  $2.3 million  ). Offsetting these increases were decreases in energy, chemical and catalyst expense (  $6.3 million  ) due to lower natural gas prices, operating materials and supplies (  $4.3 million  ), outside support services (  $2.2 million  ), maintenance expenses in our St. Paul Park refinery (  $1.8 million  ), insurance expense (  $1.2 million  ) and expense allocations to WNRL (  $1.2 million  ).  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  . The   decrease   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to   $1.8 million   paid in 2015 to terminate a supply agreement without corresponding current period activity, lower insurance expense (  $1.6 million  ), information technology expenses (  $1.3 million  ) and outside support services (  $0.2 million  ). Offsetting these decreases were increased employee expenses (  $1.3 million  ). 
  Maintenance Turnaround Expense  . We incurred turnaround expenses associated with the fall 2016 turnaround of the No. 2 crude unit at our St. Paul Park refinery during the   first nine months   of   2016  .  
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization   increased   due to additional depreciation associated with recently capitalized logistics assets.

     Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): 

WNRL's gross margin   decreased   by   $5.4 million   primarily due to   decreased   fee based revenues of   $4.3 million  . Fee based revenue decreased due to lower mainline movement volumes compared to 2015 and reduced crude oil trucking revenue of   $4.2 million  , in addition, lubricant margins decreased   $1.2 million  . Wholesale fuel sales revenue decreased due to overall pricing declines. The average price per gallon sold in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.58  , compared to   $1.90   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Partially offsetting the margin decrease was new activity in 2016 that includes   $1.9 million   in fees generated by WNRL's   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and   $2.1 million   in asphalt trucking fees, in addition, wholesale fuel margins increased   $0.6 million  .  
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses   decreased   primarily due to lower maintenance (  $1.1 million  ), employee expenses (  $0.4 million  ), chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process (  $0.4 million  ), outside support services (  $0.4 million  ), insurance (  $0.3 million  ) and lower fuel expense for WNRL's transportation department (  $0.2 million  ). Offsetting these decreases were increased operating expenses for WNRL's   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   period over period (  $0.4 million  ). 
  WNRL's logistics maintenance costs are generally cyclical in nature. WNRL's terminal facilities are subject to recurring maintenance for normal wear and related maintenance costs are generally consistent from period to period. Routine service cycle for tank inspections and maintenance at WNRL's storage facilities is generally every 10 years. Pipelines are also subject to routine periodic inspections. When WNRL changes the service use of a storage tank, maintenance costs will generally be higher due to increased costs of tank cleaning and hazardous material disposal. The cost of WNRL's maintenance is dependent upon the level of repairs deemed necessary as a result of the inspection of the specified asset. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   primarily due to greater expense allocations (  $0.4 million  ) and professional and legal services related to acquisitions (  $0.3 million  ). 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization   increased   due to the ongoing expansion of WNRL's Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): 

WNRL's gross margin   increased   by   $3.8 million   primarily due to   increased   fee based revenue of   $8.7 million  . Fee based revenues increased due to higher mainline volume movements compared to 2015. New activity in 2016 includes   $1.9 million   in fees generated by WNRL's   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and   $5.8 million   in asphalt trucking fees. Partially offsetting the margin increase were decreased wholesale fuel margins of   $2.6 million  , reduced crude oil trucking revenue of   $7.5 million   and a   $3.0 million   decrease in lubricant margins. Wholesale fuel sales revenue decreased due to overall pricing declines. The average price per gallon sold in the   first nine months   of   2016  , was   $1.47   compared to   $1.90   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses were relatively flat, but included decreases due to maintenance (  $2.7 million  ), lower fuel expense for WNRL's transportation department (  $1.2 million  ) and chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process (  $1.1 million  ), partially offset by higher outside support services (  $1.7 million  ) due to in-line inspections for pipeline segments and various tank repairs, higher employee expenses (  $1.5 million  ) resulting from an increase in the number of drivers in WNRL's truck fleet, increased environmental expenses (  $0.5 million  ) and increased operating expenses for WNRL's   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   period over period (  $0.8 million  ). 
  WNRL's logistics maintenance costs are generally cyclical in nature. WNRL's terminal facilities are subject to recurring maintenance for normal wear and related maintenance costs are generally consistent from period to period. Routine service cycle for tank inspections and maintenance at WNRL's storage facilities is generally every 10 years. Pipelines are also subject to routine periodic inspections. When WNRL changes the service use of a storage tank, maintenance costs will generally be higher due to increased costs of tank cleaning and hazardous material disposal. The cost of WNRL's maintenance is dependent upon the level of repairs deemed necessary as a result of the inspection of the specified asset.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   primarily due to   decreased   professional and legal services (  $0.5 million  ) related to acquisitions and other taxes (  $0.3 million  ), partially offset by increased public company costs (  $0.2 million  ). 
  Gain on disposal of assets, net  . The increase in gain on disposal of assets, net was primarily due to the sale of assets related to WNRL's lubricant sales activities in California during the current period. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization   increased   due to assets capitalized in WNRL's TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition, the ongoing expansion of WNRL's Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

The following table reconciles retail fuel sales and cost of retail fuel sales to net sales and cost of products sold: 

(1) 
    Retail fuel margin per gallon is a measurement calculated by dividing the difference between retail fuel sales and cost of retail fuel sales for our retail segment by the number of gallons sold. Retail fuel margin per gallon is a measure frequently used in the convenience store industry to measure operating results related to retail fuel sales. 
              (2) 
    Merchandise margin is a measurement calculated by dividing the difference between merchandise sales and merchandise cost of products sold by merchandise sales. Merchandise margin is a measure frequently used in the convenience store industry to measure operating results related to merchandise sales. 
     Gross Margin.   Retail gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The   decrease   in retail gross margin was the result of lower same store Southwest Retail fuel gross margin of   $8.7 million  , partially offset by   increased   same store Southwest Retail merchandise gross margin of   $0.8 million  . The net effect in Southwest Retail of four retail outlets closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in the second and third quarters of 2016 was   an increase   in retail gross margin of   $1.0 million  . SuperAmerica gross margin decreased by   $3.3 million   due lower fuel margins at company-owned locations. 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increased   from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . There was   an increase   in Southwest Retail same store direct operating expenses of   $0.7 million   and the net effect of four outlets that closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in the second and third quarters of 2016 was a   $0.7 million     increase   in expenses. The increase was also due to higher SuperAmerica direct operating expenses of   $1.5 million   resulting from greater lease expenses. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   The   decrease   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower SuperAmerica employee and professional and legal expenses and   decreased   cardlock employee expenses of   $0.3 million  .

     Gross Margin.   Retail gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The   decrease   in gross margin was primarily due to lower same store Southwest Retail fuel gross margin of   $7.4 million   and   a decrease   in cardlock gross margin of   $2.7 million   due to lower sales volumes. The net effect in Southwest Retail of 31 new retail outlets added during January of 2015, one retail outlet added in the second quarter of 2015, four retail outlets closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in the second and third quarters of 2016 was   an increase   in retail gross margin of   $2.0 million  . Southwest Retail same store merchandise gross margin   increased   by   $2.0 million  . SuperAmerica gross margin increased by   $2.9 million   due higher fuel and merchandise margins due to the expansion of the company-owned locations by   5   stores and franchised locations by   13   stores. 
  Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).   Direct operating expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increased   from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to higher SuperAmerica employee expense of   $2.7 million   due to a Minnesota state mandated increase in the minimum wage in mid-2015. Additionally, SuperAmerica incurred higher store lease expense and maintenance expense of   $2.6 million   and   $1.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to both additional company-operated stores and lease renewals at higher monthly rates. The net effect of 31 Southwest Retail outlets added during January of 2015, one added in the second quarter of 2015, four retail outlets closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in the second and third quarters of 2016 was an additional   $1.4 million   in expenses. Additionally, there was   an increase   in same store Southwest Retail employee and maintenance expense of   $2.0 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, partially offset by a decrease in same store Southwest Retail insurance expense and credit card processing fees of   $0.4 million   and,   $0.3 million  , respectively.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   The   increase   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher SuperAmerica professional and legal and property tax expenses, partially offset by   decreased   cardlock employee expenses of   $0.7 million  .

NTI 
  General Instruction H(2)(a) of Form 10-Q allows for the omission of   Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   from the presentation of NTI's financial position and operating results, provided that NTI includes within this Form 10-Q its management's narrative analysis of the results of operations explaining the reasons for material changes in revenue and expenses for the year-to-date periods presented. Set forth below are the operating results of NTI, as presented in NTI's standalone financial statements in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These operating results do not reflect Western's accounting adjustments to consolidate NTI into Western's operating segments. The following results are intended to be considered separately from Western's consolidated segment presentation, which incorporates NTI's operations, as adjusted in consolidation, into Western's reportable segments.  
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  , Compared to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 

Revenue  . Revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $2,149.0 million   compared to   $2,645.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   18.8%  . Refining revenue   decreased     21.8%   and retail revenue   decreased     9.3%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Refining revenue   decreased   primarily due to lower refined product prices due to market conditions, partially offset by   increased   sales volumes of   0.4%   in the   2016   period. Retail revenue   decreased   primarily due to lower fuel prices due to market conditions, partially offset by an increase in fuel gallons sold of   1.5%  . Excise taxes included in revenue   increased   by   $26.9 million   for the   2016   period over the   2015   period. 
  Cost of sales  . Cost of sales totaled   $1,685.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,957.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   13.9%  . Refining cost of sales   decreased     15.6%   and retail cost of sales   decreased     11.6%   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to lower crude oil costs and a   $61.9 million   benefit from a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, partially offset by   an increase   of   0.4%   in refining sales volumes. The   decreased   retail cost of sales was primarily due to lower costs of fuel products. Lastly, excise taxes included in cost of sales   increased   by   $26.9 million   for the   2016   period over the   2015   period. 
  Direct operating expenses  . Direct operating expenses totaled   $238.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $220.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   an increase   of   7.9%  , due primarily to higher  
  
    76 

     Table of Contents  

spending on refinery maintenance projects due to the more temperate weather experienced in the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period. The higher direct operating expenses were also driven by higher retail personnel costs in the   2016   period. These increases in costs were partially offset by reduced utilization of third-party trucking firms in North Dakota due primarily to a shift in   2016   whereby we purchased more crude oil from barrels already on the pipeline or at storage facilities as opposed to at the wellhead.  
  Turnaround and related expenses  . Turnaround and related expenses totaled   $26.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The turnaround costs in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , include turnaround and related costs incurred for the fall 2016 turnaround of our No. 2 crude unit. Such costs in the corresponding   2015   period relate to planning costs for a third quarter 2015 turnaround on our sulfur recovery unit. 
  Depreciation and amortization  . Depreciation and amortization was   $35.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   7.4%  . This   increase   was due primarily to increased refining assets placed in service since   September 30, 2015  , the most significant of which were improvements to a firewater system, truck loading terminal and parking facilities along with retail stores acquired under capital leases. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses  . Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $66.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $62.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   increase   of   5.2%   relates primarily to higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from new grants and performance award adjustments. 
  Merger-related expenses  . Legal and advisory costs of   $2.6 million   were incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as a result of the Merger Agreement with Western Refining. No such costs were incurred during the   2015   period. 
  Income from equity method investments  .   Income from equity method investments   was   $15.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $12.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   increase   was driven by higher equity income due to reduced spending on maintenance projects on the pipeline in the   2016   period. 
  Other (gain) loss  .   Other (gain) loss   was a   $0.7 million   gain for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.4 million   loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , driven primarily by fluctuations in the exchange rate between our functional currency, the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. 
  Interest expense, net  . Interest expense, net was   $18.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $22.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   relates primarily to the   $4.9 million   higher capitalization of interest expense on several large refining capital projects. 
  Income tax provision  . The income tax provision for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $3.7 million   compared to   $7.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was due primarily to lower income within retail. 
  Net income  . Our net income was   $88.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $343.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   in net income is primarily attributable to a   $223.5 million     decrease   in gross margin, a   $17.5 million     increase   in direct operating expenses and a   $3.3 million     increase   selling, general and administrative expenses. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by   $3.3 million   higher income from our equity method investment and other cost savings.

Outlook 
  Our refining margins, excluding hedging activities, were   weaker   at the El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park refineries in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The GC 3:2:1   decreased   from an average of   $21.43   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to an average of   $13.29   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The GC 3:2:1 for   October     2016   averaged   $13.25   per barrel. 
  The St. Paul Park refinery benchmarks its refining margin against the Group 3 6:3:2:1 benchmark crack spread. The Group 3 6:3:2:1 refers to the approximate refining margin resulting from processing six barrels of WTI crude oil to produce three barrels of gasoline, two barrels of diesel fuel and one barrel of residual fuel. Prices are derived from PADD II Group 3 conventional gas and ultra-low diesel fuel prices and the price of Western Canadian Select ( WCS ) crude oil for residual fuel. This benchmark decreased from an average of   $15.77   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to an average of   $9.85   per barrel for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Group 3 6:3:2:1 averaged   $7.73   per barrel for   October     2016  . 
  Both Western and NTI base crude oil purchases on pricing tied to WTI. The WTI Midland/Cushing differential can have a significant impact on refining margins at El Paso. The WTI Midland/Cushing differential averaged a   discount   of   $0.31   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016  , which, compared to a discount of   $0.71   per barrel that we realized in El Paso during the   third   quarter of   2015  , negatively impacted our El Paso refining margins in the current quarter. The WTI Midland/Cushing differential has averaged a   discount   of   $0.52   per barrel thus far in the   fourth   quarter of   2016  .  
  The discounts to WTI for Bakken Shale crude oil and WCS crude oil can have a significant impact on refining margins at St. Paul Park. The Bakken/WTI discount averaged   $1.25   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $2.36   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The Bakken/WTI discount averaged   $0.72   per barrel for October 2016. The WCS/WTI discount averaged   $13.71   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016   versus   $14.47   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The WCS/WTI discount averaged   $14.17   per barrel for   October     2016  . 
  The prices of crude oil and refined products have been volatile thus far in 2016. Continued volatility in these prices may impact the carrying value of our inventories and result in additional lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. An increase in prices, such as we experienced in the first   nine   months of 2016, may positively impact the carrying value of our inventories, while a decrease in these prices could negatively impact our inventory carrying values. Also, during the   first nine months   of   2016  , we experienced volatility in the pricing of RINs. We expect continued volatility as the industry strives to meet RFS obligations. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and Western revolving credit facility availability. To a lesser extent, we also generate liquidity from the issuance of debt and equity securities and sales of assets to WNRL.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $266.1 million  , including NTI cash of   $14.6 million   and WNRL cash of   $16.5 million   and no direct borrowings under the Western revolving credit facility. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we had restricted cash of   $195.0 million  . Western had   $492.0 million   in total liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  , defined as Western s cash and cash equivalents plus net availability under Western's revolving credit facility. Western, NTI and WNRL had net availability under their revolving credit facilities of   $257.0 million  ,   $205.7 million   and   $479.0 million  , respectively.  
  WNRL purchased the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   for   $195.0 million   and   628,224   common units on   September 15, 2016  . WNRL funded the cash portion of the consideration through a combination of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility and   $174.7 million   of cash on hand primarily generated from WNRL's equity offering of   8,625,000   common units during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we paid   $859.9 million   in cash and issued   17.1 million   shares of Western common stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We incurred   $500 million   of additional secured indebtedness under the amended term loan credit agreement to partially fund the Merger consideration. See   Note 21, Acquisitions  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
  WNRL borrowed   $145.0 million   under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility on October 30, 2015, to partially fund the purchase of Western's TexNew Mex Pipeline System. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , WNRL repaid   $179.1 million   of its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility using the proceeds generated through our equity issuances during the period. 
  We had direct borrowings of   $52.0 million   and   $20.3 million   under the NTI and WNRL revolving credit facilities, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 9, Long-Term Debt  ,   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding our financing.

On   September 7, 2016  , WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale of   7,500,000   of its common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. 
  On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by WNRL of     3,750,000     common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to     562,500     additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully exercised the option on June 1, 2016.    
  Our board of directors has periodically approved various share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to   $200 million   of our outstanding common stock, per program. Our board of directors approved our current   $200 million   share repurchase program in September of 2015 (the "September 2015 Program") that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. We have repurchased   2.5 million   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $75.0 million   under the September 2015 Program. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $125.0 million   remaining in authorized expenditures under the September 2015 Program. 
  We will repurchase shares from time-to-time through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and subject to market conditions, as well as corporate, regulatory and other considerations. The share repurchase program may be modified or discontinued at any time by our board of directors.  
  Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

The   decrease   in net cash from operating activities period over period was primarily the result of the decrease in net income and the results of our commodity hedging activity, offset by changes in our working capital as disclosed in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Cash flows from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , combined with   $500.0 million   in additions to Western's long-term debt,   $393.9 million   of borrowings on the NTI and WNRL revolving credit facilities and   $277.8 million   from the issuance of WNRL common units, were primarily used for the following investing and financing activities: 
  Investing Activities: 
     Fund capital expenditures (  $235.1 million  ) including the use of   $69.1 million   of restricted cash; and 
     Increase in the amount of restricted cash (  $195.0 million  ). 
  Financing Activities: 
             
    Payment of consideration to NTI public unitholders (  $859.9 million  ), sourced from cash on hand and from the proceeds of additions to Western's long-term debt; 
        Repayment of NTI's revolving credit facility debt (  $287.5 million  );

  Future Capital Expenditures 
  We expect to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash from operations supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. The following table summarizes our   2016   forecasted spending allocation between sustaining, discretionary and regulatory projects for   2016  : 

The majority of Western's planned discretionary capital expenditures relate to crude oil logistics projects in the Permian Basin and discretionary growth projects at the St. Paul Park Refinery. WNRL s discretionary capital expenditures primarily relate to construction of a 10-inch pipeline connection from its pipeline system in the Four Corners region of Northern New Mexico to the   TexNew Mex Pipeline System   and continued expansion of its Permian Delaware Basin system.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
     Commodity price fluctuation is our primary source of market risk. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations. Our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices that depend on many factors, including demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products; changes in the economy; worldwide and domestic production levels; worldwide inventory levels; and governmental regulatory initiatives. Our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations or to fix sales margins on future gasoline and distillate production.  
  In order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility, we have generally applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level. In the past, circumstances have occurred, such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand, that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level. We may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances. 
  We maintain inventories of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks and refined products with values that are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic conditions, regional and global inventory levels and seasonal conditions. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we held   10.4 million   barrels of crude oil, refined product and other inventories valued under the LIFO valuation method with an average cost of   $63.96   per barrel. At   September 30, 2016  ,   the excess of the LIFO cost over the current cost of these crude oil, refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories was     $193.3 million  . 
  All commodity futures contracts, price swaps and options are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recorded under cost of products sold in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  We selectively utilize commodity hedging instruments to manage our price exposure to our LIFO inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes. The commodity hedging instruments may take the form of futures contracts, price and crack spread swaps or options and are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy. The financial instruments used to fix margins on future sales volumes do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these hedging instruments are included in income in the period of change. Net gains or losses associated with these transactions are reflected within cost of products sold at the end of each period. 
  The following tables summarize our economic hedging activity recognized within cost of products sold for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and open commodity hedging positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not have any commodity derivative instruments that were designated or accounted for as hedges.

  1  . DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Description of the Business 
  Northern Tier Energy LP ("NTE LP", "NTI" "Northern Tier" or the "Company") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Refining, Inc. ("Western") operating as a downstream energy company with refining, retail and logistics operations that serve the Petroleum Administration for Defense District II ( PADD II ) region of the United States. NTE LP holds   100%   of the membership interest in Northern Tier Energy LLC ( NTE LLC ). NTE LP is a master limited partnership ( MLP ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
  NTE LP includes the operations of NTE LLC, St. Paul Park Refining Co. LLC ( SPPR ), Northern Tier Retail Holdings LLC ( NTRH ) and Northern Tier Oil Transport LLC ( NTOT ). NTRH is the parent company of Northern Tier Retail LLC ( NTR ) and Northern Tier Bakery LLC ( NTB ). NTR is the parent company of SuperAmerica Franchising LLC ( SAF ). SPPR owns a   17%   interest in MPL Investments Inc. ( MPLI ) and a   17%   interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC ( MPL ). MPLI owns   100%   of the preferred interest in MPL, which owns and operates a   465,000   barrel per day ( bpd ) crude oil pipeline in Minnesota (see Note   6  ). NTOT is a crude oil trucking business in North Dakota that collects crude oil directly from wellheads in the Bakken shale and transports it to regional pipeline and rail facilities. 
  Western indirectly owns   100%   of both Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTE GP") and NTE LP. Western, through its subsidiary NT InterHold Co LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NT InterHold Co") as the owner of the general partner of NTE LP, has the ability to appoint all of the members of the NTE GP's board of directors. 
  On   December 21, 2015  , Western and NTE LP announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of   December 21, 2015   ("the Merger Agreement"), with NTE GP and Western Acquisition Co, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ("MergerCo") whereby Western would acquire all of Northern Tier's outstanding common units not already owned by Western (the "Merger").  
  Based upon the consideration elections made by NTI common unitholders, this cash and Western common stock was allocated among NTI common unitholders as follows:  
             
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Mixed Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or who made no election, received   $15.00   in cash and   0.2986   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Cash Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   $15.357   in cash and   0.28896   of a share of Western common stock as prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Stock Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   0.7036   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held.  
     On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. The transaction resulted in approximately   17.1 million   additional shares of WNR common stock outstanding. Subsequent to this transaction, NTI continues to exist as a limited partnership and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western (see Note   19  ). 
  Refining Business 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the St. Paul Park refinery owned by SPPR, which is located in St. Paul Park, Minnesota, had total crude oil throughput capacity of   98,000   barrels per stream day. Refining operations include crude fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming, alkylation, sulfur recovery and a hydrogen plant. The refinery processes predominately North Dakota and Canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, asphalt, propane, propylene and sulfur. The refined products are sold primarily in the Upper Great Plains of the United States. 
  On September 7, 2016, SPPR entered into a Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement (the  Contribution Agreement ) by and among Western, SPPR, Western Refining Logistics, LP ("WNRL") and Western Refining Logistics GP, LLC, the general partner of WNRL. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, SPPR sold certain tank, terminal, rack, transportation facilities and other logistics assets to WNRL in exchange for   $195 million   cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL.  Concurrent with the Contribution Agreement, SPPR and WNRL entered into a terminalling, transportation and storage services agreement with an initial term of   ten   years whereby SPPR will pay fees to WNRL for storage, product throughput and blending services.  See Note   3   for further discussion of this transaction.  
  
    91 

Retail Business 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , NTR operated   170   convenience stores under the SuperAmerica brand and SAF supported   115   franchised stores which also utilize the SuperAmerica brand. These   285   SuperAmerica stores are primarily located in Minnesota and Wisconsin and sell gasoline, merchandise and, in some locations, diesel fuel. There is a wide range of merchandise sold at the stores including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. The merchandise sold includes a significant number of proprietary items. NTB prepares and distributes food products under the SuperMom s brand primarily to SuperAmerica branded retail outlets. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods reported have been included. Operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,   2016  , or for any other period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015  , has been derived from the audited financial statements of NTE LP at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  2  . SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of accounting policies and are incorporated herein by reference. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  NTE LP is a Delaware limited partnership which consolidates all accounts of NTE LLC and its subsidiaries, including SPPR, NTRH and NTOT. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company s common equity interest in MPL and WNRL are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Although SPPR owns only   1.0%   of WNRL's common equity, its indirect parent company, Western, owns   52.6%  . Because of Western s controlling influence over WNRL, the investment provides the Company significant influence over WNRL and the Company accounts for its ownership interest in WNRL under the equity method. Equity income from MPL and WNRL represent the Company s proportionate share of net income available to common equity owners generated by MPL and WNRL. See Note   3     for further discussion of the Company's ownership interests in MPL and WNRL.  
  The equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts or circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in operating income. See Note   6   for further information on the Company s equity method investment. 
  MPLI owns all of the preferred membership units of MPL. This investment in MPLI, which provides the Company no significant influence over MPLI, is accounted for as a cost method investment. The investment in MPLI is carried at a value of   $6.8 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and is included in other noncurrent assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Operating Segments 
  The Company has   two   reportable operating segments; Refining and Retail (see Note   18   for further information on the Company s operating segments). The Refining and Retail operating segments consist of the following:    
             
    Refining   operates the St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery, terminal and related assets, NTOT and includes the Company s interest in MPL and MPLI, and 
                
    Retail   comprised of   170   Company operated convenience stores and   115   franchisee operated convenience stores as of   September 30, 2016  , primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The retail segment also includes the operation of NTB. 
     
    92 

Inventories 
  Crude oil, refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market ("LCM"). Cost is determined principally under the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues for refining inventories. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location. Ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net realizable market values and charged to cost of sales in the period recorded. In subsequent periods, a new LCM determination is made based upon current circumstances relative to, and not to exceed, the original LCM reserve that was established in fourth quarter 2014. The Company has LIFO pools for crude oil and other feedstocks and for refined products in its Refining segment and a LIFO pool for refined products inventory held by the retail stores in its Retail segment. Retail merchandise inventory is valued using the average cost method. 
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Such assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. 
  When property, plant and equipment depreciated on an individual basis is sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of sale. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are generally recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale. 
  Expenditures for routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred. Refinery process units require periodic major maintenance and repairs that are commonly referred to as  turnarounds.  Turnaround cycles vary from unit to unit but can be as short as   one   year for catalyst changes to as long as   six   years. Turnaround costs are expensed as incurred. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company is exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility due to fluctuations in crude oil, refined products, and natural gas prices. The timing of certain commodity purchases and sales also subject the Company to earnings and cash flow volatility. To manage these risks, the Company may use derivative instruments associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas to hedge volatility in our refining and operating margins. The Company may use futures, options, and swaps contracts to manage price risks associated with inventory quantities above or below target levels. Crack spread and crude differential futures and swaps contracts may also be used to hedge the volatility of refining margins. 
  All derivative instruments, except for those that meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception, are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are classified depending on the maturity date of the underlying contracts. Changes in the fair value of the Company's contracts are accounted for by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Gains and losses from derivative activity specific to managing price risk on inventory quantities both above and below target levels are included within cost of sales. Derivative gains and losses are reported as operating activities within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  The Company enters into crude oil forward contracts to facilitate the supply of crude oil to the refinery. These contracts may qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception because the Company physically receives and delivers the crude oil under the contracts and when the Company enters into these contracts, the quantities are expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business. These transactions are reflected in the period that delivery of the crude oil takes place. When forward contracts do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, the contracts are marked to market each period through the settlement date, which is generally no longer than one to three months. 
  Renewable Identification Numbers 
  The Company is subject to obligations to generate or purchase Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs") required to comply with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The Company's overall RINs obligation is based on a percentage of domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). To the degree the Company is unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy its RINs obligation, RINs must be purchased on the open market to avoid penalties and fines. The Company records its RINs obligation on a net basis in accrued liabilities when its RINs liability is greater than the amount of RINs earned and purchased in a given period and in other current assets when the amount of RINs earned and purchased is greater than the RINs liability. 
  In 2010 and 2011, the EPA issued partial waivers with conditions allowing a maximum of   15%   ethanol to be used in certain vehicles. Future changes to existing laws and regulations could increase the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels. Because the Company does not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of  
  
    93 

renewable fuels that must be blended into its products could displace an increasing volume of the Company's refineries' product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and materially adversely affecting our ability to issue dividends to the Company's unitholders. The purchase price for RINs is volatile and may vary significantly from period to period. Historically, the cost of purchased RINs has not had a significant impact upon the Company's operating results. The Company anticipates   2016   will be consistent with this history. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to customers, title is transferred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are recorded net of discounts granted to customers. Shipping and other transportation costs billed to customers are presented on a gross basis in revenues and cost of sales. 
  Nonmonetary product exchanges and certain buy/sell crude oil transactions, which are entered into in contemplation one with another, are included on a net cost basis in cost of sales. The Company also enters into agreements to purchase and sell crude oil to third parties and certain of these activities are recorded on a gross basis.  
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income excludes depreciation and amortization of refinery assets and the direct labor and overhead costs related to the operation of the refinery. These costs are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in the depreciation and amortization and direct operating expenses line items, respectively. 
  Excise Taxes 
  The Company is required by various governmental authorities, including federal and state, to collect and remit taxes on certain products. Such taxes are presented on a gross basis in revenue and cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. These taxes totaled   $104.6 million   and   $93.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $323.5 million   and   $296.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Accounting Developments 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. This guidance will now be effective for the Company's financial statements in the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on NTE's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases,  which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 840. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04 "Liabilities   Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products," which aligns recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products (for example, prepaid gift cards), with Topic 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, for non-financial liabilities. In general, certain of these liabilities may be extinguished proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06 "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments" which will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments. ASU 2016-06 clarifies that the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the  clearly and closely  criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  
    94 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)," which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 "Compensation   Stock Compensation," which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments," which provides guidance on presentation in the statement of cash flows on eight subject areas where there current GAAP either is unclear or does not include specific guidance, resulting in diversity in practice.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
   
  3  . RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Western indirectly owns   100%   of both Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTE GP") and NTE LP. On   December 21, 2015  , Western and NTE LP announced that they had entered into the Merger Agreement with MergerCo and NTE GP whereby Western will acquire all of NTE LP's outstanding common units not already owned by Western (see Note   19  ). The transaction closed on   June 23, 2016   (see Note   19  ).  
  On September 15, 2016, Western executed the Contribution Agreement by and among Western, SPPR, WNRL and Western Refining Logistics GP, LLC, the general partner of WNRL. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, SPPR has agreed to sell to WNRL approximately   four million   barrels of refined product and crude oil storage tanks, a light products terminal, a heavy products loading rack, certain rail and barge facilities, certain other related logistics assets, and two crude oil pipeline segments and one pipeline segment not currently in service, each of which is approximately   2.5   miles and extends from SPPR s refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota to SPPR s tank farm in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, in exchange for   $195 million   in cash and   628,224   of common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The Company's book value on the date of sale of the property, plant and equipment, certain assets under construction and additive inventory used in the terminal operations amounted to   $48.9 million  . The proceeds from this transaction, reduced by the book value of the assets sold was   $146.1 million  . The Company treated the transaction as a transfer of assets between entities under common control and, as such, accounted for the transfer at the historical book value of the assets as required by GAAP. We recognized the difference between the proceeds and the book value of the assets as an increase in equity.   
  In connection with the closing of the Contribution Agreement, SPPR entered into a terminalling, transportation and storage services agreement (the  Terminalling Agreement ) with Western Refining Terminals, LLC ( WRT ), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of WNRL. Pursuant to the Terminalling Agreement, WRT has agreed to provide product storage services, product throughput services and product additive and blending services at the terminal facilities located at or near SPPR s refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota. In exchange for such services, SPPR has agreed to certain minimum volume commitments and to pay certain fees. The Terminalling Agreement will have an initial term of   ten   years, which may be extended for up to   two   renewal terms of   five   years each upon the mutual agreement of the parties. 
  The Company has engaged in several types of transactions with Western and its subsidiaries including crude and feedstock purchases, asphalt purchases, finished product purchases, railcar leases and tank and terminal service fees. Additionally, the Company is party to a shared services agreement with Western and WNRL whereby the Company both receives and provides administrative support services. The shared services agreement was entered into with Western as of September 1, 2014, and was approved by the Conflicts Committee of the board of directors of NTE GP. On May 4, 2015, WNRL joined as a party to this agreement. The services covered by the shared services agreement include assistance with treasury, risk management and commercial operations, environmental compliance, information technology support, internal audit and legal.  
  MPL is also a related party of the Company. Prior to September 30, 2014, the Company had a crude oil supply and logistics agreement with a third party and therefore had no direct supply transactions with MPL prior to that date. Beginning on September 30, 2014, the Company began paying MPL for transportation services at published tariff rates. Additionally, the Company owns a   17%   interest in MPL (see Note   6  ) and generally receives quarterly cash distributions related to this investment.  
  
    95 

In addition to the Contribution Agreement, the Company engaged in the following related party transactions with unconsolidated affiliates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Company had the following outstanding receivables and payables with non-consolidated related parties at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

4  . INCOME TAXES 
  NTE LP is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. However, NTRH, the parent company of NTR and NTB, is taxed as a corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. No provision for income tax is calculated on the earnings of the Company or its subsidiaries, other than NTRH, as these entities are pass-through entities for tax purposes. 
  The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   37.9%   and   3.4%  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate was   4.0%   and   2.1%  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's consolidated federal and state expected statutory tax rates were   40.4%   and   40.9%  , respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the fact that only the retail operations of the Company are taxable entities. 
   
  5  . INVENTORIES 

Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method comprised   88%   and   89%   of the total inventory value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, prior to the application of the lower of cost or market reserve. 
  
    96 

In order to state the Company's inventories at market values that were lower than its LIFO costs, the Company reduced the carrying values of its inventory through LCM reserves of   $72.6 million   and   $134.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  6  . EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
  The Company has a   17%   common equity interest in MPL.  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company received a   1.0%   common equity interest in WNRL in connection with the Contribution Agreement (see Note   3  ), which was recorded at its historical cost given the transaction was treated as a transfer of assets under common control. The carrying value of these equity method investments was   $82.8 million   and   $82.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the equity method investment in MPL was   $5.8 million   and   $5.9 million   higher, respectively, than the underlying net assets of the investee, respectively. The Company is amortizing this difference over the remaining life of MPL s primary asset (the fixed asset life of the pipeline). 
  The Company recorded   $10.2 million   and   $4.2 million   in distributions from its equity method investments in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $14.5 million   and   $10.0 million  , respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   At September 30, 2015,   $4.2 million   of these distributions were declared but unpaid.  Equity income from the Company's equity method investments was   $5.3 million   and   $4.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $15.3 million   and   $12.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   
  7  . PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
  Major classes of property, plant and equipment ( PP E ) consisted of the following:    

PP E includes gross assets acquired under capital leases of   $10.8 million   and   $13.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with related accumulated depreciation of   $2.1 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively. The Company had depreciation expense related to capitalized software of   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2.8 million   for both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company capitalized interest expense related to capital projects within the refining segment of    $2.0 million   and   zero   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.9 million   and   zero   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  8  . INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Intangible assets are comprised of franchise rights and trade names amounting to   $33.8 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the franchise rights and trade name intangible asset values were   $12.4 million   and   $21.4 million  , respectively. These assets have an indefinite life and are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the intangible asset has been reduced below carrying value. Based on the testing performed as of June 30, 2016, the Company noted no indications of impairment.  
  
    97 

9  . DERIVATIVES 
  The Company is exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), and natural gas used in its operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on its results of operations and cash flows, the Company uses commodity derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options. The Company uses the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting in these instruments. The Company uses swaps primarily to manage its price and margin exposure. The positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with the Company's stated commercial risk management policy. The Company considers these transactions economic hedges of market risk but has elected not to designate these instruments as hedges for financial reporting purposes. 
  The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, except for those that qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception, as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and any related net gain or loss is recorded as a gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Observable quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 2 as described in Note   12  ) are considered to determine the fair values for the purpose of marking to market the derivative instruments at each period end. 
  Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk 
  The Company periodically uses futures and swaps contracts to manage price risks associated with inventory quantities both above and below target levels. The Company also periodically uses crack spread and crude differential futures and swaps contracts to manage refining margins. Under the Company's risk mitigation strategy, it may buy or sell an amount equal to a fixed price times a certain number of barrels, and to buy or sell in return an amount equal to a specified variable price times the same amount of barrels. Physical volumes are not exchanged and these contracts are net settled with cash. 
  The objective of the Company's economic hedges pertaining to crude oil and refined products is to hedge price volatility in certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase crude oil inventories. The level of activity for the Company's economic hedges is based on the level of operating inventories, and generally represents the amount by which inventories differ from established target inventory levels. The objective of the Company's economic hedges pertaining to natural gas is to lock in the price for a portion of the Company's forecasted natural gas requirements at existing market prices that are deemed favorable. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had open commodity derivative instruments as follows:    

  The information below presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity at   September 30, 2016  : 

98 

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
  The following tables provide information about the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the line items in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See Note   12   for additional information related to the fair values of derivative instruments.  
  The Company is required to post margin collateral with a counterparty in support of our hedging activities. Funds posted as collateral were   $7.5 million   and   $6.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The margin collateral posted is required by counterparties and cannot be offset against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default. The Company nets fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and obligations. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis. 

Effect of Hedging Instruments on Income 
  All derivative contracts are marked to market at period end and the resulting gains and losses are recognized in earnings. The following tables provide information about the gain or loss recognized in income on the Company's derivative instruments and the line items in the financial statements in which such gains and losses are reflected. 
  
    99 

Recognized gains and losses on derivatives were as follows: 

Market and Counterparty Risk 
  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its risk mitigating arrangements. The counterparties are large financial institutions with long-term credit ratings of at least   BBB+   by Standard and Poor s and   A3   by Moody s. In the event of default, the Company may be subject to losses on a derivative instrument s mark-to-market gains. The Company does not expect nonperformance of the counterparties involved in its risk mitigation arrangements.  
   
  10  . DEBT 
  ABL Facility 
  On September 29, 2014, NTE LLC and its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated asset-based ABL Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders and as collateral agent for the other secured parties (the "ABL Facility"). The borrowers under the ABL Facility are SPPR, NTB, NTR and SAF, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of NTE LLC. 
  Lenders under the ABL Facility hold commitments totaling   $500 million  , which is subject to a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Facility may be increased up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $750.0 million  , subject to certain conditions (including the agreement of financial institutions, in their sole discretion, to provide such additional commitments). The ABL Facility matures on September 29, 2019. The Company incurred financing costs associated with the new ABL Facility of   $3.0 million   which will be amortized to   Interest expense, net   through the date of maturity. 
  The ABL Facility is guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by NTE LLC and its subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by any newly acquired or formed subsidiaries, subject to certain limited exceptions. The ABL Facility and such guarantees are secured on a first priority basis by substantially all of NTE LLC's and such subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory and on a second priority basis by NTE LLC's and such subsidiaries  fixed assets (other than real property). 
  Borrowings under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between   0.50%   and   1.00%  ) or (b) a   LIBOR   rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between   1.50%   and   2.00%  ), in each case subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings, NTI is also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from   0.250%   to   0.375%   subject to adjustment based upon the average utilization ratio and letter of credit fees ranging from   1.50%   to   2.00%   subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. The ABL Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on debt, investments and dividends and the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing base under the ABL Facility was   $305.3 million   and availability under the ABL Facility was   $205.7 million  .  This availability is net of   $52.0 million   in direct borrowings and   $47.6 million   in outstanding letters of credit. The borrowers under the ABL Facility had   $52.0 million   in borrowings under the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016  , located in Long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
  2020 Secured Notes 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $350.0 million   of outstanding aggregate principal of our   7.125%   senior secured notes due 2020 (the  2020 Secured Notes ). A portion of these notes were issued with an offering premium of   $4.2 million  , which is being amortized to   Interest expense, net   over the remaining term of the notes. Additionally, professional service costs were incurred in both the issuance of the 2020 Secured Notes and the establishment of the ABL Facility which are presented within   Long-term debt   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of these costs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was   $9.5 million   and   $11.6 million  , respectively.  
  
    100 

The 2020 Secured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by all of the Company s existing and future   100%   direct and indirect subsidiaries on a full and unconditional basis; however, there are certain obligations not guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis as a result of subsidiaries being released as guarantors. A subsidiary guarantee can be released under customary circumstances, including (a) the sale of the subsidiary, (b) the subsidiary being declared  unrestricted,  (c) the legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, or (d) liquidation or dissolution of the subsidiary. Separate condensed consolidated financial information is not included as the guarantor company, NTE LP, does not have independent assets or operations. The 2020 Secured Notes and the subsidiary note guarantees are secured on a pari passu basis with certain hedging agreements by a first-priority security interest in substantially all present and hereinafter acquired tangible and intangible assets of NTE LLC and each of the subsidiary guarantors and by a second-priority security interest in the inventory, accounts receivable, investment property, general intangibles, deposit accounts and cash and cash equivalents collateralized by a   $500 million   secured asset-based ABL Facility with a maturity date of   September 29, 2019  . Additionally, the 2020 Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by NTE LP. NTE LP's creditors have no recourse to the assets of Western and its subsidiaries. Western's creditors have no recourse to the assets of NTE LP and its subsidiaries. The Company is required to make interest payments on May 15 and November 15 of each year, which commenced on May 15, 2013. There are no scheduled principal payments required prior to the 2020 Secured Notes maturing on November 15, 2020. The outstanding   $350.0 million   in 2020 Secured Notes are registered with SEC through two separate registrations occurring in October 2013 and January 2015.  
  At any time prior to the maturity date of the notes, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or any portion of the notes for the outstanding principal amount plus unpaid interest and a make-whole premium as defined in the indenture. If the Company experiences a change in control or makes certain asset dispositions, as defined under the indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all or part of the notes plus unpaid interest and, in certain cases, pay a redemption premium. 
  The 2020 Secured Notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability, subject to certain exceptions, of the Company to incur additional debt or issue preferred equity interests, to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire its equity interests, to make certain investments, loans and advances, to sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets, to merge, consolidate, lease or sell substantially all of the Company s assets, to suffer a change of control or to enter into new lines of business. 
   
  11  . EQUITY 
  Western indirectly owns   100%   of Northern Tier Energy GP LLC and   100.0%   of the limited partnership interest in NTE LP.  
  Merger with Western 
  On   December 21, 2015  , Western and NTE LP announced that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of   December 21, 2015   ("the Merger Agreement"), with NTE GP and Western Acquisition Co, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ("MergerCo") whereby Western would acquire all of Northern Tier's outstanding common units not already owned by Western (the "Merger").  
  Based upon the consideration elections made by NTI common unitholders, this cash and Western common stock was allocated among NTI common unitholders as follows:  
             
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Mixed Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or who made no election, received   $15.00   in cash and   0.2986   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Cash Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   $15.357   in cash and   0.28896   of a share of Western common stock as prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held. 
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Stock Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   0.7036   of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held.  
     On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. The transaction resulted in approximately   17.1 million   additional shares of WNR common stock outstanding. Subsequent to this transaction, NTI continues to exist as a limited partnership and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western (see Note   19  ). 
  Distribution Policy 
  Prior to our merger with Western, the Company generally made distributions, if any, within   60   days after the end of each quarter, to unitholders of record as of the applicable record date. The board of directors of the Company's general partner adopted a policy pursuant to which distributions for each quarter, if any, would equal the amount of available cash the Company generated in such quarter, if any. Distributions on the Company's units were in cash. Available cash for each quarter, if any, was determined by the board of directors of the Company's general partner following the end of such quarter. Distributions were  
  
    101 

expected to be based on the amount of available cash generated in such quarter. Available cash for each quarter was generally equal to the Company's cash flow from operations for the quarter, excluding working capital changes, less cash required for maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures, reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Company's general partner and its affiliates, debt service and other contractual obligations and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our general partner deemed necessary or appropriate, including reserves for turnaround and related expenses, working capital, and organic growth projects. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company declared and paid a prorated quarterly distribution for the period April 1, 2016, to June 13, 2016, which was paid on June 23, 2016, to unitholders of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement). 
  Subsequent to the merger with Western, Northern Tier changed its distribution policy to distribute cash to entities controlled directly or indirectly by Western on a discretionary basis with respect to timing and amount, subject to the restricted payments tests in the 2020 Secured Notes and ABL Facility, maintaining cash reserves sufficient to cover expected working capital needs, turnaround and capital spending needs, debt service, hedging net losses, and certain other contractual obligations deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of our general partner.   
  The following table details the quarterly distributions paid to common unitholders for each of the quarters in the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Changes in Partners' Equity 

From the beginning of the year to immediately prior to our merger with Western on   June 23, 2016  , the Company's common units issued and outstanding increased by   114,047  , which was primarily attributable to the conversion of phantom units into common units upon vesting (see Note   14  ). Upon our merger with Western,   100%   of our limited common units were indirectly owned by Western.  
   
  12  . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  As defined in GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP describes three approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions  
  
    102 

involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. 
  Accounting guidance does not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:    
             
    Level 1   Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
                
    Level 2   Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value. 
     The Company uses a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to use the best information available. Accordingly, valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The Company s current asset and liability accounts contain certain financial instruments, the most significant of which are trade accounts receivables and trade payables. The Company believes the carrying values of its current assets and liabilities approximate fair value. The Company s fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term duration of the instruments, the Company s historical incurrence of insignificant bad debt expense and the Company s expectation of future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. 
  The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

103 

As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   Level 3 fair value assets or liabilities.  
  The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the actual date of the event or of the change in circumstances that caused the transfer. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. 
  Assets not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and cost method investments, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   impairments of such assets. 
  The carrying value of debt, which is reported on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, reflects the cash proceeds received upon issuance, net of subsequent repayments. The fair value of the 2020 Secured Notes disclosed below was determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1).  

13  . ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
  The following table summarizes the changes in asset retirement obligations:    

14  . EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Prior to Northern Tier's merger with Western, the Company maintained the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"). Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Western's board of directors adopted and assumed the LTIP and amended and renamed the LTIP to the Northern Tier Energy LP Amended and Restated 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Amended LTIP"). The Amended LTIP changed, among other things, the unit of equity from a unit of NTI common partnership interest to a share of Western common stock and the administrator of the plan was changed from the board of directors of the NTE GP to the board of directors of Western or its applicable committee. All unvested equity awards at the time of the Merger with Western were exchanged for new awards under the Amended LTIP consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement.   
  
    104 

The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of   $3.0 million   and   $2.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively and   $11.0 million   and   $7.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, related to these plans. This expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  
  AMENDED LTIP 
  Approximately   0.2 million   Western common share equivalents are reserved for issuance under the Amended LTIP as of   September 30, 2016  . The Amended LTIP permits the award of stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock, dividend equivalent rights, stock appreciation rights and other awards that derive their value from the market price of Western's common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   0.8 million   shares of equity denominated awards and approximately   $9.0 million   in cash denominated awards were outstanding under the Amended LTIP. The Company recognized the expense on all LTIP awards ratably from the grant date until all units vested. Service-based awards generally vested ratably over a   three  -year period beginning on the award's first anniversary date and performance-based awards generally vested following the end of the measurement period which, for the performance-based phantom awards, had traditionally been   three   years after the commencement of the measurement period. Compensation expense related to service-based phantom awards was based on the grant date fair value as determined by the closing market price on the grant date, reduced by the fair value of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense related to performance-based phantom awards was based on the grant date fair value as determined by either the closing price on the grant date and management's estimates on the number of units that ultimately vested in the case of awards with company performance based criteria or by third-party valuation experts in the case of awards with market based criteria. For awards to employees, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate which was subject to revision depending on the actual forfeiture experience.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total unrecognized compensation cost for stock and cash awards under the Amended LTIP was   $11.4 million  .  
  Restricted Common Units 
  Legacy NTI Service-based Restricted Common Unit Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   restricted common units outstanding as all restricted common units were exchanged upon the Merger with Western. As a replacement for these awards, for every   one   unvested outstanding restricted common unit,   1.0323   shares of Western phantom stock were issued to the participant with all vesting dates remaining unchanged.  
  A summary of the service-based restricted common unit activity is set forth below:    

Phantom Common Units 
  Legacy NTI Service-based Phantom Common Unit Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   service-based phantom common units outstanding as all service-based phantom common units were exchanged in accordance with the Merger. For every   one   unvested service-based phantom common units outstanding,   1.0323   shares of Western phantom stock were issued to the participant with all vesting dates remaining unchanged.   
  
    105 

A summary of the service-based phantom common unit activity is set forth below:   

  Western Service-based Phantom Stock Awards 
  As a result of the Merger, both the previously outstanding service-based restricted and phantom common unit awards were exchanged with   0.8 million   service based awards of Western phantom stock. Upon vesting, Western may settle these awards in common stock, cash or a combination of both, in the discretion of the board of directors of Western or its applicable committee. The new Western phantom stock awards participate in dividends on an equal basis with Western's common shareholders. However, dividends for phantom stock awards are paid in cash only upon vesting. In the event that unvested phantom stock awards are forfeited or canceled, any unpaid dividends on the underlying awards are also forfeited by the grantee. For phantom stock awards outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , the forfeiture rates ranged from   zero   to   30%  , depending on the employee pay grade classification.  
  Legacy NTI Performance-based Phantom Common Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   performance-based phantom common units outstanding as all performance-based phantom common units were exchanged in accordance with the Merger. Western issued (a) fixed-value cash denominated awards for the pre-merger time period pertaining to the legacy NTI performance-based phantom common unit awards based upon the performance multiples achieved through March 31, 2016 (the most recently completed quarter prior to the Merger date) and (b) variable-value cash denominated awards for the post-merger time period pertaining to the legacy NTI performance-based phantom common unit awards. Both the fixed value and variable value awards were converted to cash denominated awards at a rate of   $21.1049   in cash for every   one   unvested outstanding performance-based phantom common unit prior to the Merger. 
  Pre-Merger Period Service-Based Cash Denominated Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Western had   $4.4 million   in unvested fixed value, cash denominated awards applicable to the Company's pre-merger period ("Legacy Performance Awards"). The vesting dates of the Legacy Performance Awards remained unchanged and are now subject only to service conditions. These awards have a weighted average term until maturity of   1.3   years. The related expense is amortized over the remaining service period using the straight-line method and recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. In the event that unvested Legacy Performance Awards are forfeited or canceled, all dividend rights associated with the grant are also forfeited by the grantee. The forfeiture rates on the Legacy Performance Awards range from   5%   to   20%  , depending on the employee's pay grade classification.  
  Post-Merger Period Performance-Based Cash Denominated Awards 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Western had   $4.6 million   in unvested variable value, cash denominated awards applicable to the Company's post-merger period (the "Performance Cash Award"). Assuming a threshold EBITDA is achieved and the participant meets the service conditions throughout the vesting term, participants are entitled to a payout under the Performance Cash Award based on the Company s achievement of   two   criteria compared to the performance peer group selected by the compensation committee of Western's board of directors over the performance period: (a) return on capital employed, referred to as a performance condition, and (b) total shareholder return, referred to as a market condition. The average of these   two   conditions is then multiplied by a third condition relating to Western's average safety rate over the performance period relative to the comparable average safety rate of the refining industry as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and can range between   85%   for relatively poor safety performance to   115%   for relatively superior safety performance.   
  The Company accounts for the performance and market conditions in each Performance Cash Award as separate liability awards and remeasures the expected liability each period.

15  . EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  Defined Contribution Plans 
  The Company sponsors   one   qualified defined contribution plan for eligible employees. Eligibility is based upon a minimum age requirement and a minimum level of service. Participants may make contributions of a percentage of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Service limits. In   2016  , the Company provides a non-matching contribution of   3.0%   of eligible compensation and a matching contribution at the rate of   100%   of a participant s contribution up to   6.0%  . Total Company contributions to the Retirement Savings Plans were   $1.8 million   and   $1.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6.0 million   and   $5.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Cash Balance Plan 
  The Company sponsors a defined benefit cash balance pension plan (the  Cash Balance Plan ) for eligible employees. Company contributions are made to the cash account of the participants equal to   5.0%   of eligible compensation. Participants  cash accounts also receive interest credits each year based upon the average   thirty  -year United States Treasury bond rate published in September preceding the respective plan year. Participants become fully-vested in their accounts after   three years   of service. The net periodic benefit cost related to the Cash Balance Plan for both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $0.6 million   and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $1.8 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, related primarily to current period service costs.

The Company commenced a tender offer to repurchase the 2020 Secured Notes on October 17, 2016, and such offer expires on November 15, 2016. Any cash remaining after the offer to repurchase expires will become unrestricted and available for general corporate purposes.  
  
    107 

17  . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company is the subject of, or party to, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters. Certain of these matters are discussed below. While the results of these commitments and contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the final resolution of the foregoing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
  Legal Matters 
  On February 20, 2015, a customer served a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiff purports to bring the action also on behalf of others similarly situated and seeks statutory penalties, injunctive relief, and other remedies. The Company is vigorously defending itself. 
  On August 24, 2016, an alleged NTI unitholder ( Plaintiff ) filed a purported class action lawsuit against Western, NTI, NTI GP, members of the NTI GP board of directors at the time of the Merger, Evercore Group, L.L.C. ( Evercore ), and MergerCo (collectively,  Defendants ) (the  Merger Litigation ). The Merger Litigation appears to challenge the adequacy of disclosures made in connection with the Merger. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and attorneys  fees. The Merger Litigation is in the earliest stages of litigation.  The Company believes the Merger Litigation is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it. 
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accruals for remediation and closure obligations totaled   $7.6 million   and   $8.6 million  , respectively. Of the   $7.6 million   and   $8.6 million   accrued,   $2.4 million   and   $2.6 million   are recorded on a discounted basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These discounted liabilities are expected to be settled over at least the next   21   years. At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated future cash flows to settle these discounted liabilities totaled   $2.9 million  , and are discounted at a rate of   2.03%  . Receivables for recoverable costs from the state, under programs to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail marketing outlets, and others were   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Costs associated with environmental remediation are recorded in direct operating expenses in the statement of operations. 
  On June 3, 2014, SPPR was issued a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Permit/State Disposal System Permit by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") relating to its upgraded wastewater treatment plant at its St. Paul Park refinery. This permit required the refinery to conduct additional testing of its remaining lagoon. The testing was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and following the Company's review of the test results and additional discussions with the MPCA, the Company plans to close the remaining lagoon. The MPCA accepted the Company's remediation plan in the fourth quarter of 2015. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company estimates the remaining remediation costs to be approximately   $5.2 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively. In connection with the Company's December 2010 acquisition of the St. Paul Park refinery, among other assets, from Marathon Petroleum Company LP ("Marathon"), the Company entered into an agreement with Marathon which required Marathon to share in the future remediation costs of this Lagoon, should they be required. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with Marathon and received   $3.5 million   pursuant to this settlement which was recorded as a reduction of direct operating expenses. 
  Franchise Agreements 
  In the normal course of its business, SAF enters into   ten  -year license agreements with the operators of franchised SuperAmerica brand retail outlets. These agreements obligate SAF or its affiliates to provide certain services including information technology support, maintenance, credit card processing and signage for specified monthly fees. 
   
  18  . SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company has   two   reportable operating segments: Refining and Retail. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. The segment disclosures reflect management s current organizational structure. 
             
    Refining   operates the St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery, terminal, NTOT and related assets, and includes the Company s interest in MPL and MPLI, and 
                
    Retail   operates   170   convenience stores primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The retail segment also includes the operations of NTB and SAF. 
     
    108 

Operating results for the Company s operating segments are as follows: 

109 

Intersegment sales from the refining segment to the retail segment consist primarily of sales of refined products which are recorded based on contractual prices that are market-based. Revenues from external customers are nearly all in the United States. 
   
  Total assets by segment were as follows:    

Total assets for the refining and retail segments exclude all intercompany balances. All cash and cash equivalents are included in Other. All property, plant and equipment are located in the United States. 
   
  19  . MERGER TRANSACTION 
  Description of the Transaction 
  On December 21, 2015, Western entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among Western, MergerCo, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, the general partner of NTI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ( NTI GP ). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, MergerCo merged with and into NTI, the separate limited liability company existence of MergerCo ceased and NTI continued to exist, as a limited partnership under Delaware law and as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, as the surviving entity in the Merger.  
  Prior to the Merger, NT InterHoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Western ("NT InterHoldCo"), owned   100%   of the membership interests in NTI GP and   38.3%   of NTI s outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in NTI ( NTI Common Units ). NT InterHoldCo also owned   100%   of the membership interests in Western Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and holder of   100%   of the membership interests in MergerCo ( MergerCo HoldCo ). Following the Merger, NTI GP remained the sole general partner of NTI, the NTI Common Units held by Western and its subsidiaries were unchanged and remained issued and outstanding, and, by virtue of the Merger, all of the membership interests in MergerCo automatically converted into the number of NTI Common Units (excluding any NTI Common Units owned by Western and its subsidiaries) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Consequently, NT InterHoldCo and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MergerCo HoldCo, became the sole limited partners of NTI.  
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Western paid   $859.9 million   in cash and issued   17.1 million   shares of Western Common Stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. NTI common unitholders made consideration elections that resulted in the following allocation of cash and Western common stock among NTI common unitholders. 
             
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Mixed Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or who made no election, received   $15.00   in cash and   0.2986   of a share of Western Common Stock for each such NTI common unit held. 
     
    110 

NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Cash Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   $15.357   in cash and   0.28896   of a share of Western Common Stock, prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held.  
                
    NTI common unitholders who made a valid  Stock Election  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) received   0.7036   of a share of Western Common Stock for each such NTI common unit held.  
     Merger and Reorganization expenses 
  The Company incurred professional service fees in connection with the Merger transaction. Additionally, the Company incurred costs associated with initiating a plan of reorganization for various positions in the third quarter of 2016.  In relation to this reorganization plan, it was determined that certain employees would be terminated during 2016 and 2017. The Company recognized   $1.5 million   and   $2.6 million   of expense during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which included compensation related to the severance of employment and retention bonuses for selected employees. These costs are recognized in the merger-related expenses line within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. All reorganization and related costs are recognized in the Other segment. The Company recognizes these costs ratably from September 1, 2016, the effective date of the agreements, through the remaining service period, which varies for each employee, but in no case is later than September 1, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company anticipates that these costs will continue to be recognized through the third quarter of 2017 and for the expenses to be completely paid out by December 31, 2017. 
  The following table summarizes the merger-related expense activity for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

  NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations contained herein, the Company and Executive agree as follows, effective as of the Effective Date: 
  ARTICLE 1 
  DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS 
  Section 1.01.        Definitions.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is a  specified employee  on the date of his  separation from service  (each term as defined in Section 409A of the Code), as determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in the payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to Executive) until the date that is at least six (6) months following Executive s separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date permitted under Section 409A of the Code), whereupon the Company will pay Executive a lump-sum amount equal to the cumulative amounts that would have otherwise been previously paid to Executive under this Agreement during the period in which such payments or benefits were deferred.
