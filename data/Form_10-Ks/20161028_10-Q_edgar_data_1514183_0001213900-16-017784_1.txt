NOTE
1 -  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS    

Point
Capital, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of New York on July 13, 2010. On January 24, 2013, the
Company changed its state of incorporation from New York to Delaware.  

On
October 4, 2013, the Company filed a Form N-54A and elected to become a Business Development Company ( BDC ) under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). In addition, we have elected to be treated for federal
income tax purpose, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company, or ( RIC ), under Subchapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (the  Code ).  

The
Company s investment objective is to provide current income and capital appreciation. The Company intends to accomplish
its objective by investing in the common stock, preferred stock, warrants and convertible notes of small and mid-cap companies.
 The Company s investments are made principally through direct investments in prospective
portfolio companies.  However, the Company may also purchase securities in private secondary transactions. The Company
to a lesser extent will also invest in private companies that meet its investment objectives. The Company meets the definition
of an investment company in accordance with the guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946   Financial
Services       Investment Companies .     

On
March 27, 2014, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Hemp Funding, Inc., to invest in companies that are positioned
for growth in the legal cannabis industry. The subsidiary has not made any investments to date.  

Since
November 27, 2015, the Company s investment activities are managed by Eric Weisblum, the Company s chief executive
officer. Prior to November 27, 2015, the Company s investment activities were managed by Richard Brand, the Company s
former chief executive officer.     

NOTE
2 -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis
of presentation and principles of consolidation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the financial statements of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Hemp Funding, Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  

All
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September
30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been included. The results
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year. The accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have
been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which are
contained in the Company s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on June
14, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, contained herein, was derived from those consolidated financial
statements.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least
reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date
of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one
or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.  Management
estimates expected term of share options and similar instruments, expected volatility of the Company s common shares and
the method used to estimate it, expected annual rate of quarterly dividends, and risk free rate(s) to value share options and
similar instruments.

2 -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.
The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company s accounts at these institutions
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000 or by the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation ( SIPC ) up to $250,000. At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash balances exceeding the FDIC and SIPC
insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the
Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. The carrying amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair market value based on the short-term
maturity of these instruments.  

Securities
Transactions   

Securities
transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Securities transactions outside conventional channels, such as private transactions,
are recorded as of the date the Company obtains the right to demand the securities purchased or to collect the proceeds from a
sale, and incurs an obligation to pay for securities purchased or to deliver securities sold, respectively. The Company records
interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts. Commissions and
other costs associated with transactions involving securities, including legal costs, are included in the cost basis of purchases
and deducted from the proceeds of sales.  

Realized
Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Portfolio Investments   

Realized
gain or loss is recognized when an investment is disposed of and is computed as the difference between the Company's cost basis
and the net proceeds received from such disposition.  Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined
by specific identification. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation is computed as the difference between the fair
value of the investment and the cost basis of such investment, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation/depreciation
when gains or losses are realized.  

Valuation
of Investments    

Our
investments consist of loans and securities issued by public and privately-held companies, including convertible debt, loans,
equity warrants and preferred and common equity securities.  

The
Company applies the accounting guidance of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures 
( ASC 820 ).  This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining
the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal
or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would
use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.  

The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:  

Level
    1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2 -   Valuations based on inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
    such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
    liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Valuation
of Investments (continued)   

Level
    3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement
    date. The inputs for the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and is based
    upon management s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
    These investments include debt and equity investments in private companies or assets valued using the market or income approach
    and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful
    current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs in these valuations may include, but are not limited
    to, capitalization and discount rates, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA )
    multiples, and discounts for lack of marketability.   

On
a quarterly basis, The Board of Directors (the  Board ) of the Company, in good faith, determines the fair value of
investments in the following manner:  

Equity
securities which are listed on a recognized stock exchange are valued at the closing trade price on the last trading day of the
valuation period. For equity securities that carry a restriction inherent to the security, a restriction discount is applied,
as appropriate. Investments in warrants are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Investments in
securities which are convertible at a date in the future are valued assuming a full conversion into common shares and valued based
on the methodology for equity securities described above, or at the respective investment s face value, whichever is a better
indicator of fair value. Investments in unlisted securities are valued using a market approach net of the appropriate discount
for lack of marketability.  

Investments
without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches,
as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical
or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts
(for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated
by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Company
may take into account in fair value pricing the Company's investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including
relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants,
call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability
to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons
of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors.  

Because
there is not a readily available market value for some of the investments in its portfolio, the Company values certain of its
portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by its board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of
the Company's investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company's investments may differ
significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments and may differ
materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and
other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate
a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the
Company has recorded it.

Portfolio
Company Investment Classification   

The
Company classifies its portfolio company investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act.  Under the
1940 Act,  Controlled Investments  are defined as investments in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting
securities or has rights to nominate greater than 50% of the board representation.  Under the 1940 Act,  Affiliated
Investments  are defined as investments in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities.  Under
the 1940 Act,  Non-Controlled/Non-Affiliated Investments  are defined as investments that are neither Controlled Investments
nor Affiliated Investments.   At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any Controlled or Affiliated investments.   

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company records interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax
treatment applicable to RICs.  

In
order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Company is required to distribute annually to its stockholders at least
90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code. To avoid federal excise taxes, the Company must distribute
annually at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of net capital gains from the current year and any undistributed ordinary
income and net capital gains from the preceding years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess
of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, all other things being
equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue
excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required.  

Distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent
in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are charged or credited to paid-in-capital in excess of par or
accumulated net realized loss, as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are
primarily attributable to differences in the tax characterization of income or loss and any non-deductible expenses. These differences
are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Company s annual RIC tax return.   

Reclassification   

A
certain reclassification has been made in the prior year s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s
financial presentation. This reclassification had no effect on net loss or cash flows as previously reported.

    impacting Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning
    of the period in which the reclassifications occur.

4 -  REDEEMABLE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK    

In
April 2013, pursuant to a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Preferred Stock Agreement ), the Company
issued 4,000 shares of Series A, Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Preferred Stock ) for $400,000. Holders of Preferred
Stock vote together with holders of Common Stock on an as-converted basis. Each share is currently convertible into 500 shares
of common stock at the option of the holder (subject to a 9.99% beneficial ownership limitation) based on a conversion formula
(the Stated Value, currently $100, divided by the Conversion Rate, currently $0.20.) The Conversion Rate may be adjusted upon

NOTE
4 -  REDEEMABLE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (continued)     

The
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain  triggering
events.  In case of a triggering event, the holder has the right to redeem each share held for cash (currently $100/share)
or impose a dividend rate on all of the outstanding Preferred Stock at 6% per annum thereafter. A triggering event occurs if the
Company fails to deliver certificates representing conversion shares, fails to pay the amount due pursuant to a Buy-In, fails
to have available a sufficient number of authorized shares, fails to observe any covenant in the Certificate of Designation unless
cured within 30 calendar days, shall be party to a Change in Control Transaction, sustains a bankruptcy event, fails to list or
quote its common stock for more than 20 trading days in a twelve-month period, sustains any monetary judgment, writ or similar
final process filed against the Company for more than $100,000 and such judgment writ or similar final process shall remain unvacated,
unbonded or unstayed for a period of 45 calendar days, or fails to comply with the Asset Coverage requirement.  

Because
certain of these  triggering events  are outside the control of the Company, the Preferred Stock is classified within
the temporary equity section of the statement of assets and liabilities.  

Pursuant
to the Preferred Stock Agreement, the Company agreed that as long as the purchasers of its Series A Preferred Stock are holding
said shares, the Company would comply in all respects with our reporting and filing obligations under the Exchange Act.  The
Company did not file its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its quarterly reports for the period ended March
31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, in a timely manner. The Company is currently not in breach of its agreement to remain current. The
purchase agreement does not provide for any immediate consequence or default provision such as a reduction in the conversion price
of the Series A Preferred, immediate redemption or the like.  

The
Preferred Stock has forced conversion rights where the Company may force the conversion of the Preferred Stock if certain conditions
are met. The Company may elect to redeem some or all of the outstanding Preferred Stock for the Stated Value (currently $100/share)
provided that proper notice is provided to the holders and that a number of conditions (the  Equity Conditions ) have
been met.  

If
any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and the Company is a Business Development Company, the Company shall have asset
coverage of at least 200% as of the close of business on the last business day of a calendar quarter. If the Company fails to
comply with this requirement and it is not cured on a timely basis, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act
and Delaware law, proceed to redeem a sufficient number of shares of Preferred Stock (at $100/share plus any unpaid dividends
and distributions) to meet is asset coverage requirement.  

The
Company believes the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the Preferred Stock of $400,000 approximates
the fair market value of such Preferred Stock based on the short-term maturity of these instruments which also equals the redemption
value reflected as on the consolidated balance sheets.   

NOTE
5    CONCENTRATIONS AND CREDIT RISKS    

Financial
instruments that subjected the Company to concentrations of market risk consisted principally of equity investments and debt instruments
(other than cash equivalents), which collectively represented approximately 58.6% and 69.0% of the Company s total assets
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These investments consist of certain securities in companies with no
readily determinable market values or in non-public companies, and as such are valued in accordance with the Company s fair
value policies and procedures. The Company s investment strategy represents a high degree of business and financial risk
due to the fact that certain of the Company s portfolio investments (other than cash equivalents) are generally illiquid,
in small and middle market companies, and include entities with little operating history or entities that possess operations in
new or developing industries. Investments in non-public entities , should they become publicly traded, would generally be (i) subject
to restrictions on resale, if they were acquired from the issuer in private placement transactions; and (ii) susceptible
to market risk.  Additionally, the Company is classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the
1940 Act, and therefore may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of portfolio companies, which
gives rise to a risk of significant loss should the performance or financial condition of one or more portfolio companies deteriorate.

Forward-Looking
Statements   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q
(the  Report ). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial
performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  should ,
 expects ,  plans ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,
 potential , or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements
are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry s
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  

While
these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current
judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates,
predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including
the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Overview   

We
are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ).  As a business development company, we
are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.  For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70%
of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents,
U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are treated for tax purposes
as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ),
and intends to qualify thereafter.    

Investment
Strategy   

We
seek to invest in companies that are asset rich and generating cash flow on a sustainable basis. Further, when identifying prospective
portfolio companies, we seek the following attributes, which we believe will help us generate higher total returns with an acceptable
level of risk. These attributes are:  

Strong
    management teams with meaningful equity ownership.  We will seek experienced management teams with an established track
    record of success in place or available. We will typically require the portfolio companies to have proper incentives to align
    management s goals with ours. Generally, we will seek companies in which the management teams have significant equity
    interests.   

Secure
    market positions that present attractive growth opportunities.  We will seek companies that we believe possess advantages
    in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing, or product quality versus their competitors, minimizing sales risk and
    generating margins that can be readily forecast.   

Industries
    with favorable trends.    We will seek industries with favorable industry trends and companies performing well
    within their industries and poised to benefit from a catalyst.   

Investing
    in private companies . We do not expect to invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans.  We
    may also consider companies that are underperforming compared to their potential due to structural impediments with opportunities
    to restructure and refocus strategy and resources.     

Diversification .
    We will seek to diversify our portfolio among companies engaged in a variety of industries, thereby potentially reducing the
    risk of a downturn in any one industry having a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio. We cannot assure you
    that we will be successful in this regard.   

Structure
    financing terms to limit down side risk.    Originating our own lending opportunities through our network will
    permit us to structure loans to enhance the element of capital preservation for our stockholders.   

Private
    equity sponsorship . Often we will seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what we believe to be high-quality
    private equity firms. Point Capital s senior management team believes that a private equity sponsor s willingness
    to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company provides an additional level of due diligence investigation and
    is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, by co-investing with quality private equity firms which
    commit significant sums of equity capital with junior priority to our future debt investments, we may benefit from having
    due diligence on our investments performed by both parties.   

Viable
    exit strategy . We intend to focus our investment activity primarily in companies whose business models and growth prospects
    offer attractive exit possibilities, including repayment of our investments, with the potential for capital gain on any equity
    interest we hold through an initial public offering of common stock, a merger, a sale or other recapitalization. See  Investment
    Objectives and Strategy.    

We
plan to be the lead investor for transactions, as well as a co-investor with investment institutions for other transactions. Moreover,
we may acquire investments in the secondary loan market, and, in analyzing such investments, we will employ the same analytical
process that we use for our primary investments.

Results

income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating
expenses.  Net realized gain (loss), if any, is the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition of portfolio
company securities and their stated cost.  Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from investments is the net change
in the fair value of our investment portfolio.  

Investment
Income:    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we earned interest and dividend income of $11,256
and $11,606, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we earned interest and dividend income of $40,789 and
$24,448, respectively, primarily resulting from interest earned on convertible debt and other debt, and dividend income earned
on convertible preferred stock. The increase was attributable to an increase in income-earning investments and the recording of
a $5,000 fee which was included in interest income in the 2016 period related to the extension of the due date of a debenture
until December 2016.  

Operating
Expenses:   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total operating expenses consisted of the following:  

Compensation
expense: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred compensation expense of $40,000 and $97,500 consisting
of directors fees of $7,500 and $22,500, fees incurred for services performed by our outsourced chief financial officer of $15,000
and $45,000, $7,500 and $20,000 in fees incurred for services performed by our outsourced chief compliance officer, and $10,000
and $10,000 incurred for services of our chief executive officer, as compared to directors fees of $12,554 and $62,757, and fees
incurred for services performed by our outsourced chief financial officer of $11,613 and $11,613 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Professional
fees: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional fees increased by $26,551 or 296.4%, and $146,167 or
194.6% as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These increases was attributable to an increase in accounting
fees of $24,840 and $64,607 related to an increase in audit and review fees, an increase in legal fees of $1,711 and $75,560 related
to our Investment Act matters, and an increase in consulting fees of $0 and $6,000, respectively.  

Filing
fees: Filing fees consist consists of fees incurred to file reports with the securities and exchange commission and other miscellaneous
filing fees, For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, filing fees increased (decreased) by $60 and $(4,543) as
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Insurance
expense: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, insurance expense increased (decreased) by $32, and by $(1,851)
as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

General
and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses consist of transfer agent fees, custodian fees, bank service
charges, listing fees, and other fees and expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative
expenses increased by $5,075 or 167.9%, and $12,886 or 134.2% as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
These increases were primarily attributable to an increase in custody fees of $2,500 and $7,500, and an increase in broker fees
of $2,867 and $2,934, respectively.  

Net
Investment loss:   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net investment loss amount to $81,841 and
$33,939, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net investment loss amount to $326,829 and
$167,381, respectively.  

Net
Realized And Unrealized (Loss) Gain On Investments:    

Net
Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments:   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we disposed of certain
investment positions and recognized a net realized gain of $131 and $23,400, respectively. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we disposed of certain investment positions and recognized a net realized gain (loss) of $59,220 and $(54,515),
respectively.  

Net
Change in Unrealized Loss on Investments  : At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a cost basis in our portfolio
companies of $1,657,060 and $1,838,189 with a fair market value of $843,848 and $1,691,518, respectively. The net change in unrealized
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $349,795 and $486,125, respectively. The net change in unrealized
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $666,541 and $194,391, respectively.  

Net
Decrease in Net Assets Resulting from Operations   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the net decrease
in net assets resulting from operations was $431,505 and $460,844, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was $969,970 and $416,287, respectively. Unrealized losses
related to a decrease in value of warrants of approximately $313,000 and a decrease in value of common and preferred shares of
approximately $302,000 at June 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $542,955 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $722,764 as of December 31, 2015, a decrease
of $179,809. This decrease was primarily attributable to the use of cash for operating activities of $391,490 and for the purchase
of investments of $255,726 offset by net proceeds from the sale of investments of $467,407.  

The
Company believes that our existing available cash will enable the Company to meet its working capital requirements for at least
12 months.  

The
Company has no agreements or arrangements to raise capital. In 2013 and through March 2014, we raised funds from the sale of our
common stock of approximately $2,604,000 (net of direct offering costs paid in cash were $231,190) in accordance with the terms
of a 2013 placement agency agreement.  

Since
inception we have funded our operations and the purchase of our investments primarily through equity financings and we expect
that we will continue to fund our operations through the equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances.
Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We intend to continue to fund our business by way of equity
or debt financing until realized gains on our investments can support our operations. If we raise additional capital through the
issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will
be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the
working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  

Although
we believe that our existing available cash will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least 12 months, we
may need to raise additional funds to continue investing in portfolio companies. If we are unable to raise capital, we may be
required to reduce the scope of our investment activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating
results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you will lose all of your investment.  

We
currently have no commitments with any person for any capital expenditures.   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, ( U.S. GAAP ).  We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Hemp Funding, Inc.,
to invest in companies that are positioned for growth in the legal cannabis industry. The subsidiary has not made investments
to date. The Company consolidates the subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

We
consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to
be cash equivalents.  

Securities
Transactions   

Securities
transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Securities transactions outside conventional channels, such as private transactions,
are recorded as of the date the Company obtains the right to demand the securities purchased or to collect the proceeds from a
sale, and incurs an obligation to pay for securities purchased or to deliver securities sold, respectively. We record interest
and dividend income on an accrual basis beginning on the trade settlement date (the date on which a financial transaction is settled
and monies from the transaction have occurred) or the ex-dividend date, respectively, to the extent that we expect to collect
such amounts. Commissions and other costs associated with transactions involving securities, including legal costs, are included
in the cost basis of purchases and deducted from the proceeds of sales.  

Net
Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments   

Realized
gain or loss is recognized when an investment is disposed of and is computed as the difference between the Company's cost basis
and the net proceeds received from such disposition.  Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined
by specific identification. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation is computed as the difference between the fair
value of the investment and the cost basis of such investment.  

Valuation
of Investments   

Our
investments consist of loans and securities issued by public and privately-held companies, including convertible debt, loans,
equity warrants and preferred and common equity securities.  

We
apply the accounting guidance of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures 
( ASC 820 ).  This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining
the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.  

The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:  

Level
    1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2 -   Valuations based on inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
    such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
    liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level
    3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement
    date. The inputs for the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and is based
    upon management s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
    These investments include debt and equity investments in private companies or assets valued using the market or income approach
    and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful
    current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs in these valuations may include, but are not limited
    to, capitalization and discount rates, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA )
    multiples, and discounts for lack of marketability.   

On
a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors (the  Board ) of the Company, in good faith, determines the fair value of
investments in the following manner:  

Equity
securities which are listed on a recognized stock exchange are valued at the closing trade price on the last trading day of the
valuation period. For equity securities that carry a restriction inherent to the security, a restriction discount is applied,
as appropriate. Investments in warrants are valued at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on inputs
such as stock volatility, risk-free interest rates, holding period and dividend yield. Investments in securities which are convertible
at a date in the future are valued assuming a full conversion into common shares and valued based on the methodology for equity
securities described above, or at the respective investment s face value, whichever is a better indicator of fair value.
Investments in unlisted securities are valued using a market approach net of the appropriate discount for lack of marketability.  

Investments
without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches,
as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical
or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts
(for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated
by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take
into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and
applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection
provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments,
its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios
of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors.  

Because
there is not a readily available market value for some of the investments in its portfolio, we value substantially all of our
portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of
our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly
from the values that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments and may differ materially
from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions
on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment
in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.  

Revenue
Recognition     

We
record interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We do not accrue
as a receivable interest on debt or dividend of preferred shares for accounting purposes if there is reason to doubt the ability
to collect such interest.  

Income
Taxes   

We
are treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Generally, a RIC is exempt from federal income
taxes if it distributes at least 90% of   Investment Company Taxable Income,   as defined in the Code,
each year. Dividends paid up to one year after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining
the dividends paid in such tax year. We intend to distribute sufficient dividends to maintain its RIC status each year. We are
also subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes if we do not distribute at least 98% of net ordinary income each calendar year,
98.2% of capital gain net income for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year, if any, and any recognized
and undistributed income from prior years for which we paid no federal income taxes. We will generally endeavor each year to avoid
any federal excise taxes.  

We
account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance FASB ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes ,  which requires
that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.
A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

We
did not have any distributable income as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Item
3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

During
the normal course of its business, the Company trades various financial instruments and enters into various financial transactions
where the risk of potential loss due to market risk, credit risk and other risks can equal or exceed the related amounts recorded.
The success of any investment activity is influenced by general economic conditions that may affect the level and volatility of
equity prices, interest rates and the extent and timing of investor participation in the markets for both equity and interest
rate sensitive investments. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which the Company directly or indirectly holds
positions could impair its ability to carry out its business and could cause losses to be incurred.  

Market
risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by increases or decreases in the fair value of investments resulting from
market fluctuations.  

Credit
risk represents the potential loss that would occur if counterparties fail to perform pursuant to the terms of their obligations.
In addition to its investments, the Company is subject to credit risk to the extent a custodian or broker with whom it conducts
business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations.  

Item
4.   Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, who is also our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
ineffective at such time to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded
that our disclosure controls, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, was inappropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

During
the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established
in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
( COSO ), Management identified the following deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting:  

our
    failure to timely recognize that we issued shares to a consultant in 2014 and stock options to directors in 2015 in contravention
    of Section 23(a) of the Investment Act of 1940,    

the
    lack of Investment Act experienced internal staff,    

a
    lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions.    

a
    lack of control over custodian of certain instruments.    

a
    lack of control over valuation of certain investments.    

As
of September 30, 2016, we concluded that such weaknesses continue to exist.  

Remediation
Plans    

We
have initiated several steps and plan to continue to evaluate and implement measures designed to improve our internal control
over financial reporting in order to remediate the control deficiencies noted above.  

In
    January 2016, the Company hired a chief compliance officer to ensure that the Company remains in full compliance of the Investment
    Company Act of 1940 and administer the policies and procedures we created for the purpose of ensuring our compliance with
    federal securities laws (principally, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment
    Act of 1940).    

Due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.
However, to the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets
and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals.  

In
light of these material weaknesses, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our consolidated
financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated
in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our consolidated financial
statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.

      I
    have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Point Capital, Inc.(the  registrant ) for the period ended
    September 30, 2016;    

2.
      
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;    

3.
      
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;    

4.
      
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s), and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:    

a.
      
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

b.
      
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

c.
      
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and    

d.
      
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and    

5.
      
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer, and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
    over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):    

a.
      
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and    

b.
      
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
