1.  
    Nature of operations 
     Headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, Univar Inc. ( the Company  or  Univar ) is a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals. The Company s operations are structured into   four   operating segments that represent the geographic areas under which the Company manages its business: 
             
    Univar USA ( USA ) 
                
    Univar Canada ( Canada ) 
                
    Univar Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) 
                
    Rest of World ( Rest of World ) 
     Rest of World includes certain developing businesses in Latin America (including Brazil and Mexico) and the Asia-Pacific region.

    Basis of presentation 
     The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) as applicable to interim financial reporting. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial data presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars. These condensed consolidated financial statements, in the Company s opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and changes in stockholders  equity. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated if the Company has a controlling financial interest, which may exist based on ownership of a majority of the voting interest, or based on the Company s determination that it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ( VIE ) or if otherwise required by US GAAP. The Company did not have any material interests in variable interest entities during the periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

    Recent accounting pronouncements 
     Accounting pronouncements issued and adopted 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events that will alleviate the substantial doubt are adequately disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted and the Company has elected to adopt the ASU as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  (Topic 810). The core principle of the guidance is to provide amendments to the current consolidation guidance. The revised consolidation guidance, among other things, modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. This guidance

     Table of Contents  

is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has elected to adopt the ASU as of January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04  Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets)  (Topic 715). The core principle of the guidance is that it provides a practical expedient for companies to measure interim remeasurements for significant events that occur on other than a month-end date. The guidance permits entities to remeasure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end date that is closest to the date of the significant event. The decision to apply the practical expedient to interim remeasurements for significant events can be made for each significant event. This guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has elected to adopt the ASU as of January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-use software (Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  (Subtopic 350-40). The ASU provides customers with guidance on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has elected to adopt the ASU as of January 1, 2016 and the ASU is applied prospectively to all arrangements entered that occur after the effective date. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" (Topic 330). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should measure inventory at the "lower of cost and net realizable value" and options that currently exist for "market value" will be eliminated. The ASU defines net realizable value as the "estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation." This guidance is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those financial years. Early adoption is permitted and the Company has elected to adopt the ASU as of June 30, 2016. The ASU is applied prospectively and the adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  Accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (Topic 718)    Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The core principal of the guidance is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within such fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company does not expect a significant impact to its consolidated financial statements when it adopts this ASU. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" (Topic 326) - "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The ASU requires entities to use a Current Expected Credit Loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  Under the model, an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The entity's estimate would consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which will result in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses upon initial recognition of the related assets. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within such  fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its internal processes, operating results and financial reporting.  The impact is currently not known or reasonably estimable. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230) -  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The ASU clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current guidance; and therefore, reduces the current diversity in practice. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within such fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect any impact to its consolidated statement of operations or consolidated balance sheet since the ASU only addresses classification items within the statement of cash flows.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 "Income Taxes" (Topic 740) - "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory." The ASU eliminates the exception that prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party for assets other than inventory. The standard will be effective

for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within such fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not yet been issued. The Company does not expect a significant impact to its consolidated financial statements when it adopts this ASU.

    Restructuring charges 
     Restructuring charges relate to the implementation of several regional strategic initiatives aimed at streamlining the Company s cost structure and improving its operations. These actions primarily resulted in workforce reductions, lease termination costs and other facility rationalization costs.  The following table presents cost information related to restructuring plans that have not been completed as of   September 30, 2016   and does not contain any estimates for plans that may be developed and implemented in future periods. 

The following table summarizes activity related to accrued liabilities associated with redundancy and restructuring: 

Restructuring liabilities of   $18.8 million   and   $34.5 million   were classified as current in other accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The long-term portion of restructuring liabilities of   $12.4 million   and   $12.1 million   were recorded in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and primarily consists of facility exit costs that are expected to be paid within the next   eight years  . 
  While the Company believes the recorded restructuring liabilities are adequate, revisions to current estimates may be recorded in future periods based on new information as it becomes available.

    Income taxes 
     The Company s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, an estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated should management revise its forecast of earnings based upon the Company s operating results. If there is a change in the estimated effective annual tax rate, a cumulative adjustment is made. The quarterly tax provision and forecast estimate of the annual effective tax rate may be subject to volatility due to several factors, including the complexity in forecasting jurisdictional earnings before tax, the rate of realization of forecasting earnings or losses by quarter, acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency gains and losses, pension gains and losses, etc. 
  The income tax benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $44.6 million   and   $38.6 million  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   41.4%   and   80.8%  , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   higher than   the US federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the mix of earnings in multiple jurisdictions, non-taxable interest income and the release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax attributes. The Company s effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   higher than   the US federal statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in multiple jurisdictions, non-taxable interest income and the release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax attributes.  
  The income tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $7.6 million   and   $14.6 million  , resulting in an effective tax rate of   38.6%   and   42.9%  , respectively. The Company s effective tax rate for three months ended   September 30, 2015   was   higher than   the US federal statutory rate primarily due to the rate of realization of actual to forecasted earnings and losses, the interim accounting treatment of year to date losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit may not be recognized, and the mix of earnings in multiple jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   higher than   the US federal statutory rate primarily due to the rate of realization of actual to forecasted earnings and losses and losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which tax benefit may not be recognized offset by the mix of earnings in multiple jurisdictions and non-taxable interest income. 
  The Company believes it likely triggered an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the three months ended September, 2016. The ownership change will subject the Company's U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which may limit the ability to use them to offset taxable income in periods following the ownership change. The Company's analysis of the impact of the change in ownership is in process, however the Company does not currently believe the impact of the limitation is material to the consolidated financial statements.  
  Canadian General Anti-Avoidance Rule matters 
  In 2007, the outstanding shares of Univar N.V., the ultimate public company parent of the Univar group at that time, were acquired by investment funds     advised by CVC. To facilitate the acquisition and leveraged financing of Univar N.V. by CVC, a restructuring of some of the companies in the Univar group,     including its Canadian operating company, was completed (the  Restructuring ). In February 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) issued a Notice of     Assessment, asserting the General Anti-Avoidance Rule ( GAAR ) against the Company s subsidiary Univar Holdco Canada ULC ( Univar Holdco ) for withholding tax of   $29.4 million   (Canadian), relating to this Restructuring. Univar Holdco appealed the assessment, and the matter was litigated

     Table of Contents  

in the Tax Court of Canada in June 2015. On June 22, 2016, the Tax Court of Canada issued its judgment in favor of the CRA. The Company strongly disagrees with the decision of the Tax Court of Canada and filed its appeal to the Canadian  Court of Appeal on June 30, 2016.  The Company filed its Memorandum of Fact and Law with the Canadian Court of Appeal on October 6, 2016. A   $44.7 million   (Canadian) Letter of Credit, covering the initial assessment of   $29.4 million   (Canadian) and interest of   $15.3 million   (Canadian), has been issued with respect to this assessment. 
  In September 2014, also relating to the Restructuring, the CRA issued the 2008 and 2009 Notice of Reassessments for federal corporate income tax liabilities of   $11.9 million   (Canadian) and   $11.0 million   (Canadian), respectively, and a departure tax liability of   $9.0 million   (Canadian). Likewise, in April 2015, the Company s subsidiary received the 2008 and 2009 Alberta Notice of Reassessments of   $6.0 million   (Canadian) and   $5.8 million   (Canadian), respectively. These Reassessments reflect the additional tax liability and interest relating to those tax years should the CRA be successful in its assertion of the GAAR relating to the Restructuring described above. In September 2016, the CRA notified the Company that it agreed to accept security on the above reassessed federal amounts in the form of a Letter of Credit and subsequently the Company requested that it refrain from further collection efforts related to this assessment until the outcome of the appeal of the GAAR matter is concluded.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total Canadian federal and provincial tax liability assessed related to these matters, inclusive of interest of   $37.4 million   (Canadian), is   $110.5 million   (Canadian).   The Company has not recorded any liabilities for these matters in its financial statements, as it believes it is more likely than not that the ruling will be reversed on appeal and the Company s position will be sustained.

    Stock options to purchase   3.2 million   and   1.7 million   shares of common stock and restricted stock of   0.0 million   and   0.1 million    were outstanding during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, but were not included in the calculation of diluted income per share as the impact of these stock options would have been anti-dilutive. Stock options to purchase   4.0 million   and   1.7 million   shares of common stock and restricted stock of   0.0 million   and   0.0 million   were outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, but were not included in the calculation of diluted income per share as the impact of these stock options would have been anti-dilutive.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company revised its business operating plan for servicing upstream oil and gas customers in its USA operating segment.  In light of the current prolonged drop in oil prices, and consequential decrease in demand for certain products including high-value specialized blended products used in hydraulic fracking operations, the Company has narrowed its product line and service offering by curtailing certain highly specialized products and services that were being produced and sold to oil and gas customers.  As a result, the Company has ceased operations at three production facilities.  The Company determined that these decisions have resulted in a triggering event with respect to long lived assets in an asset group, resulting in the assessment of recoverability of these long lived assets.  The Company performed step one of the impairment test and determined the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows.  Thus, the Company proceeded to step two of the impairment test where it was required to determine the fair value of the asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeded the fair value. As a result of the impairment test, the Company recorded a non-cash, pretax long-lived asset impairment charge of   $113.7 million   related to intangible assets and   $16.5 million   related to property, plant and equipment within its condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded a non-cash, pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charge of   $0.3 million   related to assets held-for-sale.

     Table of Contents  

The fair value of the asset group was determined using an income approach, which was comprised of multiple significant unobservable inputs including: (1) the estimate of future cash flows; (2) the amount of capital expenditures required to maintain the existing cash flows; and (3) a terminal period growth rate equal to the expected rate of inflation. Accordingly, estimated fair value of the asset group is considered to be a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy.       
  In addition to the charges discussed above, the Company also impaired   $3.4 million   of inventory deemed to be unsaleable in connection with the facility closures.

    Fair value measurements 
     Items measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis on a gross basis: 

The net amounts relating to forward currency contracts included in prepaid and other current assets were   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   and included in other accrued expenses were   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by estimating the net present value of amounts to be paid under the agreement offset by the net present value of the expected cash inflows based on market rates and associated yield curves. Based on these valuation methodologies, these derivative contracts are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on a real options approach, which took into account management s best estimate of the acquiree s performance, as well as achievement risk. Based on the valuation methodology, contingent consideration is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value measurements that use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which consists of contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions. 

Financial instruments not carried at fair value 
  The estimated fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows: 

14 

     Table of Contents  

The fair values of the long-term debt, including the current portions, were based on current market quotes for similar borrowings and credit risk adjusted for liquidity, margins and amortization, as necessary. 
  Fair value of other financial instruments 
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, net, trade accounts payable and short-term financing included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 

Interest rate swaps 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had interest rate swap contracts in place with a total notional amount of   $1.0 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively, whereby a fixed rate of interest (weighted average of   1.64%  ) is paid and a variable rate of interest (greater of   1.25%   or three-month LIBOR) is received on the notional amount. The decrease in notional amount is due to certain swaps maturing during the second quarter of 2016. 
  The objective of the interest rate swap contracts is to offset the variability of cash flows in LIBOR indexed debt interest payments, subject to a   1.00%   floor, attributable to changes in the aforementioned benchmark interest rate related to the Term B Loan due 2022. 
  The fair value of interest rate swaps is recorded either in prepaids and other current assets, other assets, other accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the current liability of   $1.7 million   and   $5.3 million   was included in other accrued expenses, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the noncurrent liability of   $0.0 million   and   $0.5 million   was included in other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
  Interest rate caps 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had interest rate caps with a notional amount of   $800 million  , to the extent the quarterly LIBOR exceeded   1.00%  ; the Company would receive payment based on the notional amount and the spread of three month LIBOR above the strike price of   1.00%  . The Company does not apply hedge accounting for the interest rate caps, which expire on June 30, 2017.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , upfront premium paid for these interest rate caps of   $0.2 million   are recorded in prepaids and other current assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The interest rate cap premiums will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the contracts within the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Foreign currency derivatives 
  The Company uses forward currency contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the Company s intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments are not formally designated as hedges by the Company and the terms of these instruments range from   one   to   three   months. Forward currency contracts are recorded at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting their short-term nature. The fair value adjustments and gains and losses are included in other (expense) income, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer to  Note 7: Other (expense) income, net  for more information. The total notional amount of undesignated forward currency contracts were   $106.6 million   and   $107.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are recognized in the operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

    Business combinations 
     Acquisition of Bodine Services 
  On March 2, 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of   100%   of the equity interest in Bodine Services of Decatur, Inc.; Bodine Environmental Services, Inc.; and affiliated entities, operating as Bodine Services of the Midwest ( Bodine ), a regional provider of environmental and facilities maintenance services. This acquisition expands the Company s footprint with additional service centers in key geographic markets since Bodine has expertise that is critical to helping customers effectively manage compliance with their operations by preventing waste and environmental concerns.

Acquisition of Nexus Ag 
  On March 22, 2016, the Company completed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Nexus Ag Business Inc. ( Nexus Ag ), a wholesale fertilizer distributor to the Western Canada agriculture market that offers a broad range of products, including micronutrients, specialty fertilizers, potash, phosphates, and liquid and soluble nutrients from leading North American producers. 
  The preliminary purchase price of these acquisitions was   $53.3 million  . The preliminary purchase price allocation includes goodwill of   $23.2 million   and intangibles   $19.4 million  . The operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statement of the Company. The initial accounting for these acquisitions has only been preliminary determined subject to final working capital adjustments and valuations of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.   
  The purchase price allocation for the Key Chemical, Inc., Chemical Associates, Inc., Arrow Chemical, Inc., and Polymer Technologies Ltd. 2015 acquisitions are now final. Purchase price adjustments on prior acquisitions resulted in additional cash payments of   $1.5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   

17. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Litigation 
  In the ordinary course of business the Company is subject to pending or threatened claims, lawsuits, regulatory matters and administrative proceedings from time to time. Where appropriate the Company has recorded provisions in the consolidated financial statements for these matters. The liabilities for injuries to persons or property are in some instances covered by liability insurance, subject to various deductibles and self-insured retentions. 
  The Company is not aware of any claims, lawsuits, regulatory matters or administrative proceedings, pending or threatened, that are likely to have a material effect on its overall financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any claims or litigation or the potential for future claims or litigation. 
  The Company is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. The claims result primarily from an indemnification obligation related to Univar USA Inc. s 1986 purchase of McKesson Chemical Company from McKesson Corporation ( McKesson ). Univar USA is also a defendant in a small number of asbestos claims. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were fewer than   275   asbestos-related claims for which the Company has liability for defense and indemnity pursuant to the indemnification obligation. The volume of such cases has increased in recent quarters. Historically, the vast majority of the claims against both McKesson and Univar USA have been dismissed without payment. The Company does incur costs in defending these claims. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material effect on its overall financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of any present or future claims or litigation and adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period. 
  Environmental 
  The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively  environmental remediation work ) at approximately   131   locations, some that are now or were previously Company-owned/occupied and some that were never Company-owned/occupied ( non-owned sites ). 
  The Company s environmental remediation work at some sites is being conducted pursuant to governmental proceedings or investigations, while the Company, with appropriate state or federal agency oversight and approval, is conducting the environmental remediation work at other sites voluntarily. The Company is currently undergoing remediation efforts or is in the process of active review of the need for potential remediation efforts at approximately   103   current or formerly Company-owned/occupied sites. In addition, the Company may be liable for a share of the clean-up of approximately   28   non-owned sites. These non-owned sites are typically (a) locations of independent waste disposal or recycling operations with alleged or confirmed contaminated soil and/or groundwater to which the Company may have shipped waste products or drums for re-conditioning, or (b) contaminated non-owned sites near historical sites owned or operated by the Company or its predecessors from which contamination is alleged to have arisen. 
  In determining the appropriate level of environmental reserves, the Company considers several factors such as information obtained from investigatory studies; changes in the scope of remediation; the interpretation, application and enforcement of laws and regulations; changes in the costs of remediation programs; the development of alternative cleanup technologies and methods; and the relative level of the Company s involvement at various sites for which the Company is allegedly associated. The level of annual expenditures for remedial, monitoring and investigatory activities will change in the future as major components of planned remediation activities are completed and the scope, timing and costs of existing activities are changed. Project lives, and therefore cash flows, range from   2   to   30 years  , depending on the specific site and type of remediation project.

On December 9, 2014, the Company was issued a violation notice from the Pollution Control Services Department of Harris County, Texas ( PCS ). The notice relates to claims that the Company s facility on Luthe Road in Houston, Texas operated with inadequate air emissions controls and improperly discharged certain waste without authorization. On March 6, 2015, PCS notified the Company that the matter was forwarded to the Harris County District Attorney s Office with a request for an enforcement action. No such action has commenced.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not recorded a liability related to the PCS investigation described above as any potential loss is neither probable nor estimable at this stage of the investigation. 
  Although the Company believes that its reserves are adequate for environmental contingencies, it is possible due to the uncertainties noted above, that additional reserves could be required in the future that could have a material effect on the overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. This additional loss or range of losses cannot be recorded at this time, as it is not reasonably estimable. 
  Changes in total environmental liabilities are as follows: 

Environmental liabilities of   $23.6 million   and   $35.5 million   were classified as current in other accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The long-term portion of environmental liabilities is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Customs and International Trade Laws 
  In April 2012, the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) issued a civil investigative demand to the Company in connection with an investigation into the Company s compliance with applicable customs and international trade laws and regulations relating to the importation of saccharin from 2002 through 2012. The Company also became aware in 2010 of an investigation being conducted by US Customs and Border Patrol ( CBP ) into the Company s importation of saccharin. Finally, the Company learned that a civil plaintiff had sued the Company and   two   other defendants in a Qui Tam proceeding, such filing having been made under seal in 2012, and this plaintiff had requested that the DOJ intervene in its lawsuit. 
  The US government, through the DOJ, declined to intervene in the Qui Tam proceeding in November 2013 and, as a result, the DOJ s inquiry related to the Qui Tam lawsuit and its initial investigation demand are now finished. On February 26, 2014, the Qui Tam plaintiff also voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Company. 
  CBP, however, continued its investigation on the importation of saccharin by the Company s subsidiary, Univar USA Inc. On July 21, 2014, CBP sent the Company a  Pre-Penalty Notice  indicating the imposition of a penalty against Univar USA Inc. in the amount of approximately   $84.0 million  . Univar USA Inc. responded to CBP that the proposed penalty was not justified. On October 1, 2014, the CBP issued a penalty notice to Univar USA Inc. for   $84.0 million   and has reaffirmed this penalty notice. On August 6, 2015, the DOJ filed a complaint on CBP s behalf against Univar USA Inc. in the Court of International Trade seeking approximately   $84.0 million   in allegedly unpaid duties, penalties, interest, costs and attorneys  fees. Discovery is underway in this matter. The Company continues to defend this matter vigorously. Univar USA Inc. has not recorded a liability related to this investigation as the Company believes a loss is not probable. Although the Company believes its position is strong it cannot guarantee the outcome of this or other litigation.  

18.     Segments 
  Management monitors the operating results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Management evaluates performance on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income, plus the sum of: interest expense, net of interest income; income tax expense; depreciation; amortization; impairment charges; other operating expenses, net; and other income (expense), net. 
  Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms-length basis in a similar manner to transactions with third parties. Corporate operating expenses that directly benefit segments have been allocated to the operating segments. Allocable operating expenses are identified through a review process by management. These costs are allocated to the operating segments

     Table of Contents  

on a basis that reasonably approximates the use of services. This is typically measured on a weighted distribution of margin, asset, headcount or time spent. 
  Other/Eliminations represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions as well as unallocated corporate costs consisting of costs specifically related to parent company operations that do not directly benefit segments, either individually or collectively. 
    
  Financial information for the Company s segments is as follows:

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     Our operations are structured into four operating segments that represent the geographic areas under which we operate and manage our business. These segments are Univar USA ( USA ), Univar Canada ( Canada ), Univar Europe and the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ), and Rest of World ( Rest of World ), which includes developing businesses in Latin America (including Brazil and Mexico) and the Asia-Pacific region. 
  We monitor the results of our operating segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. We evaluate performance on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as our consolidated net income, plus the sum of interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, other operating expenses, net (which primarily consists of pension mark to market adjustments, acquisition and integration related expenses, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, advisory fees paid to stockholders, and other unusual or non-recurring expenses) and other (expense) income, net (which consists of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and undesignated derivative instruments, ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, debt refinancing costs, and other nonoperating activity). We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because: 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effects of income taxes, as well as the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization expenses; 
                
    we use Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets; 
                
    we consider gains (losses) on the acquisition, disposal and impairment of assets as resulting from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and 
                
    other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of our results. 
     We set transfer prices between operating segments on an arms-length basis in a similar manner to transactions with third parties. We allocate corporate operating expenses that directly benefit our operating segments on a basis that reasonably approximates our estimates of the use of these services. 
  Other/Eliminations represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions as well as unallocated corporate costs consisting of costs specifically related to parent company operations that do not directly benefit segments, either individually or collectively. In the analysis of our results of operations, we discuss operating segment results for the current reporting period following our consolidated results of operations period-to-period comparison. 
  The following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, set forth in this report under  Financial Statements  and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net sales were   $1,999.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $206.6 million  , or   9.4%  , from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in net sales from acquisitions was primarily driven by the November 2015 Weavertown and March 2016 Bodine acquisitions in the US and the October 2015 Future/BlueStar and March 2016 Nexus Ag acquisitions in Canada. The   decrease   in net sales from reported sales volumes primarily resulted from reductions in sales of upstream oil and gas products driven by reduced market demand. The   decrease   in net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was driven by all of our segments. Foreign currency translation remained flat when comparing the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   as the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound and Mexican peso was offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real.

Gross profit   decrease     $12.4 million  , or   2.8%  ,  to   $438.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in gross profit from acquisitions was primarily driven by the November 2015 Weavertown and March 2016 Bodine acquisitions in the US and the October 2015 Future/BlueStar acquisition in Canada. The   decrease   in gross profit from reported sales volumes primarily resulted from reductions in upstream oil and gas products driven by reduced market demand. The   decrease   in gross profit from changes in sales pricing, product costs and other adjustments was driven by the Rest of World, USA, and EMEA segments partially offset by   increases   in the Canada segment. Gross margin, which we define as gross profit divided by net sales,   increased   to   21.9%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   20.4%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Foreign currency translation   decreased   gross profit due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound and Mexican peso.

  Outbound freight and handling  
  Outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     $5.2 million  , or   6.4%  , to   $76.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation   decreased   outbound freight and handling expense by   0.1%   or   $0.1 million  . On a constant currency basis, outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     6.3%   or   $5.1 million  , which was primarily attributable to lower reported sales volumes. Refer to the  Segment results  for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   discussion for additional information.   
  Warehousing, selling and administrative 
  Warehousing, selling and administrative expenses   increased     $3.1 million  , or   1.5%  , to   $216.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Foreign currency translation   increased   warehousing, selling and administrative expenses by   $0.1 million  . On a constant currency basis, the   $3.0 million     increase   primarily related to $4.2 million of incremental expenses from acquisitions and $3.0 million of lower gains from the medical retiree benefit plan freeze as all gains from accumulated other comprehensive income have now been fully amortized.  Partially offsetting the increases was a $4.1 million reduction in personnel expenses primarily due to reduced variable compensation accruals.  The remaining $0.1 million decrease related to several insignificant components.

  Other operating expenses, net   increased     $1.9 million  , or   18.6%  , to   $12.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The   increase   was primarily related to a $3.0 million of higher consulting fees incurred to streamline operations and maximize operating performance, and $1.5 million of stock based compensation related to awards granted in 2016. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million of lower redundancy and restructuring charges in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a $1.7 million reduction in contingent consideration related to recent acquisitions, and a $1.2 million reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily driven by decreased integration activity on prior acquisitions. Refer to  Note 6: Redundancy and restructuring  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
  The remaining $2.9 million increase related to several insignificant components.  Foreign currency translation had no impact on other operating expenses.  Refer to  Note 5: Other operating expenses, net  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

Foreign currency translation   increased   depreciation expense by   2.9%   or   $1.0 million  .  On a constant currency basis, the   $7.1 million     increase   was primarily related to accelerated depreciation in connection with certain facility closures.  
  Amortization expense   increased     $0.5 million  , or   2.3%  , to   $22.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation had no impact on amortization expense. On a constant currency basis, the   increase   of   $0.5 million   was primarily driven by amortization of additional intangible assets related to our recent business acquisitions.   
  Impairment charges 
  Impairment charges   increased     $133.9 million  , or 100.0%, to   $133.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets. Refer to  Note 13: Impairment charge  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense   decreased     $0.2 million  , or   0.5%  , to   $40.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  Loss on extinguishment of debt   decreased     $4.8 million  , or   100.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The $4.8 million loss in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the July 2015 debt refinancing transactions.  
  Other expense, net 
  Other expense, net   decreased   by   $22.5 million   from   $25.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The change was primarily driven by expenses of $16.5 million incurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the July 2015 debt refinancing costs. Refer to  Note 7: Other expense, net  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
  Income tax (benefit) expense 
  Income tax (benefit) expense   decreased     $52.2 million   from an expense of   $7.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to a benefit of   $44.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in earnings resulting from an impairment charge, the release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax attributes, a decrease in losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit may not be recognized, and a decrease in the effect of flow-through entities partially offset by non-deductible interest expense and a decrease in non-taxable interest income.

External sales in the USA segment were   $1,222.1 million  , a   decrease   of   $142.5 million  , or   10.4%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in external net sales from acquisitions was primarily due to the November 2015 Weavertown and March 2016 Bodine acquisitions. The   decrease   in external net sales from reported sales volumes was primarily due to a reduction in sales of upstream oil and gas products driven by reduced market demand. The   decrease   in external net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from market driven deflationary pressures. Gross profit   decreased     $11.4 million  , or   4.1%  , to   $269.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in gross profit from acquisitions was primarily due to the November 2015 Weavertown and March 2016 Bodine acquisitions. Excluding the impact of volumes, gross profit decreased due to changes in sales pricing, product costs and other adjustments primarily due to market deflationary pressures resulting from sluggish industrial demand across several end markets. Gross margin   increased   from   20.6%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   22.0%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily driven by margin maintenance efforts while experiencing lower average selling prices..   
  Outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     $3.3 million  , or   5.9%  , to   $52.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to lower reported sales volumes and productivity improvements.  Operating expenses   increased     $5.2 million  , or   4.3%  , to   $126.9 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily driven by $3.2 million of incremental expenses from acquisitions, $3.0 million of a lower benefit from the retiree medical plan resulting from the gain related to freezing the medical retiree plan now being completely amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income, $1.1 million of incremental expenses from environmental  remediation, and $1.1 million of incremental pension expenses primarily due to a decrease in expected return on plan assets.  Partially offsetting the increase was a $4.9 million reduction in personnel expenses primarily due to reduced variable compensation expense.  The remaining $1.7 million increase related to several insignificant components.  Operating expenses as a percentage of external sales   increased   from   8.9%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   10.4%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Adjusted EBITDA   decreased   by   $13.3 million  , or   12.9%  , to   $90.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Acquisitions contributed $2.9 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Foreign currency translation   decreased   outbound freight and handling expense by   0.8%   or   $2.1 million  .  On a constant currency basis, outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     10.0%   or   $24.5 million  , which was primarily attributable to     lower reported sales volumes.  Refer to the  Segment results  for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   discussion for additional information.   
  Warehousing, selling and administrative 
  Warehousing, selling and administrative expenses   increased     $3.4 million  , or   0.5%  , to   $664.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Foreign currency translation decreased warehousing, selling and administrative expenses by   0.2%   or   $8.0 million  . The remaining   $11.4 million     increase   was primarily driven by $13.5 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions, $5.0 million of lower gains from the medical retiree benefit plan freeze as all gains from accumulated other comprehensive income have now been fully amortized, and $3.7 million of higher expenses associated with environmental remediation. Partially offsetting the increases were $3.0 million of lower variable compensation expense, primarily driven by lower Adjusted EBITDA and revisions to variable compensation arrangements, $2.4 million of lower contract labor expenses, and $2.7 million of lower travel   entertainment expenses, driven by efforts to control costs. The remaining $2.7 million decrease related to several insignificant components. Refer to the  Segment results  for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   discussion for additional information. 
  Other operating expenses, net 
  Other operating expenses, net   decreased     $28.2 million  , or   49.2%  , to   $29.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily related to a reduction of $26.2 million in advisory fees paid to our significant stockholders, CVC Capital Partners ( CVC ) and Clayton, Dubilier   Rice, LLC ( CD R ) resulting from the termination of the management contracts with CVC and CD R as part of our 2015 IPO.   
  Also contributing to the decrease was $12.3 million of lower redundancy and restructuring charges (primarily severance costs) in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015.  We estimate cost savings from redundancy and restructuring programs that have not been completed as of   September 30, 2016   to be approximately $30 to $40 million per year and we will be at that run rate of savings by the end of 2016.  Approximately 85 percent of the savings are within warehouse, selling and administrative expenses and 15 percent within cost of goods sold.  Just over half of these cost savings are being anticipated this year and are primarily within the USA and EMEA segments.  Cost savings from these programs will help offset other investments we make in our business and the impact of inflation. These estimated cost savings are based on information currently available to us.  There can be no guarantee that all or any of these cost savings will actually be achieved.  The actual

amount of costs savings, if any, may differ materially from the above estimates.  Refer to  Note 6: Redundancy and restructuring  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
  The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.0 million of additional consulting fees incurred to streamline operations and maximize operating performance. Acquisition and integration expenses increased $1.7 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily driven by increased integration activity on prior acquisitions. Stock based compensation increased $1.6 million primarily due to incremental expenses related to awards made in 2016. The remaining $4.0 million increase related to several insignificant components.  Foreign currency translation   decreased   other operating expenses, net by   6.8%   or   $3.9 million  .  Refer to  Note 5: Other operating expenses, net  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.   
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation expense   increased     $9.9 million  , or   9.5%  , to   $113.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation   decreased   depreciation expense by   0.3%   or   $0.3 million  .  On a constant currency basis, the   increase   of   $10.2 million  , or   9.8%  , primarily related accelerated deprecation for facility closures and the reassessment of useful lives of certain internally developed software in conjunction with reevaluating our overall information technology enhancement efforts.  
  Amortization expense   increased     $1.5 million  , or   2.3%  , to   $67.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Amortization expense   decreased     1.7%  , or   $1.1 million  , due to foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, the   increase   of   $2.6 million  , or   4.0%  , was primarily driven by additional intangible assets related to our recent business acquisitions.   
  Impairment charges 
  Impairment charges   increased     $133.9 million  , or 100.0%, to   $133.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets.  Refer to  Note 13: Impairment charge  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense   decreased     $46.3 million  , or   27.3%  , to   $123.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the June 2015 and July 2015 debt refinancing activity. Foreign currency translation   decreased   interest expense by   0.5%   or   $0.9 million  .  
  Loss on extinguishment of debt 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt   decreased     $12.1 million  , or   100.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The $12.1 million loss in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount related to the payment of the principal balance for our then outstanding senior subordinated notes during June 2015.  
  Other expense, net 
  Other expense, net   decreased     $20.1 million  , or   65.0%  , to   $10.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily driven by debt refinancing costs of $16.5 million and the discontinuance of cash flow hedges of $7.5 million that occurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Refer to  Note 11: Debt  and  Note 15: Derivatives  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information, respectively.  
  The decrease was partially offset by foreign currency denominated loan revaluation losses of $13.7 million primarily resulting from the revaluation of the Euro Tranche Term Loan in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to gains of $1.8 million in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The remaining $11.6 million decrease was related to several insignificant components. Refer to  Note 7: Other (expense) income, net  in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
  Income tax (benefit) expense  
  Income tax (benefit) expense   decreased     $53.2 million   from an expense of   $14.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to a benefit of   $38.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in earnings resulting from an impairment charge, the release of a valuation allowance on certain foreign tax attributes, a decrease in losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit may not be recognized, and a decrease in the effect of flow-through entities partially offset by non-deductible interest expense and a decrease in non-taxable interest income.

External sales in the USA segment were   $3,622.4 million  , a   decrease   of   $526.4 million  , or   12.7%  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in external net sales from acquisitions was primarily due to the November 2015 Weavertown, July 2015 Chemical Associates, and March 2016 Bodine acquisitions. The   decrease   in external net sales from reported sales volumes was primarily due to a reduction in sales of upstream oil and gas products driven by reduced market demand. The   decrease   in external net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from market driven deflationary pressures. Gross profit   decreased     $51.4 million  , or   6.1%  , to   $795.3 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in gross profit from acquisitions was primarily due to the November 2015 Weavertown, March 2016 Bodine, and July 2015 Chemical Associates acquisitions. Gross profit   decreased   due to changes in sales pricing, product costs and other adjustments primarily due to market deflationary pressures resulting from sluggish industrial demand across several end markets. Gross margin   increased   from   20.4%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   22.0%   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to product mix.

plan freeze as all gains from accumulated other comprehensive income have now been fully amortized, $3.5 million of incremental bad debt expense, $3.3 million of incremental pension expenses primarily driven by lower expected return on assets, and $3.1 million of higher environmental remediation expense.  The increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $5.2 million of lower variable compensation expense driven by lower Adjusted EBITDA as well as revisions to variable compensation arrangements and $3.7 million of lower consulting fees and contract labor expenses driven by tighter cost management.  The remaining $0.8 million increase related to several insignificant components. Operating expenses as a percentage of external sales   increased   from   9.1%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   10.8%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

External sales in the Canada segment were   $1,018.9 million  , a   decrease   of   $99.6 million  , or   8.9%  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation   decreased   external sales dollars as the US dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar when comparing the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . On a constant currency basis, external sales dollars   decreased     $49.5 million   or   4.4%  . The   increase   in external net sales from acquisitions was due to the October 2015 Future/BlueStar and March 2016 Nexus Ag acquisitions. The   decrease   in external net sales from reported sales volumes was primarily due to lower sales in the oil and gas end market within Western Canada. The   decrease   in external net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was primarily driven by lower average selling prices. Gross profit   decreased     $2.4 million  , or   1.4%  , to   $166.8 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in gross profit from acquisitions was due to the October 2015 Future/BlueStar and March 2016 Nexus Ag acquisitions. Gross profit   increased   due to changes in sales pricing, product costs and other adjustments primarily due to increased gross margins across several end markets as well as a shift in product mix towards higher margin products and services during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Gross margin   increased   from   15.1%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   16.4%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   
  Outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     $4.6 million  , or   15.4%  , to   $25.2 million   primarily due to lower reported sales volumes, cost efficiencies and foreign currency translation.  Operating expenses   decreased   by   $2.5 million  , or   3.9%  , to   $62.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   increased   as a percentage of external sales from   5.8%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   6.1%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased operating expenses by 4.8% or $3.1 million. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses increased $0.6 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to increased personnel expenses of $4.7 million driven by annual compensation increases and $2.7 million of incremental expenses from acquisitions.  The increase in operating expense was partially offset by lower pension expense of $3.3 million resulting from the soft freeze of the Canadian pension plan. The remaining $3.5 million decrease related to several insignificant components. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   increased   by   $4.7 million  , or   6.3%  , to   $79.2 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased Adjusted EBITDA by 5.2% or $3.9 million. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $8.6 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to decreased cost of sales generating increased gross profit and decreased outbound freight and handling expenses. Acquisitions contributed $3.0 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Adjusted EBITDA margin   increased   from   6.7%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   7.8%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of improved gross margin and lower outbound freight and handling expenses.

External sales in the EMEA segment were   $1,309.8 million  , a   decrease   of   67.2 million  , or   4.9%  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in external net sales from acquisitions was due to the December 2015 acquisition of Polymer Technology Limited. The   decrease   in external net sales from reported sales volumes was primarily due to the continuing impacts of our previously implemented restructuring programs partially offset by increases due to no longer experiencing the tight market conditions related to caustic soda which existed in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in external net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was primarily driven by lower pricing on products linked to oil prices. Foreign currency translation   decreased   external sales dollars primarily resulting from the US dollar strengthening against the British pound, partially offset by the US dollar weakening against the euro, when comparing the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Gross profit   decreased     $0.9 million  , or   0.3%  , to   $292.1 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Gross profit   increased   due to changes in sales pricing, product costs and other adjustments primarily due to increased sales of higher margin pharmaceutical finished goods as well as the continued impacts of our product mix enrichment strategy. Gross margin   increased   from   21.3%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   22.3%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the factors impacting gross profit discussed above.  
  Outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     $3.8 million  , or   8.3%  , to   $41.9 million   primarily due to lower reported sales volumes and reduced common carrier costs.  Operating expenses   decreased     $11.3 million  , or   6.6%  , to   $160.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   decreased   as a percentage of external sales from   12.5%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   12.2%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased operating expenses by 0.1% or $0.1 million. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 6.5%, which was primarily related to lower personnel expenses of $2.6 million primarily driven by lower variable compensation expense, lower bad debt expenses of $1.1 million driven by receiving payments on previously reserved aged receivables, and lower lease expense of $0.9 million due to certain operating leases being replaced by capital leases. The remaining $6.6 million decrease related to several insignificant components. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   increased   by   $14.2 million  , or   18.8%  , to   $89.8 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased Adjusted EBITDA by 3.3% or $2.5     million. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $16.7 million, or 22.1%, primarily due to sales of pharmaceutical finished goods contributing approximately 68% of the increase as well as continuing to benefit from reductions in operating expenses resulting from our previous restructuring activities. Sales of pharmaceutical finished goods represent approximately 25% of Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin   increased   from   5.5%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   6.9%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of reductions in operating expenses and decreased outbound freight and handling expenses.

position in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   against the   Mexican peso, partially offset by the US dollar weakening against the Brazilian real.   The   decrease   in external net sales from reported sales volumes was primarily due to decreases in the Asia Pacific region partially offset by increases in Mexico and Brazil resulting from market penetration.  The   increase   in external net sales from changes in sales pricing and product mix was primarily   due to changes in product mix. Gross profit   decreased     $10.8 million  , or   15.3%  , to   $59.6 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   Gross profit   increased   due to a shift in product mix towards higher margin products and services. Gross margin   increased   from   19.0%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   19.2%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to the factors impacting gross profit discussed above.  
  Outbound freight and handling expenses   decreased     $1.3 million  , or   19.1%  , to   $5.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased outbound freight and handling expenses by 11.8% or $0.8 million. On a constant currency basis, outbound freight and handling expenses decreased $0.5 million or 7.4%, which was primarily due to lower volumes as well as synergies resulting from the consolidation of warehouses from the D Altomare acquisition. Operating expenses   decreased     $4.4 million  , or   11.1%  , to   $35.1 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   increased   as a percentage of external sales from   10.6%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   11.3%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased operating expenses by 12.2% or $4.8 million. On constant currency basis, operating expenses increased $0.4 million, or 1.0%, which related to several insignificant components. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   decreased   by   $5.1 million  , or   21.2%  , to   $19.0 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation decreased Adjusted EBITDA by 12.4% or $3.0 million. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.1 million, or 8.7%, primarily due to decreased gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin   decreased   from   6.5%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   6.1%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations as well as borrowings under our credit facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $537.9 million available under our credit facilities. 
  We are in compliance with all of our covenant ratios and believe there is adequate margin between the covenant ratios and the actual ratios given the current trends of the business. 
  Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to service our debt and to finance working capital, capital expenditures, other liabilities and cost of acquisitions. We believe that funds provided by these sources will be adequate to meet the liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. We will continue to balance our focus on sales and earnings growth with continuing efforts in cost control and working capital management. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below: 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash   provided   by operating activities   increased     $33.0 million   from   $191.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $224.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a   $56.4 million   increase in net income exclusive of non-cash items in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Refer to  Results of Operations  above for additional information. 
  The increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a   $29.0 million   increase from changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets which primarily consisted of a $24.6 million increase from the change in income tax receivable.  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Another factor contributing to the increase in cash flow from operations was a   $19.5 million   reduction in contributions made to pensions and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The above increases were partially offset by a   $31.9 million   decrease in trade working capital, which includes trade accounts receivables, net, inventories and trade accounts payable. The reduction in cash flows from changes in trade working capital is largely attributable to increases in trade receivables during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily driven by a more typical trend of increasing sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to more deflationary sales trends during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Also contributing to the decrease offsetting the increase in cash provided by operating activities is a   $40.0 million   decrease in other, net, which is primarily attributable to reductions in other accrued expenses primarily driven by reductions in customer deposits within our Canadian agricultural business driven by the strong agricultural season and increases in other assets. 
  Cash Used by Investing Activities 
  Cash   used   by investing activities   decreased     $34.9 million   from   $153.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $118.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The decrease is primarily related to lower spending on capital expenditures of   $37.4 million  . The reduction was driven by higher capital expenditures during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   resulting from several significant facility expansion projects as well as software support efficiency projects that were completed within the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The decrease in cash used by investing activities was partially offset by increased cash outflows for purchases of businesses, net of cash acquired of   $4.2 million   primarily driven by the March 2016 acquisitions of Bodine and Nexus AG, which was partially offset by the July 2015 Chemical Associates, Inc. and April 2015 Key Chemical, Inc acquisitions. 
  The remaining decrease in cash used by investing activities of $1.7 million did not contain any significant activity. 
  Cash Used by Financing Activities 
  Cash   used   by financing activities   increased   $  32.4 million   from $  14.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to $  46.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the prior year closing of our IPO and a concurrent private placement of our equity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The proceeds, net of fees, related to the IPO and concurrent private placement of our equity were $763.6 million.  Also contributing to the increase in cash used by financing activities are long-term debt payments; inclusive of the Term B Loan, NA ABL Facility, Euro Tranche Term Loan, and capital lease obligation; of $40.6 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The increase in cash used by financing activities was partially offset by the June and July 2015 debt refinancing activities that reduced the outstanding debt by $731.3 million during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Financing fees paid decreased by $28.7 million due to the July 2015 debt refinancing activity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Short-term financing, net decreased by $4.9 million due to higher payments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   when compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The remaining decrease in cash used by financing activities of $6.9 million did not contain any significant activity.
