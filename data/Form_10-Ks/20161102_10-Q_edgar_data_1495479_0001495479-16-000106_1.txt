1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Description of Business     As of   September 25, 2016  , Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. (the  Company ) operated   116   restaurants under the trade names  Bravo! Cucina Italiana       ,   Brio Tuscan Grille       ,  and  Bon Vie       .  Of the   116   restaurants the Company operates, there are   51   Bravo! Cucina Italiana        restaurants,   64   Brio Tuscan Grille        restaurants and   one   Bon Vie        restaurant in operation in   33   states throughout the United States of America. The Company owns all of its restaurants with the exception of   one   Brio Tuscan Grille        restaurant, which it operates under a management agreement and for which operation it receives a management fee. Additionally,   one   Brio Tuscan Grille        restaurant is operated under a franchise agreement. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The operating results included herein are not necessarily indicative of results for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates.  
  Certain information and disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and related condensed notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015   filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016   (the    2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K ). 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This ASU provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, this guidance expands related disclosure requirements. The pronouncement is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements as well as the expected adoption method. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30)  . This ASU requires an entity to present term debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related term debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this ASU during the thirteen weeks ended March 27, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)  . This ASU provides guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, which changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value.  This update defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740)  . This ASU requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This ASU simplifies the current standard, which requires entities to separately present deferred  
  
   -    7   - 

     Table of Contents  

tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities and the Company elected to apply this ASU during the thirteen weeks ended March 27, 2016 on a retrospective basis.  Accordingly, the Company classified all deferred income taxes as noncurrent as of   September 25, 2016   and reclassified   $3.6 million   of current deferred income taxes to noncurrent deferred income taxes as of December 27, 2015.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . This ASU requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and also disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company has not adopted this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  . This ASU is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company has not adopted this ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.

    NET INCOME PER SHARE 
     Basic earnings per share (EPS) data is computed based on weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS data is computed based on weighted average common shares outstanding, including all potentially issuable common shares.   
  (in thousands, except per share data) 

Shares of common stock equivalents of   806,286   were excluded from the diluted calculation for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended   September 25, 2016   due to a net loss during each respective period. Shares of common stock equivalents of   18,000   and   29,250   were excluded from the diluted calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .

3. 
    LONG-TERM DEBT 
     On November 5, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the "2014 Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of financial institutions. The 2014 Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to   $100.0 million   (including a sublimit cap of up to   $10.0 million   for letters of credit and up to   $10.0 million   for swing-line loans), maturing in November   2019  .  
  Under the 2014 Credit Agreement, the Company may increase the revolving credit facility by up to   $25.0 million   if no event of default exists and certain other requirements are satisfied. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the Company s option of either (i) the Base Rate (as such term is defined in the 2014 Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin of   0.50%   to   1.50%   or (ii) at a fixed rate for a period of one, two, three or six months equal to the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of   1.50%   to   2.50%  . In addition, the Company is required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders equal to   0.20%   to   0.35%   per annum on the aggregate amount of the unused revolving credit facility, excluding swing-line loans, commencing on November 5, 2014, payable quarterly in arrears. Borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of the Company and its subsidiaries.  As of   September 25, 2016  , we had an outstanding balance of   $51.0 million   on our revolving credit facility. 
  The 2014 Credit Agreement provides for bank guarantees under standby letter of credit arrangements in the normal course of business operations. The standby letters of credit are cancellable only at the option of the beneficiary who is authorized to draw drafts on the issuing bank up to the face amount of the standby letters of credit in accordance with its credit. As of   September 25, 2016  , the maximum exposure under these standby letters of credit was   $2.9 million  . 
  During the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , the Company determined that it may not be in compliance with one of the 2014 Credit Agreement's financial covenants that is measured and reported on a quarterly basis at the end of the quarter. On September 23, 2016, the Company received a waiver of noncompliance with this financial covenant that is effective until October 31, 2016. 
  As more fully described in Note 8, on October 31, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2014 Credit Agreement (the "Amendment"). The Amendment redefines the Company's senior credit facilities and provides for (i) a   $35.0 million   term loan facility, maturing in 2019, and (ii) a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to   $30.0 million   (including a sublimit cap of up to   $10.0 million   for letters of credit and up to   $10.0 million   for swing-line loans), maturing in 2019. In addition, the Amendment requires the Company to make fixed quarterly principal payments of   $1.0 million   under the senior credit facilities.  As a result of this requirement, the Company has classified   $4.0 million   of its long-term debt as current in its consolidated balance sheets as of September 25, 2016. 

4. 
    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
     In June 2006, the Company adopted the Bravo Development, Inc. Option Plan (the  2006 Plan ) in order to provide an incentive to employees. In conjunction with the Company s initial public offering, all of the then outstanding options under the 2006 Plan became exercisable and the 2006 Plan was terminated. No further compensation costs will be recorded under the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan was replaced with the Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the  Stock Incentive Plan ), which was adopted in October 2010. 
    
  2006 Plan 
  Stock option activity for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   is summarized as follows: 

At   September 25, 2016  , the weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding was approximately   0.6 years   and all of the options were exercisable. Aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the  
  
   -    9   - 

     Table of Contents  

Company s closing price at the end of the fiscal quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options and represents the pre-tax amount that would have been received by the option holders had they all exercised such options on the fiscal quarter end date. The aggregate intrinsic value for outstanding and exercisable options at   September 25, 2016   was   $1.5 million  . The Company's stock option award agreements allow employees to surrender to the Company common shares upon exercise in lieu of their payment of the exercise price and required personal employment-related taxes. Employees surrendered to the Company   3,304   common shares towards the exercise price and minimum statutory tax withholdings which the Company recorded as a reduction in common shares in an amount of approximately   $15.9 thousand   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016  .  There were no such common shares withheld during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . 
  Stock Incentive Plan 
  Restricted stock activity for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   is summarized as follows: 

Fair value of the outstanding shares of restricted stock is based on the average of the high and low price of the Company s shares on the date immediately preceding the date of grant.  Stock compensation costs related to shares of restricted stock were approximately   $0.9 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 25, 2016  , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested shares of restricted stock was approximately   $2.3 million   taking into account potential forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.9 years  . These shares of restricted stock will vest, subject to certain exceptions, annually over a   four  -year period.  The Company's restricted stock award agreements allow employees to surrender to the Company shares of stock upon vesting in lieu of their payment of the required personal employment-related taxes. Employees surrendered to the Company   22,792   and   30,417   shares of restricted stock towards the minimum statutory tax withholdings, which the Company recorded as a reduction in common shares in the amount of approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 

5. 
    INCOME TAXES 
     The Company s consolidated balance sheets at   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015   included net deferred income tax assets of   $59.6 million   and   $58.1 million  , respectively. The Company performs a periodic analysis to evaluate whether the deferred income tax assets will be realized. As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. 
  In 2012, the Company was audited by the Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2010.  On August 25, 2016, the Company executed an agreement to settle this audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 

6  .     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company is subject to various claims, possible legal actions, and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these issues, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for potential losses has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

7.     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
  The Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  The Company has determined that its asset group for impairment testing is comprised of the assets and liabilities of each of its individual restaurants, as this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows and primarily includes an assessment of historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances. As part of the review, the Company also takes into account that its business is highly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations such as the holiday season at the end of the fourth quarter as it significantly impacts its short and long term projections for each location. The other factors and circumstances include changes in the economic environment, changes in the manner in which assets are used, unfavorable changes in legal factors or business climate, incurring excess costs in construction of the asset, overall restaurant operating performance and projections for future performance. These estimates result in a wide range of variability on a year to year basis due to the nature of the criteria.  
    
  The Company evaluates future undiscounted cash flow projections in conjunction with qualitative factors and future operating plans. The impairment assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and operating outcomes, which are based upon a significant degree of management s judgment.  The estimates used in the impairment analysis represent a Level 3 fair value measurement. At any given time, the Company may be monitoring a small number of locations, and future impairment charges could be required if individual restaurant performance does not improve.  The Company forecasts future cash flows by considering recent restaurant level performance, restaurant level operating plans, sales trends, and cost trends for cost of sales, labor and operating expenses. The Company compares this cash flow forecast to the asset's carrying value at the restaurant. Based on this analysis, if the Company determines that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized based upon the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds fair value. The Company incurred a non-cash impairment charge of   $1.2 million   during the thirty-nine weeks ended   September 25, 2016   related to one restaurant. The Company did not recognize an impairment charge during the thirty-nine weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . 

8.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 31, 2016, the Company entered into the Amendment. The Amendment redefines the Company's senior credit facilities and provides for (i) a   $35.0 million   term loan facility, maturing in 2019, and (ii) a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to   $30.0 million   (including a sublimit cap of up to   $10.0 million   for letters of credit and up to   $10.0 million   for swing-line loans), maturing in 2019. Additionally, the Company is no longer allowed to increase the revolving credit facility by up to   $25.0 million  .  
  Borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a fixed rate for a period of one, two, three or six months equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin of   2.50%   to   3.00%  .  In addition to making fixed quarterly principal payments under the Company s senior credit facilities, the Company is required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders equal to   0.30%   to   0.50%   per annum on the aggregate amount of the unused revolving credit facility, excluding swing-line loans, commencing on October 31, 2016, payable quarterly in arrears. The Amendment also modifies the financial tests that the Company is required to meet by removing the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, revising the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, adding a maximum consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio and adding a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by the Amendment.  In addition to these financial tests, the Amendment places limitations on new restaurant leases until the lease-adjusted leverage ratio meets certain thresholds. The Amendment also provides the Company with a permanent waiver of noncompliance with certain financial tests under the 2014 Credit Agreement for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016.

  Overview 
  We are a leading owner and operator of two distinct Italian restaurant brands, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana ( BRAVO! ) and BRIO Tuscan Grille ( BRIO ), which for purposes of the following discussion includes our one Bon Vie restaurant. We have positioned our brands as multifaceted culinary destinations that deliver the ambiance, design elements and food quality reminiscent of fine dining restaurants at a value typically offered by casual dining establishments, a combination known as the upscale affordable dining segment. Each of our brands provides its guests with a fine dining experience and value by serving affordable cuisine prepared using fresh flavorful ingredients and authentic Italian cooking methods, combined with attentive service in an attractive, lively atmosphere. We strive to be the best Italian restaurant company in America and are focused on providing our guests an excellent dining experience through consistency of execution. 
    
  Our approach to operations continues to focus on core ways to drive and grow our business.  We look for new and different ways to increase our comparable restaurant sales through various initiatives.  We are constantly identifying new potential sites to expand both of our brands by opening new restaurants in the best possible locations within a development and throughout the country.  We will continue to evaluate our existing restaurant base to ensure each location is meeting our standards from both an operational and profitability standpoint.  Finally, we explore all of our options in deploying our capital in a way that is best for our shareholders and our business. 
  Our business is highly sensitive to seasonal fluctuations as historically the percentage of operating income earned during the fourth quarter has been higher due in part to higher restaurant sales during the year-end holiday shopping season.  Our business is also highly sensitive to changes in guest traffic and the operating environment continues to be difficult with negative comparable restaurant sales, driven by decreased guest traffic, in each quarter of 2014 and 2015 as well as the first three quarters of 2016. Increases and decreases in guest traffic can have a significant impact on our financial results. In recent years, we have faced uncertain economic conditions, which have resulted in changes to our guests  discretionary spending. To adjust for this decrease in guest spending, we have focused on controlling product margins and costs while maintaining our high standards for food quality and service and enhancing our guests  dining experience. We have worked with our distributors and suppliers to control commodity costs, become more efficient with the use of our employee base and found new ways to improve efficiencies across our company. We have increased our electronic advertising, social media communication and public relations activities as well as implemented an on-line reservation system in order to bring new guests to our restaurants and keep loyal guests coming back to grow our revenues. We have focused resources on the release of a new menu at each brand during the current period as part of our efforts to drive higher sales volumes at our restaurants.  
  Recent guest traffic trends and their effect on sales may result in individual restaurants being cash flow negative.  For these restaurants, the Company reviews the associated long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, for impairment. We are currently monitoring the performance of certain restaurants with negative cash flows.  Based on our current projections, no impairment, beyond what has already been recorded, has been identified. However, depending upon the performance trends of these restaurants in the fourth quarter, an impairment charge may be necessary.

  Results of Operations 
  Thirteen Weeks Ended   September 25, 2016   Compared to the Thirteen Weeks Ended   September 27, 2015    
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our consolidated statements of operations both on an actual basis and expressed as a percentage of revenues. 

Revenues.   Revenues   decreased     $3.7 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $94.6 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , as compared to   $98.3 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $3.7 million   was primarily due to a   decrease   of   5.3%  , or $5.0 million in comparable restaurant sales, which was the result of a   5.4%     decrease   in guest counts and a 0.1% increase in average check. Partially offsetting the effect of this   decrease   in comparable restaurant sales was a net additional 20 operating weeks provided by one restaurant opened in the fourth quarter of   2015   and two restaurants opened in the first three quarters of   2016  , less the impact of a restaurant closure in the fourth quarter of 2015 and two restaurant closures in the third quarter of 2016. We consider a restaurant to be part of the comparable restaurant base in the first full quarter following the eighteenth month of operations.  
  For our BRAVO! brand, restaurant revenues   decreased     $3.1 million  , or   8.1%  , to   $34.9 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $38.0 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . Comparable restaurant sales for the BRAVO! brand restaurants   decrease  d   8.0%  , or   $2.7 million  , to   $31.7 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $34.4 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015   due to a   decrease   in both guest counts and average check. Revenues for BRAVO! brand restaurants not included in the comparable restaurant base   decrease  d $0.4 million to $3.2 million for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to $3.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .  The   decrease   of $0.4 million was primarily due to the impact of a restaurant closure in the fourth quarter of 2015 and two restaurant closures in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by the opening of two BRAVO! restaurants in the first quarter of 2016.  At   September 25, 2016  , there were   46   BRAVO! restaurants included in the comparable restaurant base and   five   BRAVO! restaurants not included in the comparable restaurant base. 
  For our BRIO brand, restaurant revenues   decrease  d   $0.8 million  , or   1.3%  , to   $58.8 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $59.6 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . Comparable restaurant sales for the BRIO brand restaurants   decrease  d   3.7%  , or   $2.2 million  , to   $56.5 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $58.7 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , due to a decrease in guest counts, partially offset by an increase in average check.

The   increase   of $1.4 million was primarily due to the opening of one BRIO restaurant in the fourth quarter of 2015.  At   September 25, 2016  , there were   61   BRIO restaurants included in the comparable restaurant base and   three   BRIO restaurants not included in the comparable restaurant base. 
    
  Cost of Sales.   Cost of sales   increased     $0.8 million  , or   3.3%  , to   $25.3 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $24.5 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .

This increase was primarily due to the impact of a net additional   20   operating weeks in   2016   as compared to   2015  .  As a percentage of revenues, labor costs   increased   to   39.1%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , from   36.9%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , primarily due to additional costs associated with the implementation of a new menu at both brands as well as the deleveraging resulting from the   decrease   in comparable restaurant sales during the quarter.  
  Operating Costs.   Operating costs   decreased     $0.5 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $16.4 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $16.9 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .

As a percentage of revenues, operating costs increased to   17.4%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , from   17.2%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , primarily due to the deleveraging resulting from the   decrease   in comparable restaurant sales during the quarter. 
  Occupancy Costs.   Occupancy costs   increased     $0.1 million  , or   1.6%  , to   $8.0 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to   $7.9 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .  This increase was primarily due to the impact of a net additional   20   operating weeks in   2016   as compared to   2015  .  As a percentage of revenues, occupancy costs   increased   to   8.5%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , from   8.1%   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . 
  General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $1.5 million  , or   27.7%  , to   $6.9 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , as compared to   $5.4 million   for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .

Year over year changes in pre-opening costs are driven by the timing and number of restaurant openings in a given period. During the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , we did not open any restaurants and had one   restaurant   under construction. During the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , we opened one restaurant and had three   restaurants   under construction.

ended   September 25, 2016   as compared to approximately 19% for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , partially offset by the excess tax deficiency from share based payments. The difference in the estimated annual effective tax rate was the result of the relative impact of general business credits on an expected annual loss before income taxes for the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively.  
  Non-GAAP Measures.   Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered by themselves or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  We calculate these non-GAAP measures by adjusting net income and net income per share for the impact of certain non-comparable items that are reflected in our GAAP results. We believe these adjusted measures provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results and assist users of the financial statements to better understand our results. We utilize results that both include and exclude the identified items in evaluating our business performance. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will not be affected by certain unusual or non-comparable items.  
  The following is a reconciliation from net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share to the corresponding adjusted measures (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

              2) 
    Diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes potentially issuable common shares, except in a loss position, in which case diluted weighted average shares outstanding is equal to basic weighted average shares outstanding. Shares of common stock equivalents of   18,000   were excluded from the diluted calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect for the thirteen weeks ended   September 27, 2015  .

The decrease of   $8.1 million   was primarily due to a decrease in comparable restaurant sales of   5.1%  , or $15.0 million, which was the result of a   4.7%   decrease in guest counts and a 0.4% decrease in average check. Partially offsetting the effect of this decrease in comparable restaurant sales was a net additional   142   operating weeks provided by six restaurants opened in   2015   and   two   restaurants opened in the first three quarters of   2016  , less the impact of a restaurant closure in the fourth quarter of 2015 and two restaurant closures in 2016.

As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses   increased   to   6.5%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to   5.4%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  , due mainly to an increase in professional fees and marketing costs as well as the deleveraging resulting from the   decrease   in comparable restaurant sales in the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  Restaurant Pre-opening Costs.   Pre-opening costs   decreased   by   $1.8 million   to   $0.6 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to   $2.4 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . Year over year changes in pre-opening costs are driven by the timing and number of restaurant openings in a given period. During the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016  , we opened   two     restaurants   and had   one   restaurant under construction. In the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2015  , we opened   five     restaurants   and had   three   additional   restaurants   under construction. 
  Impairment.    We review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of assets, changes in our overall business strategy and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment charges have been incurred as a result of locations that have had lower than anticipated traffic near the restaurant and locations that have opened in areas with lower than normal retail co-tenancy. Based upon our analysis, we

     Table of Contents  

incurred a non-cash impairment charge of   $1.2 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   related to one restaurant. We did not incur a non-cash impairment charge during the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  .  
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expenses   increased     $0.2 million   to   $16.7 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to   $16.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses   increase  d to   5.4%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to   5.2%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . The   increase  , as a percentage of revenues, was due to the deleveraging resulting from the   decrease   in comparable restaurant sales during the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016  . 
  Net Interest Expense.   Net interest expense remained flat at   $1.1 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   and the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  .  
  Income Taxes.   Income tax benefit increased $3.0 million to   $1.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to an income tax expense of   $1.5 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . The increase in income tax benefit was due to lower income before taxes, which was primarily driven by an impairment charge in the period and the adjustment of the estimated annual effective tax rate to approximately 90% for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   as compared to approximately 19% for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  , partially offset by the excess tax deficiency from share based payments. The difference in the estimated annual effective tax rate was the result of the relative impact of general business credits on an expected annual loss before income taxes for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively.  
  Non-GAAP Measures.   Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered by themselves or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  We calculate these non-GAAP measures by adjusting net income and net income per share for the impact of certain non-comparable items that are reflected in our GAAP results. We believe these adjusted measures provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results and assist users of the financial statements to better understand our results. We utilize results that both include and exclude the identified items in evaluating our business performance. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will not be affected by certain unusual or non-comparable items.  
  The following is a reconciliation from net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share to the corresponding adjusted measures (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Liquidity 
  Our principal sources of cash have been net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of   September 25, 2016  , we had approximately   $0.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents. On October 31, 2016, the Company entered into the Amendment. The Amendment redefines the Company's senior credit facilities and provides for (i) a $35.0 million term loan facility, maturing in 2019, and (ii) a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $30.0 million (including a sublimit cap of up to $10.0 million for letters of credit and up to $10.0 million for swing-line loans), maturing in 2019. After giving effect to the Amendment, as of September 25, 2016 we would have had approximately $11.1 million of availability under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $2.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, $16.0 million in outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility and the conversion of $35.0 million of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility into the new term loan facility).  
  Our need for capital resources is driven by our restaurant expansion plans, on-going maintenance of our restaurants and investment in our corporate and information technology infrastructures. Based on our current real estate development plans, we believe our combined expected cash flows from operations, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and expected landlord lease incentives will be sufficient to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities over the next twelve months. 
  Consistent with many other restaurant and retail chain store operations, we use operating lease arrangements for the majority of our restaurant locations. We believe that these operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. Currently, operating lease obligations are not reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet. The use of operating lease arrangements may impact our capacity to borrow money under our revolving credit facility. However, restaurant real estate operating leases are expressly excluded from the restrictions under our revolving credit facility related to the incurrence of funded indebtedness. 
  Our liquidity may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including a decrease in guest traffic or average check per guest due to changes in economic conditions, as described in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading  Risk Factors.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Operating Activities.   Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $7.1 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 25, 2016  , compared to   $24.6 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended     September 27, 2015  . The   decrease   in net cash   provided by   operating activities in the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016   was primarily due to lower cash receipts from operations and lease incentives during the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 25, 2016   compared to the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . Cash receipts from operations for the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016   and   2015   were, including the net redemption of gift cards,   $306.1 million   and   $313.2 million  , respectively. Cash expenditures for operations during the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016   and   2015   were   $299.2 million   and   $295.1 million  , respectively. 
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities was   $11.6 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to   $19.8 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . We invest cash to purchase property and equipment related to our restaurant expansion plans, which is related to the timing of spending for our new restaurants as well as the number of restaurants that were opened and under construction during   2016   versus   2015  . During the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2016  , we opened   two   restaurants and had one additional   restaurant   under construction. During the first   thirty-nine   weeks of   2015  , we opened five restaurants and had three additional   restaurants   under construction. 
  Financing Activities.   Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $4.5 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , compared to net cash   used in   financing activities of   $4.8 million   for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 27, 2015  . For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , the Company had net borrowings of   $7.7 million   on its revolving credit facility and repurchased   $3.5 million   in treasury stock. For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   September 27, 2015  , the Company had net repayments of $4.5 million on its revolving credit facility. 
  As of   September 25, 2016  , we had no financing transactions, arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties. Additionally, we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts. 
   
  Capital Resources 
  Future Capital Requirements.   Our capital requirements are primarily dependent upon the pace of our real estate development program and resulting new restaurants. Our real estate development program is dependent upon many factors, including economic conditions, real estate markets, site locations and the nature of lease agreements. Our capital expenditure outlays are also dependent on costs for maintenance and capacity additions in our existing restaurants as well as information technology and other general corporate capital expenditures. 
  We anticipate that each new restaurant on average will require a total cash investment of $1.5 million to $2.5 million (net of estimated lease incentives). We expect to spend approximately $0.4 million to $0.5 million per restaurant for cash pre-opening costs. The projected cash investment per restaurant is based on historical averages. 
  We currently estimate capital expenditures, net of estimated lease incentives, for the remainder of   2016   to be in the range of approximately   $1.8 million   to   $3.8 million  , for a total of   $12.0 million   to   $14.0 million   for the year   2016  .  This is primarily related to the opening of one additional restaurant in the last   quarter   of   2016  , the start of construction of restaurants to be opened in   2017  , as well as normal maintenance related capital expenditures relating to our existing restaurants. In conjunction with these restaurant openings, the Company anticipates expensing approximately $0.4 million to   $0.9 million   in pre-opening costs for the remainder of   2016   for a total of approximately $1.0 million to   $1.5 million   for the year   2016  . 
  Current Resources.   Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate with negative working capital. Restaurant sales are primarily paid for in cash or by credit card, and  
  
   -    20   - 

     Table of Contents  

restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies, therefore reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. We had a net working capital   deficit   of   $49.5 million   at   September 25, 2016  , compared to a net working capital   deficit   of   $51.7 million   at   December 27, 2015  . 
  On November 5, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The 2014 Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $100.0 million (including a sublimit cap of up to $10.0 million for letters of credit and up to $10.0 million for swing-line loans), maturing in November 2019.  Under the 2014 Credit Agreement, the Company may increase the revolving credit facility by up to $25.0 million if no event of default exists and certain other requirements are satisfied.  Our revolving credit facility is (i) jointly and severally guaranteed by each of our existing or subsequently acquired or formed subsidiaries, (ii) secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our subsidiaries  tangible and intangible personal property and (iii) secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The 2014 Credit Agreement also requires the Company to meet financial tests, including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. Additionally, the 2014 Credit Agreement contains negative covenants limiting, among other things, additional indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, additional liens, sales of assets, dividends, investments and advances, prepayments of debt, mergers and acquisitions, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements and customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, defaults under other material debt, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the revolving credit facility to be in full force and effect, and a change of control of our business.  
  During the thirteen weeks ended   September 25, 2016  , the Company determined that it may not be in compliance with one of the 2014 Credit Agreement's financial covenants that is measured and reported on a quarterly basis. On September 23, 2016, the Company received a waiver of noncompliance with this financial covenant that is effective until October 31, 2016. As a result, the Company was in compliance with its applicable financial covenants as of   September 25, 2016  . 
  Borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement bear interest at the Company s option of either (i) the Base Rate (as such term is defined in the 2014 Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin of 0.50% to 1.50% or (ii) at a fixed rate for a period of one, two, three or six months equal to the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus the applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.50%. The applicable margins with respect to our revolving credit facility vary from time to time in accordance with agreed upon pricing grids based on our consolidated total leverage ratio. Swing-line loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest only at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin. Interest on loans based upon the Base Rate are payable on the last day of each calendar quarter in which such loan is outstanding. Interest on loans based on LIBOR is payable on the last day of the applicable LIBOR period and, in the case of any LIBOR period greater than three months in duration, interest is payable quarterly.  In addition, the Company is required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders equal to 0.20% to 0.35% per annum on the aggregate amount of the unused revolving credit facility, excluding swing-line loans, commencing on November 5, 2014, payable quarterly in arrears. As of   September 25, 2016  , we had an outstanding balance of   $51.0 million   on our revolving credit facility. 
  On October 31, 2016, the Company entered into the Amendment. The Amendment redefines the Company's senior credit facilities and provides for (i) a $35.0 million term loan facility, maturing in 2019, and (ii) a revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $30.0 million (including a sublimit cap of up to $10.0 million for letters of credit and up to $10.0 million for swing-line loans), maturing in 2019. Additionally, the Company is no longer allowed to increase the revolving credit facility by up to   $25.0 million  .  
  Borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at a fixed rate for a period of one, two, three or six months equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin of 2.50% to 3.00%.  In addition to making fixed quarterly principal payments under the Company s senior credit facilities, the Company is required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders equal to 0.30% to 0.50% per annum on the aggregate amount of the unused revolving credit facility, excluding swing-line loans, commencing on October 31, 2016, payable quarterly in arrears. The Amendment also modifies the financial tests that the Company is required to meet by removing the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio, revising the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, adding a maximum consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio and adding a minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by the Amendment.  In addition to these financial tests, the Amendment places limitations on new restaurant leases until the lease-adjusted leverage ratio meets certain thresholds. The Amendment also provides the Company with a permanent waiver of noncompliance with certain financial tests under the 2014 Credit Agreement for the thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  As part of our on-going business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities ( VIEs ), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of   September 25, 2016  , we were not involved in any VIE transactions and did not otherwise have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from what was previously reported in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Interest Rate Risk 
  We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our long term debt. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to the loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility, which is payable at variable rates. 
  At   September 25, 2016  , we had   $51.0 million   outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Each one-eighth point change in interest rates on the variable rate portion of debt under our revolving credit facility would result in an approximately $64,000 annual change in our interest expense. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market price fluctuations in some of our food product prices. Given the historical volatility of our food product prices, these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs. While we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations, there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control. We currently do not contract for any of our fresh seafood and we are unable to contract for some of our commodities such as certain produce items for periods longer than one week. Consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Because we typically set our menu prices in advance of our food product prices, we cannot immediately take into account changing costs of food items. To the extent that we are unable to pass the increased costs on to our guests through price increases, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market price fluctuations related to any of our food product prices at this time. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure 
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered in this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including the accumulation and communication of disclosure to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
  The design of any system of control is based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all future events, no matter how remote, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may not deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 

FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WAIVER 

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WAIVER   (this    Amendment   ), dated as of October 31, 2016, is by and among   BRAVO BRIO RESTAURANT GROUP, INC.  , an Ohio corporation (the    Borrower   ), the Guarantors party hereto, the Lenders party hereto and   WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION  , as administrative agent on behalf of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (in such capacity, the    Administrative Agent   ).  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  W I T N E S S E T H 
    
  WHEREAS  , the Borrower, the Guarantors, certain banks and financial institutions named therein (the    Lenders   ) and the Administrative Agent are parties to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of November 5, 2014 (as amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the    Existing Credit Agreement     
    
  WHEREAS  , the Borrower previously informed the Administrative Agent that it would be in violation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant set forth in Section 5.9(b) of the Existing Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ended on or about September 25, 2016 resulting in an Event of Default under Section 7.1(c)(i) of the Existing Credit Agreement as of such date (the    Specified Event of Default   ) (which Specified Event of Default was waived by the Lenders in a limited manner pursuant to that certain Waiver Agreement dated as of September 23, 2016); 
    
  WHEREAS  , the Credit Parties have requested that the Lenders (i) permanently waive the Specified Event of Default and (ii) amend certain provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement; 
    
     WHEREAS  , the Lenders (i) are willing to permanently waive the Specified Event of Default and (ii) have agreed to amend the Existing Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions hereof;  
    
  WHEREAS  , concurrently with the effectiveness of this Amendment, the Lenders have agreed to convert an aggregate principal amount of $35,000,000 of Revolving Loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement to Term Loans (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as set forth in   Section 3.1   below in the amounts and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the agreements hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

In addition, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any portion of a LIBOR Rate Loan to an Alternate Base Rate Loan by giving the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice thereof by 11:00 A.M. one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed date of conversion.  If the date upon which an Alternate Base Rate Loan is to be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan is not a Business Day, then such conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and during the period from such last day of an Interest Period to such succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it were an Alternate Base Rate Loan.  LIBOR Rate Loans may only be converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the last day of the applicable Interest Period.  If the date upon which a LIBOR Rate Loan is to be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan is not a Business Day, then such conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and during the period from such last day of an Interest Period to such succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it were an Alternate Base Rate Loan.  All or any part of outstanding Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein;   provided   that (i) no Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) partial conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.  All or any part of outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein;   provided   that partial conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. 
    
  (b)    Any LIBOR Rate Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in Section 2.9(a);   provided  , that no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case such Loan shall be automatically converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto.  If the Borrower shall fail to give timely notice of an election to continue a LIBOR Rate Loan, or the continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans is not permitted hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto. 

Section 2.10      Computation of Interest and Fees  . 
    
  (a)    Interest payable hereunder with respect to any Alternate Base Rate Loan based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed.  All other fees, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change. 
    
  (b)    Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Credit Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate. 
    
  (c)    It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect.  All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of this subsection which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral.  In no way, nor in any  

event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under Applicable Law.  If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such interest shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under Applicable Law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document.  If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under Applicable Law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans.  The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand.  All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by Applicable Law. 

Section 2.11      Pro Rata Treatment and Payments  . 
    
  (a)      Allocation of Payments Prior to Exercise of Remedies  .  Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction of the Commitments shall be made   pro     rata   according to the respective Pro Rata Shares of the Revolving Lenders.  Unless otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement, each payment under this Credit Agreement shall be applied,   first  , to any fees then due and owing by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5,   second  , to interest then due and owing hereunder and,   third  , to principal then due and owing hereunder.  Each payment on account of any fees pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be made   pro     rata   in accordance with the respective amounts due and owing (except as to the Letter of Credit Facing Fees and the Issuing Lender Fees, which shall be paid to the Issuing Lender).  Each optional repayment and prepayment by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest (i) on the Revolving Loans shall be applied to such Loans on a pro rata basis and (ii) on Term Loan shall be applied in the inverse order of maturities on the remaining scheduled principal installments thereof, in each case, to the extent applicable, in accordance with the terms of Section 2.7(a) hereof.  Each mandatory prepayment on account of principal of the Loans shall be applied to such Loans, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.7(b).  All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set off or counterclaim (except as provided in Section 2.17(b)) and shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the Administrative Agent s office specified on Section 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date when due.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.  If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
    
  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Exercise of Remedies  .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the exercise of remedies (other than the application of default interest pursuant to Section 2.8(b)) by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.2 (or after the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the Loans (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts under the Credit Documents (including without limitation the maximum amount of all contingent liabilities  
  
   38 

under Letters of Credit) shall automatically become due and payable in accordance with the terms of such Section), all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under the Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows (irrespective of whether the following costs, expenses, fees, interest, premiums, scheduled periodic payments or Credit Party Obligations are allowed, permitted or recognized as a claim in any proceeding resulting from the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event): 
    
  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys  fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents; 
    
  SECOND, to the payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender; 
    
  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender; 
    
  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest, and including, with respect to any Secured Hedging Agreement and any Secured Cash Management Agreement, any fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments due under such Secured Hedging Agreement or such Secured Cash Management Agreement and any interest accrued thereon, respectively; 
    
  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Credit Party Obligations, including the payment or Cash Collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations and, with respect to any Secured Hedging Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement, any breakage, termination or other payments due under such Secured Hedging Agreement or such Secured Cash Management Agreement and any interest accrued thereon, respectively; 
    
  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses  FIRST  through  FIFTH  above; and 
    
  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. 
    
  In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (b) each of the Secured Parties shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender or the outstanding obligations payable to such Hedging Agreement Provider bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans, LOC Obligations and obligations payable under all Secured Hedging Agreements) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses  THIRD,   FOURTH,   FIFTH  and  SIXTH  above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause  FIFTH  above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Cash Collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses  FIFTH  and  SIXTH  above in the manner provided in this Section 2.11(b).  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this Section 2.11(b), only Collateral proceeds and payments under the Guaranty with respect  
  
   39

Section 2.12      Non Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent  . 
    
  (a)      Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Extension of Credit that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Extension of Credit, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Agreement and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Extension of Credit available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Extension of Credit to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Extension of Credit.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
    
  (b)      Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
    
  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
    
  (c)      Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent  .  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Extension of Credit set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms thereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
    
  (d)      Obligations of Lenders Several  .  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.5(c) are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any such payment under Section 9.5(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for  
  
   40 

the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.5(c). 
    
  (e)      Funding Source  .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 

Section 2.13      Inability to Determine Interest Rate  . 
    
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if (a) the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan or (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or any Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR, or (b) the Required Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR Rate Loan during such Interest Period     or an Alternate Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period.   
    
  Unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify their request regarding such LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR and any Loans that were requested to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall remain as or be converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR.  Until any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as, continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so affected or Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR. 

Section 2.14      Illegality  . 
    
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if , after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement or to obtain in the interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist, and (c) such Lender s Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law as Alternate Base Rate Loans (provided that if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a LIBOR Rate Loan, the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan shall immediately be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan).  The Borrower hereby agrees to promptly pay any Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender in making any repayment in accordance with this Section including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender  
  
   41 

to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder.  A certificate (which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the computation) as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section;   provided  ,   however  , that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material. 

Section 2.15      Requirements of Law  . 
    
  (a)    If any Change in Law: 
    
  (i)    shall subject such Lender to any tax (other than (x) Taxes the indemnification of which is addressed by Section 2.17 and (y) those taxes listed as excluded in the definition of  Taxes  as set forth in Section 2.17) of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Letter of Credit, any participation therein or any application relating thereto, any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); 
    
  (ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or 
    
  (iii)    shall impose on such Lender any other condition; 
    
  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans, Alternate Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or the Letters of Credit or the participations therein or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or under any Note,     LIBOR Rate Loan or Letter of Credit, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Lender reasonably deems to be material as determined by such Lender with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans or Letters of Credit.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable and setting out in reasonable detail the determination thereof pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph of this Section;   provided  ,   however  , that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender to be material. 
    
  (b)    If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount as shall be certified by such Lender as being required to compensate it for such reduction suffered from and after the date which is 180 days before the day such Lender first notifies the Borrower thereof and requests compensation.  Such  
  
   42 

a certificate as to any additional amounts payable under this Section submitted by a Lender (which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the computation and computation thereof in reasonable detail), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
    
  (c)    The agreements in this Section 2.15 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. 

Section 2.16      Indemnity  . 
    
  The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) the failure by the Borrower to pay the principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, (b) the failure of the Borrower to accept a borrowing after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) the failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans hereunder.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  The agreements in this Section shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations.  This Section 2.16 shall not apply with respect to taxes. 

Section 2.17      Taxes  . 
    
  (a)    All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note will be, except as provided in Section 2.17(b), made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (but excluding, with respect to any Recipient, (i) any taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or profits of a Recipient, any franchise taxes, and any branch profit taxes that are, in each case (A) imposed pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Recipient is organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Recipient is located or any subdivision thereof or therein or (B) Other Connection Taxes, (ii) any U.S. Federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA, (iii) any U.S. Federal backup withholding taxes, (iv) in the case of a Lender, U.S. Federal withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable under any Credit Document pursuant to a law in effect on the date on which (A) such Lender acquires such interest in the Loan, Commitment or Note (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Borrower under Section 9.19) or (B) such Lender changes its lending office, except in each case to the extent that, pursuant to this Section 2.17, amounts with respect to such taxes were payable either to such Lender's assignor immediately before such Lender became a party hereto or to such Lender immediately before it changed its lending office, (v) any taxes attributable to such Recipient s failure to comply with Section 2.17(b) or (c) and (vi) any interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect to any tax described in (i) through (v)) (all such non excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as    Taxes   ).  If any taxes are so levied or imposed under applicable law, the Borrower agrees to withhold such taxes and pay the full amount thereof to the relevant taxing authority.  If taxes so withheld are properly treated as Taxes hereunder, the Borrower will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to the applicable Recipient so that every payment of all amounts due under this Credit Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note.  The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to Applicable Law certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold  
  
   43 

harmless each Recipient, and reimburse such Recipient upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Recipient. 
    
  (b)    Each Foreign Lender agrees, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 9.6 (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) if the Lender is a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W 8BEN-E or W 8ECI (or successor forms) certifying such Lender s entitlement to an exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either (x) Internal Revenue Service Form W 8BEN-E or W 8ECI as set forth in clause (i) above, or (y) a certificate in substantially the form of   Exhibit 2.16   (any such certificate, a    Tax Exempt Certificate   ) and two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W 8BEN-E (or successor form) certifying such Lender s entitlement to an exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Credit Agreement and under any Note.  In addition, each Lender agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower s request updated versions of the foregoing, as applicable, whenever the previous certification has become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to any available exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement and any Note.   
    
  If a payment made to any Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this paragraph,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
    
  Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender s status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Requirements of Law of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Requirements of Law and which such Lender is able to lawfully complete and deliver, to confirm such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the United States by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction.  Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such  claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the sole judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Requirements of Law of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.  Additionally, the Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the  
  
   44 

Requirements of Law of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by the Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Requirements of Law in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Credit Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction. 
    
  (c)    Any Lender that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower of the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax. 
    
  (d)    Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section;   provided  ,   however  , that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material. 
    
  (e)    If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant to this Section 2.17 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax liabilities on account of such payment;   provided   that such Lender shall have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax credit position or (ii) it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it.  In the event that such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower.  In the event that no refund or credit is obtained with respect to the Borrower s payments to such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17, then such Lender shall upon request provide a certification that such Lender has not received a refund or credit for such payments.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.17 shall require a Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.17 to the Borrower or any other party. 
    
  (f)    The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. 

Section 2.18      Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender s Duties  . 
    
  (a)    In addition to its other obligations under Section 2.4, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the Issuing Lender and each Revolving Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees) that the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit or (ii) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called    Government Acts   ). 
    
  (b)    As between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender and each Revolving Lender, the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.  Neither the Issuing Lender nor any Revolving Lender shall be responsible:  (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure  
  
   45 

of the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon a Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (vii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender or any Revolving Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts.  None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender s rights or powers hereunder. 
    
  (c)    In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender or any Revolving Lender, under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not put such Issuing Lender or such Revolving Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower.  It is the intention of the parties that this Credit Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify the Issuing Lender and each Revolving Lender against any and all risks involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower, including, without limitation, any and all risks of the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any Government Authority.  The Issuing Lender and the Revolving Lenders shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the Issuing Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of the Issuing Lender and the Revolving Lenders. 
    
  (d)    Nothing in this Section 2.18 is intended to limit the reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.4(b) hereof.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement.  No act or omissions of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Issuing Lender and the Revolving Lenders to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit Agreement. 
    
  (e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.18, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify the Issuing Lender or any Revolving Lender in respect of any liability incurred by the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Lender arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender (including action not taken by the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Lender), as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to arbitration. 

Section 2.19      Cash Collateral  .   
    
  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, and to the extent such Defaulting Lender s LOC Obligations and its Swingline Exposure cannot be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares as provided in Section 2.20(a)(iv) below, then within three (3) Business Days following the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, the Borrower shall deliver Cash Collateral to the Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.20 and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender). 
    
  (a)      Grant of Security Interest  .  All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative Agent.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to clause (b) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by  
  
   46 

the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 
    
  (b)      Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section or Section 2.20 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans, shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific LOC Obligations, Swingline Loans, Participation Interests therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
    
  (c)      Release  .  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee)), or (ii) the Issuing Lender s or Swingline Lender s, as applicable, good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;   provided  ,   however  , (A) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Credit Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 2.11), and (B) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 

Section 2.20      Defaulting Lenders  .   
    
  (a)      Adjustments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: 
    
  (i)      Waivers and Amendments  .  Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 9.1. 
    
  (ii)      Reallocation of Payments  . Any payment of principal, interest, fees (to the extent payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(a)(iii)) or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:   first  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender hereunder;   second  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender in respect of any Participation Interest in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit;   third  , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;   fourth  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans and other amounts under this Agreement;   fifth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   sixth  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   seventh  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that  
  
   47 

if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LOC Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its Pro Rata Share, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LOC Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LOC Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
    
  (iii)      Defaulting Lender Fees  .  
    
  (A)      Commitment Fees  .  A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which it is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such Commitment Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender), except that such Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a Commitment Fee with respect to the sum of (1) the outstanding amount of the Loans theretofore funded by such Defaulting Lender, and (2) such Defaulting Lender s Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.19 and Section 2.20. 
    
  (B)      Letter of Credit Fees  .  A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Letter of Credit Fee for any period during which it is a Defaulting Lender, except that a Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a Letter of Credit Fee with respect to each Letter of Credit or portion thereof for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.19 and Section 2.20.  With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee that a Defaulting Lender is not entitled to receive in accordance with the terms of this Section, such Letter of Credit Fee shall be paid to the non-Defaulting Lenders to the extent such Defaulting Lender s LOC Obligations have been reallocated to the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with clause (iv) below;   provided   that if any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LOC Obligations have not been reallocated to the Non-Defaulting Lenders and have not been Cash Collateralized by the Defaulting Lender (the    Exposed LOC Obligations   ), the Letter of Credit Fees corresponding to the Exposed LOC Obligations (1) shall not be payable by the Borrower to the extent the Borrower has Cash Collateralized such Exposed LOC Obligations and (2) shall be payable to the Issuing Lender to the extent the Borrower has not Cash Collateralized such Exposed LOC Obligations. 
    
  (iv)      Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s LOC Obligations and its Swingline Exposure shall automatically (effective on the day such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that (i) no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of such reallocation and (ii) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Committed Funded Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. 
    
  (v)      Cash Collateral  .  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, immediately following notice by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, (x) first, repay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize such Defaulting Lender s LOC Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (iv) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.19 for so long as such LOC Obligations are outstanding. 

48 

(b)      Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender each agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Defaulting Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded Participation Interests to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares (without giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and   provided  ,   further  , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
    
  (c)      Termination of Commitment  .  The Borrower may terminate the entire Commitment of a Defaulting Lender to the extent there are no Loans or Letters of Credit outstanding at the time of such termination upon not less than ten Business Days  prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof);   provided   that (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (B) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.

  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that affects such Participant.

A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.15 and 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.   
    
  (f)      Certain Pledges  .

Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party other than payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations), including without limitation any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Credit Party Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations.  The Administrative Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales (to the extent such sale is permitted by Applicable Law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against the Borrower or any other party or any security. 
    
  (b)        Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Credit Party Obligations.  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Credit Party Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks. 
    
  (c)        Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of any Secured Party against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Secured Party (collectively, the    Other Parties   ) and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.  Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to or for the benefit of the Secured Parties to secure payment of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower until such time as the Credit Party Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated. 
  
   99 

Section 10.8        Limitation on Enforcement  . 
    
  The Secured Parties agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no Secured Party shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the terms of this Credit Agreement and under any Secured Hedging Agreement.  The Secured Parties further agree that this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Guarantors. 

Section 10.9        Confirmation of Payment  . 
    
  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after payment of the Credit Party Obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty and termination of the Commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower, the Guarantors or any other Person that such indebtedness and obligations have been paid and the Commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the provisions of Section 10.2. 

100 

Section 10.10        Keepwell  . 
    
  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each Specified Credit Party to honor all of such Specified Credit Party s obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in respect of Swap Obligations;   provided  ,   however  , that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.10 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 10.10 or otherwise under this Agreement voidable under Applicable Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount. The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.10 shall remain in full force and effect until the Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.10 constitute, and this Section 10.10 shall be deemed to constitute, a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of Section la(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
