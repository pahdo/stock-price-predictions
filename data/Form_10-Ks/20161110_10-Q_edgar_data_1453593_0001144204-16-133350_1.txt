Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements  

(1)  
      Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Business Description   

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. ( Xtant ), formerly known as
Bacterin International Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bacterin International, Inc.,
( Bacterin ) a Nevada corporation, Xtant Medical, Inc. ( Xtant Medical ), a Delaware corporation, and X-spine
Systems, Inc. ( X-spine ), an Ohio corporation, (Xtant, Xtant Medical, Bacterin and X-spine are jointly referred
to herein as the  Company ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Xtant
develops, manufactures and markets orthopedic products for domestic and international markets. Xtant products serve the combined
specialized needs of orthopedic and neurological surgeons, including orthobiologics for the promotion of bone healing, implants
and instrumentation for the treatment of spinal disease, tissue grafts for the treatment of orthopedic disorders to promote healing
following spine, cranial and surgeries and the development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices for use in orthopedic spinal
surgeries. The Company also previously developed and licensed coatings for various medical device applications. 

On July 31, 2015,
Xtant acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of X-spine Systems, Inc. for approximately $60 million in cash, repayment of
approximately $13 million of X-spine debt, and approximately 4.24 million shares of Xtant common stock (See Note 2,  Business
Combination  below). Following the closing of the acquisition, on July 31, 2015, Bacterin International Holdings, Inc. changed
its name to Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. On August 6, 2015, Xtant formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Xtant Medical, to facilitate
the integration of Bacterin and X-spine. 

The markets in which
the Company competes are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological advances, changes in customer requirements,
or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect the Company s operating
results. The Company s business could be harmed by a decline in demand for, or in the prices of, its products or as a result
of, among other factors, any change in pricing or distribution methods, increased price competition, changes in government regulations
or a failure by the Company to keep up with technological change.  Further, a decline in available donors could have
an adverse impact on our business. 

The accompanying interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of Xtant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited
and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They do not include
all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements, but in the opinion of management,
include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results which may be achieved in the future for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto which are included in Xtant s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accounting policies set forth in those annual financial statements are the
same as the accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements, except as modified for appropriate interim
financial statement presentation. 

Concentrations and Credit Risk  

The
Company s accounts receivable are due from a variety of health care organizations and distributors throughout the
world. Approximately 95% of sales were in the United States for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  No
single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue or accounts receivable for the comparable periods. The Company
provides for uncollectible amounts when specific credit issues arise. Management s estimates for uncollectible amounts
have been adequate during prior periods, and management believes that all significant credit risks have been identified at
September 30, 2016. 

In the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Xtant purchased from Norwood Medical approximately 12% of its operating products (See Note 15,  Related
Party Transactions  below). 

Revenue by geographical
region is as follows: 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
the financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Significant estimates include the carrying amount of property
and equipment, goodwill, and intangible assets and liabilities; valuation allowances for trade receivables, inventory, and deferred
income tax assets and liabilities; valuation of the warrant derivative liability, inventory and estimates for the fair value
of stock options grants and other equity awards upon which the Company determines stock-based compensation expense. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Long-Lived Assets  

Long-lived assets,
including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair
value of the assets. (See Note 5,  Impairment of Assets  below.) 

Goodwill  

Goodwill represents
the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business
combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, instead they are tested for impairment at least annually
and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. In its evaluation of goodwill,
the Company performs an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired
and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment. The Company conducts its annual impairment test on December
31 of each year. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized
when all of the following criteria are met: a) the Company has entered into a legally binding agreement with the customer; b) the
products or services have been delivered; c) the Company s fee for providing the products and services is fixed or determinable;
and d) collection of the Company s fee is probable. 

The Company s
policy is to record revenue net of any applicable sales, use, or excise taxes.  If an arrangement includes a right of
acceptance or a right to cancel, revenue is recognized when acceptance is received or the right to cancel has expired. 

The Company ships
to certain customers under consignment arrangements whereby the Company s product is stored by the customer.  The
customer is required to report the use to the Company and upon such notice, the Company invoices the customer and revenue is recognized
when above criteria have been met. 

Advertising Costs  

The Company expenses
advertising costs as incurred. The Company had advertising expense of $140,049 and $93,854 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Research and Development  

Research and development
costs, which are principally related to internal costs for the development of new devices and biologics and processes are expensed
as incurred. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income (expense)
primarily consists of non-recurring items that are outside of the normal Company s operations such as other related legal
expenses, gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets and miscellaneous minor adjustments to account balances. 

Net Loss Per Share  

Basic net income (loss)
per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issued
during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect
to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period, which include the assumed exercise of stock options and
warrants using the treasury stock method.  Diluted net loss per share was the same as basic net loss per share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants were
anti-dilutive as a result of the net losses incurred for those periods.  Dilutive earnings per share are not reported as their
effects of including 1,794,792 and 1,896,253 outstanding stock options and warrants for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are anti-dilutive. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying values
of financial instruments, including trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, other accrued expenses and long-term debt, approximate
their fair values based on terms and related interest rates.  

The Company follows
a framework for measuring fair value. The framework provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
are described below: 

Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology
are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology
are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

A financial instrument s
level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no reclassification in financial assets or liabilities
between Level 1, 2 or 3 categories. 

The following table
sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, our liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis:          

Warrant derivative liability 

The valuation technique
used to measure fair value of the warrant liability is based on a valuation model and significant assumptions and inputs determined
by us (See Note 11,  Warrants  below). 

Level 3 Changes 

The following is a
reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Warrant derivative liability  

During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not change any of the valuation techniques used to measure its liabilities at
fair value. 

(2)  
      Business Combination   

On July 31, 2015 (the
 Acquisition Date ), the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of X-spine. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $1,269,613 of integration related expenses and $3,325,048 of
amortization of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
We anticipate additional integration expenses to occur during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Unaudited Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information  

The unaudited pro
forma results presented below for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 include the combined results of both
entities as if the acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2015. Certain pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect
the impact of the purchase transaction, primarily consisting of amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives and interest
expense on long-term debt. In addition, certain historical expenses, such as warrant expense and interest expense associated with
debt that was immediately repaid, were eliminated from these pro-forma results. The pro forma information does not necessarily
reflect the actual results of operations had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the fiscal reporting period indicated
nor is it indicative of future operating results. The pro forma information does not include any adjustment for potential revenue
enhancements, cost synergies or other operating efficiencies that could result from the acquisition. 

We entered into the
Purchase Agreement on March 16, 2015, as amended and restated on April 17, 2015, with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate
of $10.0 million of our shares of common stock over the approximately 24-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, in the first quarter of 2015 we issued 207,182 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital
for $750,000 in aggregate proceeds, along with 154,189 shares of our common stock which were valued at $3.62 per share and included
as $558,185 on the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a commitment fee. In the first nine months
of 2016 we issued 150,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital for $300,000 in aggregate proceeds.  For
the same period in 2015, we issued 417,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital for $1,366,941 in aggregate proceeds, which
were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company did not issue any shares to Aspire Capital in the last
six months of 2015. 

Under the Purchase
Agreement, we have the right, at our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with purchase notices, directing Aspire Capital
(as principal) to purchase up to 50,000 shares of our common stock, per trading day, provided that the aggregate price of each
such purchase shall not exceed $500,000 per trading day, at a per share price equal to the lesser of: 

the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date; or  

the arithmetic average of the three lowest closing sale prices for our common stock during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the purchase date.  

In addition, we also
have the right to present Aspire Capital with volume-weighted average price purchase notices directing Aspire Capital to purchase
an amount of our common stock equal to up to 30% of the aggregate shares of our common stock on the next trading day, subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations in the Purchase Agreement. 

The Purchase Agreement
may be terminated by us at any time, at our discretion, without any penalty or cost to us. The Purchase Agreement also provides
for customary events of default, upon the occurrence of which Aspire Capital may terminate the Purchase Agreement. Aspire Capital
has agreed that neither it nor any of its agents, representatives or affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling
or hedging of our common stock during any time prior to the termination of the Purchase Agreement. Any proceeds we receive under
the Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On July 31, 2015,
the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of X-spine for approximately $60 million in cash, repayment of approximately
$13 million in debt and 4,242,655 shares of our common stock. 

Related to the acquisition,
on October 8, 2015 the Company granted 78,510 restricted stock units to five X-spine employees at $3.19 a share, for a total cost
of $250,447, to be expensed ratably over twelve months in Acquisition and integration related expenses from the Acquisition Date. 

On September 4, 2015,
the Company sold an aggregate of 140,053 shares of our common stock to certain members of our Board of Directors in a private placement
transaction for aggregate cash proceeds of $515,395.

(5)  
      Impairment of Assets   

During the third quarter
of 2015, Intangible Assets were reviewed and found to be impaired. The impact, net of amortization, was $285,224. 

(6)  
      Property and Equipment, Net   

Property and equipment,
net are as follows: 

The Company provides
surgical instruments to surgeons to use during surgical procedures. Instruments are classified as non-current assets and are recorded
as property, plant and equipment. Instruments are carried at cost and are held at book value (cost less accumulated depreciation).
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method using a five year useful life. 

The
Company leases certain equipment under capital leases. For financial reporting purposes, minimum lease payments relating to
the assets have been capitalized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $1,316,383 gross capitalized lease
assets within Equipment, and $261,574 of related accumulated depreciation. 

Maintenance and repairs
expense for the nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $427,575 and $272,811, respectively.  Depreciation expense related to
property and equipment, including property under capital lease for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $2,181,541, and $563,790,
respectively. 

(7)  
      Intangible Assets   

Intangible assets
consist of various patents with regard to processes for its products and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of X-spine. 

The following table
sets forth information regarding intangible assets: 

The following is a
summary of estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets as of September 30, 2016: 

(8)  
      Accrued Liabilities   

Accrued liabilities
consist of the following: 

On July 31, 2015,
concurrent with the acquisition of X-spine, we completed an offering of $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% convertible
senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the  Notes ) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Certain private investment funds for which OrbiMed Advisors LLC, serves
as the investment manager, purchased $52.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes directly from the Company in the offering.
On August 10, 2015, the initial purchaser exercised its option with respect to an additional $3 million aggregate principal amount
of Notes. 

The Notes bear interest
at a rate equal to 6.00% per year. Following the first interest payment date, which occurred on April 15, 2016, interest on the
Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Interest will accrue on the Notes from the
last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from July
31, 2015. Unless earlier converted or repurchased, the Notes will mature on July 15, 2021. 

At any time prior
to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Notes into
shares of Xtant common stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) at an initial conversion rate of 257.5163 shares
per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $3.88 per share). However,
a Note will not be convertible to the extent that such convertibility or conversion would result in the holder of that Note or
any of its affiliates being deemed to beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the then-outstanding shares of Xtant common stock.
The conversion rate will be subject to an adjustment as described in the Indenture for certain events, including, among others: 

the issuance of certain share and cash dividends on our common stock;  

the issuance of certain rights or warrants;  

certain subdivisions and combinations of our capital stock;  

certain distributions of capital stock, indebtedness or assets; and  

certain tender or exchange offers.  

We will not adjust
the conversion rate for other events, such as for an issuance of our common stock for cash or in connection with an acquisition
that may dilute our common stock thereby adversely affecting its market price. In addition, Xtant will, in certain circumstances,
increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Notes in connection with a  make-whole fundamental change 
(as defined in the Indenture). No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. Xtant may not redeem the Notes at its option prior to
their maturity. If a  fundamental change  (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders will have the right, at their
option, to require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date, subject to the right of holders of
Notes on a record date to receive accrued and unpaid interest. 

The Notes are Xtant s
senior, unsecured obligations, rank equal in right of payment with its existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not junior
to the Notes, are senior in right of payment to any of its existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the
Notes, and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables,
and (to the extent Xtant is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of its subsidiaries. 

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  

On July 31, 2015,
we refinanced approximately $24 million in existing term loans and borrowed an additional $18 million pursuant to an Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement with ROS (the  New Facility ). The maturity date of the New Facility is July 31, 2020 (the
 Maturity Date ). Interest under the New Facility is bifurcated into a  cash pay  portion and a  payment-in-kind 
( PIK ) portion. Until June 30, 2018 (the  First Period ), interest on loans outstanding under the New
Facility will accrue at a rate equal to the sum of (a) 9% per annum, which portion of interest will be payable in cash, plus (b)
additional interest ( PIK Interest ) in an amount equal to (i) the sum of 14% per annum, plus the higher of (x) LIBOR
and (y) 1% per annum, minus (ii) 9% per annum, which portion of interest will be payable  in kind.  During the portion
of the First Period before December 31, 2015 (the  Optional PIK Period ), we may elect at our option to have all
or any portion of interest on loans outstanding under the New Facility to accrue during the Optional PIK Period at a rate equal
to the sum of 14% per annum, plus the higher of (x) LIBOR and (y) 1% per annum, which portion of interest will be payable  in
kind.  On or after June 30, 2018 until the New Facility is repaid in full (the  Second Period ), interest on
loans outstanding under the New Facility will accrue at a rate equal to the sum of (a) 12% per annum, which portion of interest
will be payable in cash, plus (b) PIK Interest in an amount equal to the difference of (i) the sum of 14% per annum, plus the higher
of (x) LIBOR and (y) 1% per annum, minus (ii) 12% per annum, which portion of interest will be payable  in kind.  In
both the First Period and the Second Period, the portion of accrued interest constituting PIK Interest will not be payable in cash,
but will instead be added to the principal amount outstanding under the New Facility. However, at our option, we may choose to
make any  payment-in-kind  interest payment in cash. Until the third anniversary of the closing date of the New Facility,
we will not be allowed to voluntarily prepay the New Facility. Whenever loans outstanding under the New Facility are prepaid or
paid, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or on the Maturity Date, a fee of 7.5% on the amount paid will be due and payable. The
New Facility contains financial and other covenant requirements, including, but not limited to, financial covenants that require
the Company to maintain revenue and liquidity at levels set forth in the New Facility and ensure that the Company s senior
consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed levels set forth in the New Facility. The New Facility also restricts us from making
any payment or distribution with respect to, or purchasing, redeeming, defeasing, retiring or acquiring, the Notes other than payments
of scheduled interest on the Notes, issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes, and payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares. The loans under the New Facility are guaranteed by Xtant and its current and future subsidiaries and
are secured by substantially all of the current and future assets of Xtant and its subsidiaries. The additional amount borrowed
under the New Facility was used to pay a portion of the X-spine acquisition, with the balance being available for general corporate
purposes. 

We accounted for the Notes and for the
New Facility with ROS in accordance with ASC Subtopic 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments, and ASC Subtopic 470-60,
Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors. Based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the changes to the loan and applying
the calculation methodology per the above mentioned ASC Subtopics, the Company recognized a gain from the extinguishment of debt
of $2,345,019. The gain consists of the write-off of the royalty liability offset by the debt discount and capitalized expenses
associated with the original debt agreement, including amendments, with ROS. 

In addition, the Company calculated a fair
value of the New Facility on a non-recurring basis by taking the five year cash flow and discounting it at a market interest rate.
There was no significant difference between the calculated value and the stated value of the New Facility. 

Approximately $4.7 million of expenses
were incurred in conjunction with the acquisition, the issuance of convertible debt and the amendment and restatement of our credit
facility with ROS. Of that amount, approximately $2.2 million of debt issuance costs was capitalized and amortized over the
life of the debt and we expensed approximately $2.5 million in 2015 related to the acquisition itself. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3
to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This update required that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability, consistent with the required presentation
for debt discounts. As required, the update was adopted and effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2015. ASU 2015-3 did not have a material impact. 

Prior to the issuance of the New Facility,
the Company was required to pay a royalty of 1.75% on the first $45,000,000 of net sales, plus 1.0% of net sales in excess of $45,000,000.
The estimate of the royalty component of the facility over the life of the agreement resulted in a debt discount and a royalty
liability of approximately $7.4 million at the time of the issuance of the New Facility. The debt discount was amortized to interest
expense over the seven year term of the loan using the effective interest method. The royalty liability was to be accreted to $12.3
million through interest expense over the ten year term of the royalty agreement using the effective interest method. With the
issuance of the New Facility, both the debt discount and royalty liability were extinguished as part of the $2.3 million gain related
to the extinguishment of debt. 

On March 31,
2016, we entered into an amendment of the New Facility. The amendment modifies the New Facility by extending the time frame
during which the Company may elect to allow interest to accrue on its loan in lieu of making interest payments, from December
31, 2015 to March 31, 2016. The amendment also lowers the minimum liquidity requirements of the Company, by allowing the
Company to maintain a liquidity amount of $500,000 or greater through June 30, 2016. The lower minimum liquidity requirement
of $500,000 or greater was extended through January 1, 2017, pursuant to an amendment on June 30, 2016. 

On April 14, 2016, we issued $2,238,166.45
aggregate principal amount of convertible senior unsecured notes  Additional Notes  in a private placement to the OrbiMed
purchasers. The funds proceeds were utilized to pay interest due for both the Notes and New Facility on April 15, 2016. 

Both the Additional Notes and the Notes
bear interest at a rate equal to 6.00% per year. Following the first interest payment date for the Notes, which will be April 15,
2016 for the Notes, and July 15, 2016 for the Additional Notes, interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on
January 15 and July 15 of each year. Interest accrues on the Notes from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided for, from July 31, 2015 for the Notes, and April 14, 2016 for the Promissory
Notes. Unless earlier converted or repurchased, the Notes will mature on July 15, 2021. 

The Additional Notes may be converted into
shares of our common stock (together with cash in lieu of fractional shares) at an initial conversion rate of 344.8276 shares per
$1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $2.90 per share). The Additional
Notes also enjoys all other terms under the convertible credit agreement which is described above. 

On July 29, 2016 we entered into the fourth
amendment to the New Facility. The amendment modified the New Facility by including an additional  Tranche A Commitment 
in an amount up to $1,000,000 from ROS and OrbiMed, which was made available to us on July 29, 2016. 

On August 12, 2016, we entered into the
fifth amendment to the New Facility, which amended one of the negative covenants under the New Facility to take into account the
Modification Agreement. 

On September 27, 2016, we entered into
the sixth amendment to the New Facility. The sixth amendment modifies the New Facility by increasing this fee on any amounts paid
under the New Facility from 7.5% to 9.0%. Under the sixth amendment, regular interest will not accrue during the period from July
1, 2016 to September 30, 2016; however, during such period, PIK Interest will accrue at a rate per annum equal to 9.00%, and such
PIK Interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the loans at September 30, 2016. The sixth amendment also modifies
the negative covenants of the New Facility by increasing the amount of purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease liabilities
allowed to be incurred by us and lowering the minimum revenue base for the quarters ending September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2016. 

Loan and Security Agreement  

On May 25, 2016, we entered into a Loan
and Security Agreement (the  LSA ) with Silicon Valley Bank, a California corporation (the  Bank ), pursuant
to which the Bank agreed to provide us with a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $6,000,000, bearing
interest at a floating per annum rate equal to one percentage point (1.00%) above the Prime Rate (as that term is defined in the
LSA). The line of credit is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in certain of our assets in favor of the Bank.
The maturity date of the revolving line of credit is May 25, 2019. 

As a condition to the extension of credit
under the LSA, we agreed to enter into an Intellectual Property Security Agreement with the Bank, dated May 25, 2016, and to take
such other actions as the Bank may request in its good faith business judgment to perfect and maintain a perfected security interest
in favor of the Bank in our intellectual property. 

On August 12, 2016, we entered into a First
Loan Modification Agreement (the  Modification Agreement ) with the Bank, which amended certain provisions of the LSA.
Pursuant to the terms of the Modification Agreement, the Bank increased the aggregate principal amount of the revolving line of
credit to $11,000,000. Any principal amounts outstanding now bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to four percentage
points (4.00%) above the Prime Rate (as that term is defined in the Modification Agreement). 

Long-term debt consists
of the following: 

The following is a
summary of maturities due on the debt as of September 30, 2016: 

(10)  
      Stock-Based Compensation   

The Amended and Restated
Xtant Medical Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) provides for stock awards, including options and performance stock
awards, to be granted to employees, consultants, independent contractors, officers and directors. The purpose of the Plan is to
enable us to attract, retain and motivate key employees, directors and, on occasion, independent consultants, by providing them
with stock options and restricted stock grants. Stock options granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options to employees,
as defined in Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or non-qualified stock options. The Plan is administered by the
compensation committee of our Board of Directors. Stock options granted under the Plan are generally not transferable, vest in
installments over the requisite service period and are exercisable during the stated contractual term of the option only by such
optionee. The exercise price of all incentive stock options granted under the Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value
of the shares of common stock on the date of the grant. 1,900,000 shares are currently authorized under the Plan and at September
30, 2016, we had approximately 530,000 million shares available for issuance which are authorized, but unissued or reacquired
shares. 

Stock compensation
expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects an estimate of awards that will be forfeited. ASC 718 requires forfeitures
to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

The estimated fair
value of stock options granted is done using the Black-Scholes-Merton method applied to individual grants. Key assumptions used
to estimate the fair value of stock awards are as follows: 

Stock option activity,
including options granted under the Plan and the Non-Plan Grants, was as follows: 

The aggregate
intrinsic value of options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 was zero because the closing price of the stock at September
30, 2016 was less than the strike price of all options outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, there were
409,179 unvested options with a weighted average fair value at the grant date of $12.67 per option. As of September
30, 2016, we had approximately $700,000 in compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized. 

From time to time
we may grant stock options and stock grants to consultants. We account for consultant stock options in accordance with ASC 505-50.
Consulting expense for the grant of stock options to consultants is determined based on the estimated fair value of the stock options
at the measurement date as defined in ASC 505-50 and is recognized over the vesting period. The Company recognized expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of zero and $140,869, respectively, as Non-cash consulting expense. 

Total share based
compensation recognized for employees, directors and consultants was $479,289 and $444,352 for the quarters ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

On July 1, 2015, the
39,312 shares of restricted stock units granted by the Company on November 10, 2014 to the independent Directors of the Company
vested. These restricted shares were issued when the stock price was $4.07 per share. The total expense of $160,000 was recognized
ratably over the vesting period as Non-cash consulting expense. 

On July 1, 2015, the
Company granted 58,820 restricted stock units to the independent Directors of the Company. These restricted shares vested on July
1, 2016 and were granted when the stock price was $3.40 per share. The total expense of $200,000 was recognized ratably over the
period as Non-cash consulting expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $100,000 was expensed. 

On October 8, 2015
the Company granted 78,510 restricted stock units to five X-spine employees at $3.19 a share for a total cost of $250,447 to be
expensed ratably from the Acquisition Date over the vesting period as Acquisition and integration related expense. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, $55,995 was expensed.  

Also, on October 8,
2015, the Company granted 20,000 restricted stock units to four Xtant area sales vice presidents at $3.19 a share for a total cost
of $65,550 to be expensed ratably over the vesting period as General and administrative expense. In the nine months ended September
30, 2016, $15,888 was expensed. 

On , July 20 2016,
the Company granted 300,000 incentive stock options to three Xtant area sales vice presidents at $1.77 a share for a total cost
of $531,000 to be expensed ratably over the vesting period as General and administrative expense. In the nine months ended September
30, 2016, $83,833 was expensed. 

On July 5, 2016, the
Company granted 80,404 restricted stock units to four of the independent Directors of the Company (Messrs. Lopach, Swanson, Deedrick
and Buckman). These restricted shares vest on July 5, 2017 and were granted when the stock price was $1.99 per share. The total
expense of $160,004 is being recognized ratably over the period as Non-cash consulting expense. In the nine months ended September
30, 2016, $42,000 was expensed. 

On July 5, 2016, the
Company granted 59,400 stock options to two of the independent Directors of the Company (Messrs. Mazzocchi and Timko). These stock
options vest on July 5, 2017 and were granted when the stock price was $1.99 per share. The total expense of $118,206 is being
recognized ratably over the period as Non-cash consulting expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $10,000 was expensed. 

On October 6, 2016,
we issued an option to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock at $1.11 per share to our President, Carl O Connell, outside
of our Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan. 

The following table summarizes our warrant
activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2016:   

We utilize a valuation model to determine
the fair market value of the warrants accounted for as liabilities. The valuation model accommodates the probability of exercise
price adjustment features as outlined in the warrant agreements. We recorded an unrealized gain of $716,738 resulting from
the change in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability for the first nine months of 2016. Under the terms of some of
our warrant agreements, at any time while the warrant is outstanding, the exercise price per share can be reduced to the price
per share of future subsequent equity sales of our common stock or a common stock equivalent that is lower than the exercise price
per share as stated in the warrant agreement. 

The estimated fair
value was derived using a valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  

The following table
summarizes our activities related to warrants accounted for as a derivative liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015: 

(12)  
      Commitments and Contingencies   

Operating Leases  

We lease four office
facilities under non-cancelable operating lease agreements with expiration dates in 2016, 2019, 2023 and 2025. We have the option
to extend the four leases for up to another ten year term and for one facility, we have the right of first refusal on any sale.
We lease additional office space under a month-to-month arrangement. 

On October 23, 2015,
the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction for the property located at 664 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana, 59714 which
formerly secured the 6% loan payable to Valley Bank of Belgrade. Our new lease agreement
has a ten year term with an option to extend for two additional five year terms for a total of ten years. 

Future minimum
payments for the next five years and thereafter as of September 30, 2016, under these leases, are as follows:  

Rent expense was $661,219 and
$458,814 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense is determined using the straight-line
method of the minimum expected rent paid over the term of the agreement. We have no contingent rent agreements. 

Indemnifications  

Our arrangements generally
include limited warranties and certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products or services infringe
a third-party s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such warranties
or indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying financial statements. 

We have also agreed
to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement
amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be,
made a party by reason of the person s service as a director or officer, including any action by us, arising out of that
person s services as our director or officer or that person s services provided to any other company or enterprise
at our request. 

Litigation   

On March 17, 2014,
a complaint was served on the Company in the following state court action in the District Court for the County of Arapahoe, State
of Colorado: Robert Taggart v. Guy Cook, Bacterin International, Inc., a Nevada Corporation and Bacterin International Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, Civil Action No. 14CV30401. The complaint involves claims under an employment agreement between plaintiff
and the Company seeking commissions on Company sales, a commission on funds obtained by the Company as a result of a reverse merger
and vesting of certain stock options and was settled in the quarter ending March 31, 2016. 

We are also engaged
in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, including product liability disputes. 

In evaluating the
realizability of the net deferred tax assets, we take into account a number of factors, primarily relating to the ability to generate
taxable income. Where it is determined that it is likely that we will be unable to realize deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance
is established against the portion of the deferred tax asset. Because it cannot be accurately determined when or if we will become
profitable, a valuation allowance was provided against the entire deferred income tax asset balance. 

The Company did not
recognize any interest or penalties related to income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

      Related Party Transactions   

Darrel Holmes, our
former Chief Operating Officer of our Bacterin subsidiary, serves on the board of American Donor Services Inc. ( ADS ).
Mr. Holmes receives $5,000 per year for his service to ADS. ADS recovers tissue from donors and we reimburse ADS for its recovery
fees, which are comprised primarily of labor costs. The approximate aggregate amount of all transactions with ADS for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $844,643 and $1,367,487, respectively. Our relationship with ADS has benefited
us, as ADS provides us with current donors and a pipeline for future donors, which is necessary to our success. 

Certain of X-spine s
former shareholders now own over 10% of our common stock as of the Acquisition Date, and have owned a controlling interest of X-spine s
largest supplier, Norwood Tool Company d/b/a Norwood Medical.  In the first nine months of 2016, Xtant purchased from Norwood
Medical approximately 12% of its operating products. 

Unless delegated to
the Compensation Committee by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee or the disinterested members of the full Board of Directors
reviews and approves all related party transactions. 

(16)  
      Segment and Geographic Information   

The Company s
management reviews financial results and manages the business on an aggregate basis. Therefore, financial results are reported
in a single operating segment: the development, manufacture and marketing of orthopedic medical products and devices. 

The Company attributes
revenues to geographic areas based on the location of the customer. Total revenue by major geographic area is reported in Note
1,  Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  above. 

On October 6,
2016, our board of directors appointed Carl D. O Connell to serve as the President of the Company. His appointment
became effective October 6, 2016. In connection with the hiring of Mr. O Connell, we issued him an option to purchase
300,000 shares of our common stock at $1.11 per share which start vesting 60,000 shares on October 6, 2017 and then
vest 15,000 shares per quarter on January 6, 2018 until October 6, 2021. 

On October 31, 2016,
the Company distributed to holders of its Common Stock and to holders of its convertible notes, at no charge, non-transferable
subscription rights to purchase units. Each unit consisted of one share of Common Stock and one tradable warrant representing the
right to purchase one share of Common Stock ( Tradeable Warrants ). The offering of units pursuant to the subscription
rights is referred to as the  Rights Offering.  On October 31, 2016, the Company entered into a dealer-manager agreement
(the  Dealer-Manager Agreement ) with Maxim Group LLC ( Maxim ), to engage Maxim as dealer-manager for
the Rights Offering. 

In the Rights Offering,
holders received two subscription rights for each share of Common Stock, or each share of Common Stock underlying our convertible
notes owned on the record date, October 21, 2016. Subscribers whose subscriptions otherwise would have resulted in their beneficial
ownership of more than 4.99% of the Company s Common Stock could elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Common Stock in excess
of that threshold, pre-funded warrants to purchase the same number of shares of Common Stock for $0.01 ( Pre-Funded Warrants ),
and the subscription price per unit consisting of a Pre-Funded Warrant in lieu of a share of Common Stock was reduced by the $0.01
exercise price. 

The Rights
Offering commenced on October 31, 2016 and the subscription rights are expected to expire on November 14, 2016, unless
extended. The units were initially priced at $0.90 per unit. On November 9, 2016, the Company reduced the subscription price
to $0.75 per unit. Assuming that all units are sold in the Rights Offering and no elections to receive Pre-Funded Warrants
are made, we estimate that the gross proceeds from the Rights Offering will be approximately $11.3 million and the net
proceeds from the Rights Offering will be approximately $10.2 million, based on a subscription price of $0.75 per unit,
after deducting fees and expenses payable to Maxim, and after deducting other expenses payable by us and excluding any
proceeds received upon exercise of any Tradeable Warrants issued in the offering. The Tradeable Warrants are exercisable for
a period of five years for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.90 per share. After the one-year anniversary
of issuance, we may redeem the Tradable Warrants for $0.01 per Tradable Warrant if the volume weighted average price of
our Common Stock is above $2.25 for each of 10 consecutive trading days. 

In connection with
the Rights Offering, the Company will pay to Maxim a cash fee equal to 7% of the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises
of Subscription Rights. We will also reimburse Maxim up to $75,000 for expenses incurred in connection with the Rights Offering. 

Under the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in the Dealer-Manager Agreement, the Company has agreed not to issue, agree to issue or announce
the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents until 90 days after the closing date of the Rights Offering,
without the consent of Maxim, subject to certain exceptions including a pre-existing agreement, equity awards, conversion of derivative
securities and in connection with any acquisitions, partnerships or strategic transactions. 

A registration statement
on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-213350), relating to the securities being offered and sold in connection with the Rights
Offering was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on October 31, 2016. A prospectus
and prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the Rights Offering has been filed with the SEC as a part of
the registration statement and is available on the SEC s web site at http://www.sec.gov.

Results of Operation  

Comparison of Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015  

As with all line items
stated in this comparison, the results for the prior year only include X-spine results as of the Acquisition Date (See Note 2,
 Business Combination  above). 

Revenue  

Total revenue
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased approximately 30.5% to $23,094,140 compared to $17,693,020 in the
prior year. The increase of $5,401,119 is mostly due to the X-spine acquisition. 

Cost of sales  

Costs of sales consist
primarily of manufacturing costs and depreciation of surgical trays. Costs of sales increased by 17.9% or $1,078,368 to
$7,114,041 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $6,035,673 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales
as a percent of total sales was 30.8% of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 34.1% in the third quarter
ended 2015. The decrease is primarily the result of economies of scale and customer mix related to the X-Spine acquisition. 

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses
include general and administrative expenses, selling and marketing expenses, depreciation, research and development expenses, and
compensation costs, including incentive compensation.  Operating expenses increased 8.1%, or $1,341,648 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the reasons set forth below
and the expenses due to the X-spine acquisition which includes  Acquisition and integration related expenses . 

General and Administrative  

General and administrative
expenses consist principally of corporate personnel, cash based and stock option compensation related costs and corporate expenses
for legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as occupancy costs. General and administrative expenses decreased 5.2%,
or $207,568, to $3,773,236 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease is
mostly due to cost containment efforts.  

Sales and Marketing  

Sales and marketing
expenses primarily consist of costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, costs for trade shows, sales conventions
and meetings, travel expenses, advertising and other sales and marketing related costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased
33.4%, or $2,812,517, to $11,242,820 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,430,303 for the same period
of 2015. The increase is almost all due to the acquisition of X-spine. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses
remained flat of 48.7% in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 47.6% for the same period of 2015.  

Research and Development  

Research and development
expenses consist primarily of internal costs for the development of new technologies and processes for our orthopedic product lines.
Research and development expenses increased $134,466 or 16.9% from $794,464 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $928,930 for
the same period of 2016. All of the increase is due to the acquisition of X-spine. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization
expense consists of depreciation of long-lived property and equipment, patents and intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition
of X-spine. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $275,730 to $1,265,490 for the quarter ended September 30,
2016, from $1,541,220 in the same period in 2015. Almost all of the decrease is due to a lower amortization of the intangible assets
that resulted from the acquisition of X-spine. 

Acquisition and Integration Related Expenses  

Acquisition and Integration
related expenses are $517,083 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Acquisition related expenses consisted of investment
banking, accounting, consulting, legal fees and miscellaneous expenses associated with the due diligence and execution of the acquisition.
Integration related expenses, which accounted for all of the expenses this quarter, consist of samples, travel and meeting, severance
due to reduction in force, retention bonuses and software. We anticipate relatively few additional expenses to occur during the
fourth quarter of 2016. 

Non-cash Consulting Expense  

Non-cash consulting expense
consists of non-cash expense associated with granting restricted stock and stock to directors and consultants. Non-cash consulting
expense increased $106,129 to $156,129 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $50,000 in the same period in the
prior year due to an increase in the number of restricted shares issued. 

Interest Expense  

Interest expense is
from our debt instruments. Interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $1,051,813 to $3,163,534, as
compared to $2,111,721 in the same period ended 2015. The increase in interest expense is due to a full quarter s expense
long-term and convertible debt issued in part to finance the acquisition of X-spine as opposed to two months in the prior year. 

Change in Warrant Derivative Liability  

For the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain in its non-cash warrant derivative liability of $220,409 which was primarily
driven by a decrease in the closing price of the Company s common stock at September 30, 2016, compared to June 30, 2016.
The liability is associated with the issuance of warrants as part of the Company s prior convertible debt financing, the
Company s 2010 financing and the Company s 2014 equity financing which contains certain provisions requiring the Company
to record a change in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability from period to period. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other  expense
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was ($51,350) as compared to an expense of ($89,926) in the same period in 2015.

miscellaneous minor adjustments to account balances.

of sales as a percent of total sales was 31.7% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 34.7% in the
first nine months of 2015. The decrease is primarily the result of changes in product and customer mix related to the X-Spine acquisition
and increased economies of scale.

include general and administrative expenses, selling and marketing expenses, depreciation, research and development expenses, and
compensation costs, including incentive compensation.  Operating expenses increased 58.9%, or $18,965,167 for the

Integration related expenses are $1,269,613 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Acquisition related expenses

compared to $4,930,941 in the same period ended 2015. The increase in interest expense is due to increased long-term and convertible
debt issued in part to finance the acquisition of X-spine. 

Change in Warrant Derivative Liability  

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain in its non-cash warrant derivative liability of $716,738 which was primarily
driven by a decrease in the closing price of the Company s common stock at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.
The liability is associated with the issuance of warrants as part of the Company s prior convertible debt financing, the
Company s 2010 financing and the Company s 2014 equity financing which contains certain provisions requiring the Company
to record a change in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability from period to period. 

Non-Cash Consideration Associated with
Stock Agreement  

In the first nine
months of 2015 154,189 shares of our common valued at $3.62 per share or $558,185 issued to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was ($309,924) as compared to
an expense of ($193,052) in the same period in 2015. Other income (expense) includes other related legal settlement income or expense,
gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets and miscellaneous minor adjustments to account balances. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Since our inception,
we have historically financed our operations through operating cash flows, as well as the private placement of equity securities
and convertible debt, an equity credit facility and other debt transactions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we received
$300,000 and $2,118,483 in the same period last year from the sale of our common stock to Aspire Capital pursuant to a Purchase
Agreement. See Note 3,  Equity , describing the Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital. At September 30, 2016, we had
$17,234,738 of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 

Net cash
used from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,194,999 from various operating
activities. For the comparable period of 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $9,027,080. 

October 31, 2016, the
Company commenced the Rights Offering. In the Rights Offering, holders received two subscription rights for each share of Common
Stock, or each share of Common Stock underlying our convertible notes owned on the record date, October 21, 2016. Subscribers whose
subscriptions otherwise would have resulted in their beneficial ownership of more than 4.99% of the Company s Common Stock
could elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Common Stock in excess of that threshold, Pre-Funded Warrants. See Note 17,  Subsequent
Events  above, describing the Rights Offering. 

The subscription
rights are expected to expire on November 14, 2016, unless extended. The units were initially priced at $0.90 per unit. On
November 9, 2016, the Company reduced the subscription price to $0.75 per unit. Assuming that all units are sold in the
Rights Offering and no elections to receive Pre-Funded Warrants are made, we estimate that the gross proceeds from the Rights
Offering will be approximately $11.3 million and the net proceeds from the Rights Offering will be approximately
$10.2 million, based on a subscription price of $0.75 per unit, after deducting fees and expenses payable to Maxim, and
after deducting other expenses payable by us and excluding any proceeds received upon exercise of any Tradeable Warrants
issued in the offering. 

Net cash used in
investment activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,550,169 due mostly to purchase of property and equipment
which includes additional trays for future sales and additions to our clean room facilities in Montana. 

Net cash
generated for financing activities was $11,785,760 for the first nine months of 2016, primarily from issuance of
capital leases, convertible debt and the revolving line of credit. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any
off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to an investor in our shares. 

Cash Requirements  

We believe that our
September 30, 2016 cash on hand and accounts receivable balance of $17,234,738 along with anticipated cash receipts from sales
expected from operations and proceeds from the Aspire Capital facility and our revolving credit line will be sufficient to meet
our anticipated cash requirements through September 30, 2017. If we do not meet our revenue objectives, we may need to sell additional
equity securities, which could result in dilution to our stockholders, or seek additional loans or alternative sources of financing.
The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and
financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us,
if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our
business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.  

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk  

As a smaller reporting
company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management with
the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016.  Based upon that evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.  Under the supervision and with the participation of senior
and executive management, we conducted an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting based upon the framework Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) as outlined by COSO, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of an evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

Based on our evaluation
under the framework Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

On March 17,
2014, a complaint was served on the Company in the following state court action in the District Court for the County of Arapahoe,

as a result of a reverse merger and vesting of certain stock options and was settled in the quarter ending March 31, 2016. 

We are also engaged in ordinary routine

results.

WHEREAS , the
Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   Commission  ) a Registration Statement on

for the registration, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities Act  ), of the shares of
Common Stock and the Warrants to be sold to investors in the Offering and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants; 

WHEREAS , the
Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing to so act, in connection with
the issuance, registration, transfer, exchange and exercise of the Warrants; 

WHEREAS , the
Company desires to provide for the form and provisions of the Warrants, the terms upon which they shall be issued and exercised,
and the respective rights, limitation of rights, and immunities of the Company, the Warrant Agent, and the holders of the Warrants,
or if the Warrants are held in  street name , a Participant (as defined below) or a designee appointed by such Participant
(each, a   Holder   or   Registered Holder  ); and 

WHEREAS , all
acts and things have been done and performed which are necessary to make the Warrants, when executed on behalf of the Company and
countersigned by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent, as provided herein, the valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company,
and to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE ,
in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1.            Appointment
of Warrant Agent . The Company hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company for the Warrants, and the Warrant
Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the same in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. 

2.            Warrants . 

2.1.           Form of
Warrant . Each Warrant shall be issued in registered form only and shall be in substantially the form of  Exhibit A 
hereto, the provisions of which are incorporated herein. Each Warrant shall be signed by, or bear the facsimile signature of, the
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or other principal officer of the Company. In the event the person
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any Warrant shall have ceased to serve in the capacity in which such person signed
the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the
date of issuance. All of the Warrants shall initially be represented by one or more book-entry positions (each, a   Book-Entry
Warrant  ). 

2.2.          Effect
of Countersignature . Unless and until countersigned by, or issued bearing the facsimile signature of the Warrant Agent pursuant
to this Agreement, a Warrant shall be invalid and of no effect and may not be exercised by the holder thereof. 

2.3.          Registration . 

2.3.1.           Warrant
Register . The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (the   Warrant Register  ) for the registration of the original
issuance and the registration of transfer of the Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall issue
and register the Warrants in the names of the respective holders thereof in such denominations and otherwise in accordance with
instructions delivered to the Warrant Agent by the Company. To the extent the Warrants are eligible for the book entry and depository
services of The Depository Trust Company (  DTC Eligible  ) as of the date of issuance (the   Issuance
Date  ), all of the Warrants shall be represented by one or more Book-Entry Warrant deposited with The Depository Trust
Company (the   Depository  ) and registered in the name of Cede   Co., a nominee of the Depository. Ownership
of beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Warrant shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through,
records maintained (i) by the Depository or its nominee for each Book-Entry Warrant; (ii) by institutions that have accounts
with the Depository (such institution, with respect to a Warrant in its account, a   Participant  ); or (iii) directly
on the book-entry records of the Warrant Agent with respect only to owners of beneficial interests represented by such direct registration.
If the Warrants are not DTC Eligible as of the Issuance Date or the Depository subsequently ceases to make its book-entry settlement
system available for the Warrants, the Company may instruct the Warrant Agent regarding making other arrangements for book-entry
settlement within ten (10) days after the Depository ceases to make its book-entry settlement available. In the event that
the Company does not make alternative arrangements for book-entry settlement within ten (10) days or the Warrants are not
eligible for, or it is no longer necessary to have the Warrants available in, book-entry form, the Warrant Agent shall provide
written instructions to the Depository to deliver to the Warrant Agent for cancellation each Book-Entry Warrant, and the Company
shall instruct the Warrant Agent to deliver to the Depository definitive certificates (  Warrant Certificates  )
in physical form evidencing such Warrants. Such Warrant Certificates shall be in substantially the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . 

2.3.2.           Beneficial
Owner; Registered Holder . The term  beneficial owner  shall mean any person in whose name ownership of a beneficial
interest in the Warrants evidenced by a Book-Entry Warrant is recorded in the records maintained by the Depository or its nominee.
Prior to due presentment to the Warrant Agent for registration of transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may
deem and treat the person in whose name such Warrant is registered in the Warrant Register as the absolute owner of such Warrant
and of each Warrant represented thereby (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing on the Warrant Certificate
(as defined below) made by anyone other than the Company or the Warrant Agent), for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and for
all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 

2.4.         Uncertificated
Warrants . Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything else herein to the contrary, the Warrants may be issued in uncertificated
form. 

3.             Terms
and Exercise of Warrants . 

3.1.         Exercise
Price . Each Warrant shall, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, entitle the Registered Holder thereof, subject to the provisions
of such Warrant and of this Agreement, to purchase from the Company the number of shares of Common Stock stated therein, at the
price of $0.90 per share, subject to the adjustments provided herein. The term   Exercise Price   as used in this
Agreement shall mean the price per share at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised. 

3.2.          Duration
of Warrants . A Warrant may be exercised only during the period (the   Exercise Period  ) commencing on the
Date of Issuance and ending on ________, 2021 (the   Expiration Date  ). Each Warrant not exercised on or before
the Expiration Date shall become void, and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease
at 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the Expiration Date. 

3.3.          Exercise
of Warrants . 

3.3.1.           Payment .
Subject to the provisions of the Warrant and this Agreement, a Warrant, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, may be exercised
by the Registered Holder thereof by submitting a duly executed Election to Purchase attached to the applicable Warrant, at the
office of the Warrant Agent or at the office of its successor as Warrant Agent, which may be done by fax or email delivery, and
by paying, within two trading days of the date of exercise, in full the Exercise Price for each full share of Common Stock as to
which the Warrant is exercised (the   Aggregate Exercise Price  ), in lawful money of the United States, by cashier s
check payable to the order of the Company or by Cashless Exercise, if permitted under, and in accordance with,  Section 3.3.2 .
The Election to Purchase shall be required, along with a medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee) of any Election to Purchase
form that may be required;  provided ,  however , that if the Company s transfer agent is not participating in
the Depository s Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program and the Registered Holder requests that the shares of Common
Stock be issued or registered to a holder other than the Registered Holder, then an ink-original Election to Purchase and a medallion
guarantee shall be required. The Registered Holder may be required to deliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise
hereunder. 

3.3.2.           Cashless
Exercise . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if and only if an effective registration statement covering
the issuance of the shares of Common Stock that are subject to the Election to Purchase is not available for the issuance of such
shares of Common Stock, the Registered Holder may exercise a Warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment
otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate Exercise Price, elect instead to
receive upon such exercise the   Net Number   of shares of Common Stock determined according to the following
formula (a   Cashless Exercise  ): 

Net Number =  
      (A x B) - (A x C)   
 
      B   

For purposes of the foregoing formula: 

A =   
      the total number of shares with respect to which a Warrant is then being exercised.   

B =   
      the arithmetic average of the Closing Sale Prices (as defined below) of the Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately preceding the date the Warrant Agent receives the duly executed Election to Purchase.   

C =   
      the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable shares of Common Stock at the time of such exercise.   

The term   Closing Sale Price  
means, for any security as of any date, the last closing bid price and last closing trade price, respectively, for such security
on the NYSE MKT, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if the NYSE MKT begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does not designate
the closing bid price or the closing trade price, as the case may be, then the last bid price or the last trade price, respectively,
of such security prior to 4:00:00 PM Eastern Time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if the NYSE MKT is not the principal securities
exchange or trading market for such security, the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of such security on
the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg, or if the
foregoing do not apply, the last closing bid price or last trade price, respectively, of such security in the over-the-counter
market on the electronic bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no closing bid price or last trade price,
respectively, is reported for such security by Bloomberg, the average of the bid prices, or the ask prices, respectively, of any
market makers for such security as reported in the OTC Link or  pink sheets  by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly Pink
OTC Markets Inc.). If the Closing Sale Price cannot be calculated for a security on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases,
the Closing Sale Price of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Company and the
Registered Holder. If the Company and the Registered Holder are unable to agree upon the fair market value of such security, then
such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to  Section 8.3 . All such determinations to be appropriately adjusted for any
stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during the applicable calculation period. 

In connection with any Cashless Exercise
pursuant to this  Section 3.3.2 , the Warrant Agent will promptly deliver a copy of the Election to Purchase to the Company
to confirm the Net Number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the Cashless Exercise. The Company shall calculate
and transmit to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall have no obligation under this  Section 3.3.2  to calculate,
the Net Number of shares of Common Stock. 

For purposes of Rule 144(d) promulgated
under the Securities Act, as in effect on the date hereof, assuming the Registered Holder is not an affiliate of the Company, the
shares of Common Stock issued in a Cashless Exercise shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Registered Holder, and the holding
period for the shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date the Warrant was originally issued. Also, the
shares of Common Stock issued in a Cashless Exercise shall take on the registered characteristics of the Warrant being exercised. 

3.3.3.           Issuance
of Common Stock on Exercise . Assuming funds for exercise are paid on or before the second trading day following the date of
receipt by the Company of an Election to Purchase, then on or before the third trading day following the date upon which the Company
has received a duly executed Election to Purchase for a Warrant, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to (i)  provided 
that the transfer agent is participating in the Depository s Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder s or its designee s
balance account with the Depository through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian System, or (ii) if the transfer agent is not
participating in the Depository s Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the Holder, or at the
Holder s instruction pursuant to the delivered Election to Purchase, the Holder s agent or designee, in each case pursuant
to this clause (ii), sent by reputable overnight courier to the address specified in the applicable Election to Purchase, a certificate,
registered in the Company s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee (as indicated in the applicable Election
to Purchase), for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise. While any Warrants
remain outstanding, the Company shall maintain a transfer agent that participates in the Depository s Fast Automated Securities
Transfer Program. 

3.3.4.           Valid
Issuance . All Common Stock issued or issuable upon the proper exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement shall
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

3.3.5.           Date
of Issuance . Each person in whose name any certificate for the Common Stock is issued or to whom shares of Common Stock are
credited to such person s account at the Depository shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record
of such Common Stock as of the time that a duly executed Election to Purchase is delivered in accordance with  Section 3.3.1 ,
assuming, in the case of a Cash Exercise, payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price is made within two (2) trading days after
the delivery of the Election to Purchase, and if the payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price is not made within two (2) trading
days after the delivery of the Election to Purchase, the Holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Common
Stock on the first trading day after the date on which the Aggregate Exercise Price has been paid, irrespective of the date of
delivery of such certificate or the date the shares of Common Stock are credited to such person s account at the Depository,
except that, if the date of such delivery and/or payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such
person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the
stock transfer books are open. 

3.3.6.           Share
Delivery Failure . If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, to issue to the Holder within three (3) trading
days after receipt of the applicable Election to Purchase (the   Share Delivery Deadline  ), a certificate for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder s exercise of a Warrant or credit the
Holder s balance account with the Depository for such number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon
the Holder s exercise of the Warrants (as the case may be, but in each case without a restrictive legend) (a   Delivery
Failure  ), and if on or after such Share Delivery Deadline the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise)
shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of all or any portion of the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such exercise that the Holder so anticipated receiving from the Company, then, in addition to all other remedies
available to it, the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days (as defined below) after the Holder s request and
in the Holder s discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to 100% of the Holder s total
purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased
(including, without limitation, by any other person in respect, or on behalf, of the Holder) (the   Buy-In Price  ),
at which point the Company s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate or credit the Holder s balance account
with the Depository for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder s exercise hereunder
(as the case may be) (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to
so issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit the Holder s
balance account with the Depository for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder s
exercise hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price
over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the
shares of Common Stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date of the applicable Election to Purchase and ending
on the date immediately preceding the date of such issuance and payment under this clause (ii). The term   Business Day  
as used in this Agreement shall mean any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks are required
or authorized to close in the City of New York, State of New York. [If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder
the Common Stock subject to an Election to Purchase by the Share Delivery Deadline, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash,
as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Common Stock subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the
Common Stock on the date of the applicable Election to Purchase), $10 per trading day (increasing to $20 per trading day on the
fifth trading day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each trading day after such Share Delivery Deadline until
such shares of Common Stock are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise.] For the purposes of this provision   VWAP  
means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a) if the Common Stock is then
listed or quoted on the NYSE MKT, the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding
date) on the NYSE MKT on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg L.P. (based on a trading day
from 9:30 AM (Eastern Time) to 4:00 PM (Eastern Time)), (b) if the Common Stock is listed or quoted on the OTCQB or OTCQX,
the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on OTCQB or OTCQX as applicable,
(c) if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted for trading on OTCQB or OTCQX and if prices for the Common Stock are
then reported in the  Pink Sheets  published by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (or a similar organization or agency succeeding
to its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported, or (d) in all
other cases, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith
by the Holders of a majority in interest of the Warrants then outstanding and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the Company. 

3.4.           Beneficial
Ownership Limitation on Exercises . The Company shall not affect the exercise of any portion of a Warrant, and the Registered
Holder of such Warrant shall not have the right to exercise any portion of such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect
to such exercise, the Registered Holder (together with the Registered Holder s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group
together with the Registered Holder or any Registered Holder s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the
  Maximum Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise,  provided ,
 however , that the foregoing limitation on exercise shall not apply to any Registered Holder who, together with such Registered
Holder s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s
affiliates, owns in excess of the Maximum Percentage immediately prior to the closing of the Offering. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Registered Holder and its affiliates, and any
persons acting as a group together with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s affiliates, shall include the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence
is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, unexercised
portion of the Warrant beneficially owned by the Registered Holder and its affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together
with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s affiliates, and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised
or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by the Registered Holder and its affiliates, and
any persons acting as a group together with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s affiliates (including, without
limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
  Exchange Act  ). The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for calculating beneficial ownership in accordance
with the provisions of this  Section 3.4 . To the extent that the limitation contained in this  Section 3.4 
applies, the Registered Holder s submission of an Election to Purchase shall be deemed to be the Registered Holder s
determination of whether a Warrant is exercisable (in relation to any other securities owned by the Registered Holder together
with any affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s
affiliates) and of which portion of a Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Maximum Percentage, and the Company shall
have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status
as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of the Warrants, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock,
the Registered Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in the most recent of (1) the
Company s most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission,
as the case may be, (2) a more recent written public announcement by the Company, or (3) any other notice by the Company
or its transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written
or oral request of the Registered Holder, the Company shall within three (3) trading days confirm to the Registered Holder
the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined
after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including any Warrant, by the Registered Holder
and its affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such Registered Holder and such Registered Holder s affiliates,
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the
Registered Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of a Warrant and the
provisions of this  Section 3.4  shall continue to apply;  provided  that (y) any such increase will not be
effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (z) any such increase or decrease
will apply only to that Registered Holder. For purposes of clarity, the Common Stock underlying any Warrant in excess of the Maximum
Percentage for a Registered Holder shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by that Registered Holder for any purpose including
for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The provisions set forth herein shall
be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the other terms of this  Section 3.4 
to the extent necessary to correct any such provision which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership
limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. 

3.5.           Call
Provision . Subject to the provisions of  Section 3.5 , if, after the Date of Issuance, the VWAP (as defined in  Section 3.3.6 )
for each of 10 consecutive trading days (the   Measurement Period  ) exceeds $2.25 (subject to adjustment for
forward and reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like after the Issuance Date), then the Company may,
within one trading day of the end of such Measurement Period, call for cancellation of all or any portion of the Warrants for which
an Election to Purchase has not yet been delivered (such right, a   Call  ) for consideration equal to $0.01 per
share of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant. To exercise this right, the Company must deliver to the Holder an irrevocable
written notice (a   Call Notice  ), indicating therein the portion of unexercised portion of the Warrants to which
such notice applies. If the conditions set forth below for such Call are satisfied from the period from the date of the Call Notice
through and including the Call Date (as defined below), then any portion of the Warrants subject to such Call Notice for which
an Election to Purchase shall not have been received by the Call Date will be cancelled at 6:30 PM (Eastern Time) on the tenth
trading day after the date the Call Notice is received by the Registered Holder (such date and time, the   Call Date  )
for consideration equal to $0.01 per share of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrants. Any unexercised portion of
the Warrants to which the Call Notice does not pertain will be unaffected by such Call Notice. In furtherance thereof, the Company
covenants and agrees that it will honor all Elections to Purchase with respect to Warrants subject to a Call Notice that are tendered
through 6:30 PM (Eastern Time) on the Call Date. The parties agree that any Election to Purchase delivered following a Call Notice
which calls less than all the Warrants shall first reduce to zero the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of
the Warrants subject to such Call Notice prior to reducing the remaining shares of Common Stock available for purchase under the
Warrants. For example, if (A) certain Warrants then permit the Registered Holder to purchase 100 shares of Common Stock, (B) a
Call Notice pertains to 75 shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants, and (C) prior to 6:30 PM (Eastern
Time) on the Call Date the Registered Holder tenders an Election to Purchase in respect of 50 shares of Common Stock, then (x) on
the Call Date the right under the Warrants to purchase 25 shares of Common Stock will be automatically cancelled, (y) the
Company, in the time and manner required under this Warrant Agreement, will have issued and delivered to the Registered Holder
50 shares of Common Stock in respect of the exercises following receipt of the Call Notice, and (z) the Holder may, until
the Termination Date, exercise the Warrants for 25 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as herein provided and subject
to subsequent Call Notices). Subject again to the provisions of this  Section 3.5 , the Company may deliver subsequent
Call Notices for any portion of the Warrants for which the Holder shall not have delivered an Election to Purchase. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Warrants, the Company may not deliver a Call Notice or require the cancellation of the
Warrants (and any such Call Notice shall be void), unless, from the beginning of the Measurement Period through the Call Date,
(1) the Company shall have honored in accordance with the terms of the Warrants all Elections to Purchase delivered by 6:30
PM (Eastern Time) on the Call Date, (2) the Common Stock shall be listed or quoted for trading on a principal securities exchange
or trading market, and (3) there is a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock for issuance of all shares of
Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants. The Company s right to call the Warrants under this  Section 3.5 
shall be exercised ratably among the Registered Holders. 

4.             Adjustments . 

4.1.          Stock
Dividends . 

4.1.1.           Split
Ups . If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of  Section 4.4 , the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in Common Stock, or by a split-up of Common Stock or other similar event,
then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on
exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Common Stock and the Exercise
Price shall be proportionally decreased such that the aggregate Exercise Price, after such adjustments, remains the same for each
Warrant. 

4.1.2.           Dividends
and Other Distributions . If the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to
acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution
of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement,
scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction), except to the extent an adjustment was already made pursuant to  Section 4.1.1 
or  4.2  (a   Distribution  ), at any time after the issuance of a Warrant, then, in each such case, the
Company shall reserve and put aside the maximum Distribution amount the Holder would have been entitled to receive if the Holder
had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of the Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date on which a record is taken
for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for the participation in such Distribution. Upon exercise of a Warrant, in whole or in part, the Company shall, contemporaneously
with the delivery of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, distribute to the Holder a pro rata portion of such
Distribution based on the portion of the Warrant that has been exercised ( provided ,  however , to the extent that the
Holder s right to participate in any such Distributions would result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then
the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution at such time and to such extent (or the beneficial ownership
of any such Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and such Distribution to such extent shall be held in
abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding
the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or
made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution to be held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if
there had been no such limitation). 

4.2.           Aggregation
of Shares . If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of  Section 4.5 , the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of Common Stock or other
similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar
event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease
in outstanding shares of Common Stock and the Exercise Price shall be proportionally increased such that the aggregate Exercise
Price, after such adjustments, remains the same for each Warrant. 

4.3.           Subsequent
Rights Offerings . In addition to any adjustments stated herein, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common
Stock equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all the record holders of any
class of shares of Common Stock (the   Purchase Rights  ), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on exercise hereof, including without limitation on the Maximum Percentage immediately before the date on which a record is taken
for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders
of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights ( provided ,  however ,
to the extent that the Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the
Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall
be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the
Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold
on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent Purchase Right to be held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there
had been no such limitation). 

4.4.           Fundamental
Transactions . If, at any time while the Warrants are outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more
related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another person, (ii) the Company, directly
or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer
or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted
to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or
more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects
any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which
the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (v) the Company, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination
(including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another person or group
of persons whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any
shares of Common Stock held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other
persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental
Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent exercise of a Warrant, the Holder of each Warrant shall have the right to receive,
for each share of Common Stock that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental
Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in  Section 3.4  on the exercise of the Warrants),
the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation,
and any additional consideration (the   Alternate Consideration  ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental
Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which a Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental
Transaction (without regard to any limitation in  Section 3.4  on the exercise of the Warrants). For purposes of any
such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration
based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental
Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the   Successor Entity  ) and for which stockholders of
the Company received any equity securities of the Successor Entity to assume in writing all obligations of the Company under each
Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this  Section 4.3  pursuant to agreements in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders holding Warrants to purchase at least a majority of the shares of Common
Stock underlying the then outstanding Warrants (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at
the option of each Holder, deliver to such Holder in exchange for such Holder s Warrant a security of the Successor Entity
evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to such Holder s Warrant which is exercisable
for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares
of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of such Warrant (without regard to the limitations on exercise set forth
in  Section 3.4 ) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the Exercise Price
hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to
such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise
price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of such Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental
Transaction). Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted
for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Agreement and each Warrant referring
to the   Company   shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the
Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement and each Warrant with the same effect as if
such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. 

4.5.           Calculations .
All calculations under this  Section 4  shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest whole share, as the case may
be. For purposes of this  Section 4 , any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and
outstanding as of a given date shall not include treasury shares, if any. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 4 ,
no adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
1% in such price;  provided ,  however , that any adjustments which by reason of the immediately preceding sentence are
not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. In any case in which this
 Section 4  shall require that an adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified
event, if the Registered Holder exercises a Warrant after such record date, the Company may elect to defer, until the occurrence
of such event, the issuance of the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company in excess of the shares of Common
Stock and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise Price in effect
prior to such adjustment;  provided ,  however , that in such case the Company or the Warrant Agent shall deliver to
the Registered Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing the Registered Holder s right to receive such
additional shares and/or other capital securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. 

4.6.           Notices
of Changes in Warrant . Upon every adjustment of the Exercise Price or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant,
the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent, which notice shall state the Exercise Price resulting from
such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a
Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. Upon
the occurrence of any event specified in  Sections 4.1 ,  4.2  or  4.3 , the Company shall give written notice of
the occurrence of such event to each Warrant holder, at the last address set forth for such holder in the Warrant Register, of
the record date or the effective date of the event. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality
or validity of such event. 

4.7.           No
Fractional Shares . Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional
shares upon exercise of Warrants. If, by reason of any adjustment made pursuant to this  Section 4 , the holder of any
Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall, upon
such exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such Holder. If fewer
than all the Warrants evidenced by a Book-Entry Warrant are exercised, a notation shall be made to the records maintained by the
Depository, its nominee for each Book-Entry Warrant, or a Participant, as appropriate, evidencing the balance of the Warrants remaining
after such exercise. 

4.8.           Form of
Warrant . The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this  Section 4 , and Warrants
issued after such adjustment may state the same Exercise Price and the same number of shares as is stated in the Warrants initially
issued pursuant to this Agreement. 

5.             Transfer
and Exchange of Warrants . 

5.1.           Registration
of Transfer . The Warrant Agent shall register the transfer, from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant
Register, upon surrender of such Warrant for transfer, properly endorsed with signatures properly guaranteed and accompanied by
appropriate instructions for transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants
shall be issued and the old Warrant shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. The Warrants so cancelled shall be delivered by the
Warrant Agent to the Company from time to time upon request. 

5.2.           Procedure
for Surrender of Warrants . Warrants may be surrendered to the Warrant Agent, together with a written request for exchange or
transfer, duly executed by the Registered Holder thereof, or by a duly authorized attorney, and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall
issue in exchange therefor one or more new Warrants as requested by the Registered Holder of the Warrants so surrendered, representing
an equal aggregate number of Warrants;  provided ,  however , that except as otherwise provided herein or in any Book-Entry
Warrant, each Book-Entry Warrant may be transferred only in whole and only to the Depository, to another nominee of the Depository,
to a successor depository, or to a nominee of a successor depository. 

5.3.           Fractional
Warrants . The Warrant Agent shall not be required to effect any registration of transfer or exchange which shall result in
the issuance of a Book-Entry Warrant or Warrant Certificate for a fraction of a Warrant. 

5.4.           Warrant
Execution and Countersignature . The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued pursuant to the provisions of this  Section 5 . 

6.             Other
Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants . 

6.1.           No
Rights as Stockholder . Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, a Registered Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder
of a Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of share capital of the Company for any
purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Agreement be construed to confer upon a Registered Holder, solely in its capacity
as the Registered Holder of a Warrant, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold
consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger,
conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance
to the Registered Holder of the shares of Common Stock which it is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of a Warrant.
A Warrant does not entitle the Registered Holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder. 

6.2.           Lost,
Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants . If any Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company or the Warrant
Agent may require the Holder to furnish a bond of indemnity and/or an affidavit of loss in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent
and the Company before issuing a new Warrant to the Holder. Subject to the preceding sentence, and any other condition which the
Warrant Agent or the Company may otherwise impose at their discretion (which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include
the surrender thereof), the Company and the Warrant Agent may issue a new Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date as the
Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall constitute a substitute contractual obligation of
the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at any time enforceable by anyone. 

6.3.          Reservation
of Common Stock . The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock that shall be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement. 

7.             Concerning
the Warrant Agent and Other Matters . 

7.1.          Payment
of Taxes . The Company shall from time to time promptly pay all taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company or the
Warrant Agent in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Warrants, but the Company
shall not be obligated to pay any income taxes of the Holder in respect of the Warrants or such shares. 

7.2.          Resignation,
Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent . 

7.2.1.           Appointment
of Successor Warrant Agent . The Warrant Agent, or any successor hereafter appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged
from all further duties and liabilities hereunder after giving thirty (30) days  notice in writing to the Company. If the
office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint in writing
a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of
thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder
of a Warrant (who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Warrant may
apply for the appointment of a successor Warrant Agent at the Company s cost. Any successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed
by the Company or by such court, shall be a corporation in good standing in the State of _______ and having its principal office
in the City and State of _______, and authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision
or examination by federal or state authority. After appointment, any successor Warrant Agent shall be vested with all the authority,
powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations of its predecessor Warrant Agent with like effect as if originally named as
the Warrant Agent hereunder, without any further act or deed; but if for any reason it becomes necessary or appropriate, the predecessor
Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the Company, an instrument transferring to such successor Warrant Agent
all the authority, powers, and rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent hereunder; and upon request of any successor Warrant Agent
the Company shall make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all instruments in writing for more fully and effectually vesting
in and confirming to such successor Warrant Agent all such authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations. 

7.2.2.           Notice
of Successor Warrant Agent . In the event a successor Warrant Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give notice thereof
to the predecessor Warrant Agent and the transfer agent for the Common Stock not later than the effective date of any such appointment. 

7.2.3.           Merger
or Consolidation of Warrant Agent . Any company into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated
or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party shall be the successor
Warrant Agent under this Agreement without any further act. 

7.3.          Fees
and Expenses of Warrant Agent . The Company will pay or cause to be paid to the Warrant Agent fees for the Warrant Agent s
services hereunder as set forth in  Exhibit B  attached hereto, in each case payable upon the Warrant Agent s invoice
to the Company. The Company agrees to pay the Warrant Agent any transfer agent fees which are in addition to the Warrant Agent
fees and shall, pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement, reimburse the Warrant Agent upon demand for all expenditures
that the Warrant Agent may reasonably incur in the execution of its duties hereunder. 

7.3.1.           Further
Assurances . The Company agrees to perform, execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged,
and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments, and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent for
the carrying out or performing of the provisions of this Agreement. 

7.4.          Liability
of Warrant Agent . 

7.4.1.           Reliance
on Company Statement . Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary
or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder,
such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively
proved and established by a statement signed by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or other principal
officer of the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon such statement for any action taken
or suffered in good faith by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 

7.4.2.           Indemnity .
The Company will indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Warrant Agent from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
costs, damages or expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses, incurred or made, arising
out of or in connection with the performance of the Warrant Agent s obligations under the provisions of this Agreement, including
but not limited to, acting, or refusing to act, in reliance upon any signature, endorsement, assignment, certificate, order, request,
notice, report, record, instructions or other instrument or document believed by the Warrant Agent in good faith to be valid, genuine
and sufficient;  provided ,  however , such indemnification shall not apply to any losses, liabilities, costs, damages
or expenses caused by the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent shall be under
no obligation to institute or defend any action, suit, or legal proceeding in connection herewith or to incur any expense related
to any such action, suit or legal proceeding, unless first indemnified to the Warrant Agent s satisfaction. The indemnities
provided by this paragraph shall survive the resignation or discharge of the Warrant Agent or the termination of this Agreement.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Warrant Agent or the Company be liable under
or in connection with this Agreement for indirect, special, incidental, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind
whatsoever, including but not limited to lost profits, whether or not foreseeable, even if the Warrant Agent or the Company have
been advised of the possibility thereof and regardless of the form of action in which such damages are sought. The Warrant Agent s
aggregate liability to the Company, or any of the Company s representatives or agents, under this  Section 7.4.2 
or under any other term or provision of this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is expressly limited to, and shall
not exceed in any circumstances, the fees received by the Warrant Agent as fees and charges under this Agreement, but not including
reimbursable expenses previously reimbursed to the Warrant Agent by the Company hereunder. 

7.4.3.           Exclusions .
The Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to the validity of this Agreement or with respect to the validity or
execution of any Warrant (except its countersignature thereof). The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any breach by the
Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Warrant. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible
to make any adjustments required under the provisions of  Section 4  or responsible for the manner, method, or amount
of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment; nor shall it by any
act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Warrant or as to whether any shares of Common Stock shall, when issued, be valid
and fully paid and nonassessable. 

7.5.           Acceptance
of Agency . The Warrant Agent hereby accepts the agency established by this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the
terms and conditions herein set forth and among other things, shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised

Stock through the exercise of the Warrants.

Exhibit 4.3  

XTANT MEDICAL HOLDINGS, INC.  

WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK  

Number of Shares:________ 
(subject to adjustment) 

Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the   Company  ), hereby certifies that, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, _______________ or its permitted registered assigns (the   Holder  ), is entitled,
subject to the terms set forth below, to purchase from the Company up to a total of _______ shares of common stock, $0.000001 par
value per share (the   Common Stock  ), of the Company (each such share, a   Warrant Share  
and all such shares, the   Warrant Shares  ) at an exercise price per share equal to $0.01 per share (as adjusted
from time to time as provided in  Section 9  herein, the   Exercise Price  ), upon surrender of this
warrant to purchase Common Stock (including any warrants to purchase Common Stock issued in exchange, transfer or replacement hereof,
the   Warrant  ) at any time and from time to time on or after the date hereof (the   Original Issue Date  )
and through and including 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the date that is five years following the Original Issue Date (the   Expiration
Date  ), and subject to the following terms and conditions: 

1.               Definitions .
For purposes of this Warrant, the following terms shall have the following meanings:  

(a)              Affiliate  
of any Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Person.  

(b)              Commission  
means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and any successor entity thereto.  

(c)              Closing
Sale Price   means, for any security as of any date, the last trade price for such security on the Principal Trading Market
for such security, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or, if such Principal Trading Market begins to operate on an extended
hours basis and does not designate the last trade price, then the last trade price of such security immediately prior to 4:00 P.M.,
New York City time, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or if the foregoing do not apply, the last trade price of such
security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets,
or, if no last trade price is reported for such security by Bloomberg Financial Markets, the average of the bid and ask prices,
of any market makers for such security as reported in the  pink sheets  by Pink Sheets LLC. If the Closing Sale Price
cannot be calculated for a security on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Sale Price of such security
on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Company and the Holder. If the Company and the Holder
are unable to agree upon the fair market value of such security, then the Board of Directors of the Company shall use its good
faith judgment to determine the fair market value of such security on such date. The Board of Directors  determination shall
be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error. All such determinations shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend,
stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction during the applicable calculation period.  

(d)              Person  
means any natural person, corporation, firm, joint venture, partnership, limited liability company, association, enterprise, trust
or other entity or organization, or any government or political subdivision or any agency, department or instrumentality thereof.  

(e)              Principal
Trading Market   means the trading market on which the Common Stock is primarily listed on and quoted for trading, and
which, as of the Original Issue Date shall be the NYSE MKT LLC.  

(f)              Securities
Act   means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  

(g)              Trading
Day   means a day on which the Principal Trading Market is open for trading.  

2.               Registration
of Warrants . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the   Warrant
Register  ), in the name of the record Holder (which shall include the initial Holder or, as the case may be, any registered
assignee to which this Warrant is permissibly assigned hereunder) from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder, and
for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.  

3.               Registration
of Transfers . Subject to compliance with all applicable securities laws, the Company shall register the transfer of all or
any portion of this Warrant in the Warrant Register, upon surrender of this Warrant, and payment of all applicable transfer taxes.
Upon any such registration of transfer, a new warrant to purchase Common Stock in substantially the form of this Warrant (any such
new warrant, a   New Warrant  ) evidencing the portion of this Warrant so transferred shall be issued to the transferee,
and a New Warrant evidencing the remaining portion of this Warrant not so transferred, if any, shall be issued to the transferring
Holder. The acceptance of the New Warrant by the transferee thereof shall be deemed the acceptance by such transferee of all of
the rights and obligations in respect of the New Warrant that the Holder had in respect of this Warrant. The Company shall prepare,
issue and deliver at the Company s own expense any New Warrant under this  Section 3 . Until due presentment for
registration of transfer, the Company may treat the registered Holder hereof as the owner and holder of this Warrant for all purposes,
and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.  

4.               Exercise
and Duration of Warrants .  

(a)            All
or any part of this Warrant shall be exercisable by the registered Holder in any manner permitted by this Warrant at any time and
from time to time on or after the Original Issue Date and through and including 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the Expiration Date;  provided ,
 however , that, if upon the Expiration Date, the Holder s exercise in full of this Warrant would cause the Holder s
beneficial ownership of the Common Stock to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the term of this Warrant shall be automatically extended
until, and this Warrant shall be automatically exercised on, the date that is the 90th day following the date on which this Warrant
may be exercised in full without the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage. Subject to the foregoing sentence, at 5:00 PM Eastern
Time on the Expiration Date, the portion of this Warrant not exercised prior thereto shall be void and of no value and this Warrant
shall terminate and no longer be outstanding.  

(b)            The
Holder may exercise this Warrant by delivering to the Company (i) an exercise notice, in the form attached as  Schedule
1  hereto (the   Exercise Notice  ), completed and duly signed, and (ii) payment of the Exercise Price
for the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (which may take the form of a  net share exercise 
if so indicated in the Exercise Notice pursuant to  Section 10  below), and the date on which the last of such items
is delivered to the Company (as determined in accordance with the notice provisions hereof) is an  Exercise Date. 
If held in certificated form, the Holder shall be required to deliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder.
Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance of
a New Warrant to the Holder evidencing its right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company may not substitute, and the Holder may not request, a cash payment in satisfaction of the Company s obligation
to issue and deliver Warrant Shares pursuant to an Exercise Notice.  

5.               Delivery
of Warrant Shares .  

(a)            Upon
exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after the Exercise
Date), upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant
to such exercise to the Holder s or its designee s balance account with The Depository Trust Company (  DTC  )
through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system, or if the Company s transfer agent is not participating in the Fast
Automated Securities Transfer Program (the   FAST Program  ) or if the certificates are required to bear a legend
regarding restriction on transferability, issue and dispatch by overnight courier to the address as specified in the Exercise Notice,
a certificate, registered in the Company s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares
of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise. The Holder, or any Person permissibly so designated
by the Holder to receive Warrant Shares, shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the Exercise
Date, irrespective of the date such Warrant Shares are credited to the Holder s DTC account or the date of delivery of the
certificates evidencing such Warrant Shares, as the case may be.  

(b)            To
the extent permitted by law, the Company s obligations to issue and deliver Warrant Shares in accordance with and subject
to the terms hereof (including the limitations set forth in  Section 11  below) are absolute and unconditional, irrespective
of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery
of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination,
or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged
violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance that might otherwise limit such
obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit the Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

6.               Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental tax or expense in respect
of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company;  provided ,  however ,
that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration
of any certificates for Warrant Shares or the Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder or an Affiliate thereof. The Holder
shall be responsible for all other tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or transferring this Warrant or receiving
Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof.  

7.               Replacement
of Warrant . If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange
and substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon
receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction (in such case) and, in each case,
a customary and reasonable indemnity and surety bond, if requested by the Company. Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances
shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the
Company may prescribe. If a New Warrant is requested as a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver
such mutilated Warrant to the Company as a condition precedent to the Company s obligation to issue the New Warrant.  

8.               Reservation
of Warrant Shares . The Company covenants that it will at all times while this Warrant is outstanding reserve and keep available
out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of enabling it
to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein provided, the number of Warrant Shares that are initially issuable
and deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any other contingent purchase rights of
persons other than the Holder (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of  Section 9 ). The Company covenants
that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance
with the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized and issued, and fully paid and nonassessable. The Company will take all such
action as may be reasonably necessary to assure that such shares of Common Stock may be issued as provided herein without violation
of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system upon which
the Common Stock may be listed.  

9.               Certain
Adjustments . The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment
from time to time as set forth in this  Section 9 .  

(a)             Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its
Common Stock or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides
its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares of Common Stock, (iii) combines its outstanding shares
of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of capital stock
any additional shares of Common Stock of the Company, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to
clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such dividend or distribution,  provided ,  however , that if such record date shall have been fixed
and such dividend is not fully paid on the date fixed therefor, the Exercise Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close
of business on such record date and thereafter the Exercise Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of the time of
actual payment of such dividends. Any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective
immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination.  

(b)            Pro
Rata Distributions . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, distributes to all holders of Common Stock
for no consideration (i) evidences of its indebtedness, (ii) any security (other than a distribution of Common Stock
covered by the preceding paragraph) or (iii) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security, or (iv) any
other asset (in each case,   Distributed Property  ), then, upon any exercise of this Warrant that occurs after
the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, the Holder shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to the Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon such exercise (if applicable), the Distributed Property that
such Holder would have been entitled to receive in respect of such number of Warrant Shares had the Holder been the record holder
of such Warrant Shares immediately prior to such record date without regard to any limitation on exercise contained therein.  

(c)             Fundamental
Transactions . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding (i) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of
the Company with or into another Person, in which the Company is not the surviving entity or the stockholders of the Company immediately
prior to such merger or consolidation do not own, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity
immediately after such merger or consolidation, (ii) the Company effects any sale to another Person of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person), holders of capital stock who tender shares representing more than 50% of the voting power of
the capital stock of the Company and the Company or such other Person, as applicable, accepts such tender for payment, (iv) the
Company consummates a stock purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person whereby such other Person acquires more than the 50% of
the voting power of the capital stock of the Company or (v) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or
any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock covered by  Section 9(a)  above)
(in any such case, a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then following such Fundamental Transaction the Holder shall
have the right to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would
have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental
Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant without regard to any
limitations on exercise contained herein (the   Alternate Consideration  ). The Company shall not effect any Fundamental
Transaction in which the Company is not the surviving entity or the Alternate Consideration includes securities of another Person
unless prior to or simultaneously with the consummation thereof, any successor to the Company, surviving entity or other Person
(including any purchaser of assets of the Company) shall assume the obligation to deliver to the Holder, such Alternate Consideration
as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Holder may be entitled to receive, and the other obligations under this Warrant.  

(d)             Number
of Warrant Shares . Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  Section 9 ,
the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately,
so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the increased or decreased number of Warrant Shares
shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment.  

(e)             Calculations .
All calculations under this  Section 9  shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest whole share, as the case may
be. For purposes of this  Section 9 , any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and
outstanding as of a given date shall not include treasury shares, if any. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 9 ,
no adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
1% in such price;  provided ,  however , that any adjustments which by reason of the immediately preceding sentence are
not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  

(f)             Notice
of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment pursuant to this  Section 9 , the Company at its expense will,
at the written request of the Holder, promptly compute such adjustment, in good faith, in accordance with the terms of this Warrant
and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number
or type of Warrant Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing the transactions
giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the
Company will promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder.  

(g)             Notice
of Corporate Events . If, while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company (i) declares a dividend or any other distribution
of cash, securities or other property in respect of its Common Stock, including, without limitation, any granting of rights or
warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters
into any material definitive agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii) authorizes
the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, except if such notice and the contents
thereof shall be deemed to constitute material non-public information, the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice of such
transaction at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common
Stock in order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction;  provided ,  however , that the failure to
deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such
notice. In addition, if while this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company enters into any material definitive agreement contemplating
or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction contemplated by  Section 9(c) , other than a Fundamental
Transaction under clause (iii) of  Section 9(c) , the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice of such Fundamental
Transaction at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Fundamental Transaction is consummated. To the extent that any notice
provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
the Holder shall keep such information confidential until the Company shall file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a
Current Report on Form 8-K.  

10.            Payment
of Exercise Price . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder may, in its sole discretion, satisfy
its obligation to pay the Exercise Price through a  net share exercise , in which event the Company shall issue to
the Holder the number of Warrant Shares determined as follows:  

X = Y [(A-B)/A] 

where: 

X   
       
      equals the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder;   
 
       Y   
       
      equals the total number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised;   
 
       A   
       
      equals the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the shares of Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days ending on the date immediately preceding the Exercise Date; and   
 
       B   
       
      equals the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrant Shares at the time of such exercise.   

For purposes of Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a  cashless
exercise  transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares
shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued ( provided  that the Commission continues
to take the position that such treatment is proper at the time of such exercise). 

11.            Limitations
on Exercise . The Company shall not affect the exercise of any portion of this Warrant, and the Holder shall not have the right
to exercise any portion of this Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the Holder (together with the
Holder s Affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any Holder s Affiliates) would beneficially
own in excess of 4.99% (the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect
to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by
the Holder and its Affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with the Holder and the Holder s Affiliates, shall
include the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude
Warrant Shares which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder and its Affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with the Holder and the Holder s Affiliates,
and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially
owned by the Holder and its Affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with the Holder and the Holder s Affiliates
(including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph,
beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the   Exchange Act  ). The Company shall not be responsible for calculating beneficial ownership in accordance
with the provisions of this  Section 11 . To the extent that the limitation contained in this  Section 11 
applies, the Holder s submission of an Exercise Notice shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether
this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to any other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates, and any persons
acting as a group together with the Holder and the Holder s Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable,
in each case subject to the Maximum Percentage, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such
determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Warrant,
in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in the most recent of (1) the Company s most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Current Report
on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission, as the case may be, (2) a more recent written public announcement
by the Company, or (3) any other notice by the Company or its transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within three (3) Trading
Days confirm to the Registered Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
this Warrant, by the Holder and its Affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with the Holder and the Holder s
Affiliates, since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the
Company, the Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant and the
provisions of this  Section 11  shall continue to apply;  provided  that (y) any such increase will not be
effective until the [sixty-first (61st)] day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (z) any such increase or decrease
will apply only to the Holder. For purposes of clarity, the Common Stock underlying this Warrant in excess of the Maximum Percentage
for the Holder shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by that Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or
Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The provisions set forth herein shall be construed and implemented in a manner
otherwise than in strict conformity with the other terms of this  Section 11  to the extent necessary to correct any
such provision which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to
make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.  

12.            No
Fractional Shares . No fractional Warrant Shares will be issued in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of
any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable, the number of Warrant Shares to be issued shall be rounded down to the
next whole number.  

13.            Notices .
Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries hereunder (including, without limitation, any Exercise Notice) shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication
is delivered via facsimile or confirmed e-mail at the facsimile number or e-mail address specified in the books and records of
the Company prior to 5:00 PM Eastern Time on a Trading Day, (ii) the next Trading Day after the date of transmission, if such
notice or communication is delivered via facsimile or confirmed e-mail at the facsimile number or e-mail address specified in the
