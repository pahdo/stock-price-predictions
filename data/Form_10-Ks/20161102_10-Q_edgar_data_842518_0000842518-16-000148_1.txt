ITEM 1   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

EVANS BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

THREE   AND NINE   MONTH   PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30  ,   2016 AND 2015 

1.   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The accounting and reporting policies followed by Evans Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ), a financial holding company, and its   two   direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Evans Bank, National Association (the  Bank ), and the Bank s subsidiaries, Evans National Leasing, Inc. ( ENL ), Evans National Holding Corp. ( ENHC ) and Suchak Data Systems, LLC ( SDS ); and (ii) Evans National Financial Services, LLC ( ENFS ), and ENFS s subsidiary, The Evans Agency, LLC ( TEA ), and TEA s subsidiaries, Frontier Claims Services, Inc. ( FCS ) and ENB Associates Inc. ( ENBA ), in the preparation of the accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and with general practice within the industries in which it operates.  Except as the context otherwise requires, the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the  Company.  

The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 10-K ).  The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the 10-K. 

An accounting policy not discussed in Note 1 to the 10-K is the accounting for rehabilitation of historic properties tax credit investments.  In the typical structure of these transactions, the Bank will invest in a partnership that is incurring expenses related to the rehabilitation of a certified historic structure located in New York State.  At the time the historic structure is placed in service, the Bank is eligible for a federal and New York State tax credit.  At the same time, the Bank evaluates its investment, which is valued at the present value of the expected cash flows from its partnership interest.  If the investment is determined to be impaired, the Bank will record that impairment loss on its income statement in non-interest income.  The federal tax credit impact is included in the Company s estimated effective tax rate calculation and recorded in income tax expense.  For New York State, any new credit earned from rehabilitated historic properties placed in service on or after January 1, 2015, not used in the current tax year will be treated as a refund or overpayment of tax to be credited to the next year s tax.  Since the   realization of the tax credit does not depend on the Bank s generation of future taxable income or the Bank s ongoing tax status or tax position, the refund is not considered an element of income tax accounting (ASC 740).  In such cases, the Bank would not record the credit as a reduction of income tax expense; rather, the Bank includes the refundable New York State tax credit in non-interest income.

2.   SECURITIES 

The amortized cost of securities and their approximate fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

Available for sale securities with a total fair value of   $88   million and   $86   million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.

Table of Contents  

The Company uses the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLBNY ) as its primary source of overnight funds and also has several long-term advances with FHLBNY.  The Company had $51 million and $10 million in borrowed funds at FHLBNY at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company has pledged sufficient collateral in the form of residential and commercial real estate loans at FHLBNY that meets FHLB collateral requirements.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) System, the Bank is required to hold stock in FHLBNY.  The Bank held $3 million and $1 million in FHLBNY stock at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company regularly evaluates investments in FHLBNY for impairment, considering liquidity, operating performance, capital position, stock repurchase and dividend history.  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s investment in FHLBNY stock was   not   impaired. 

The Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) system, is currently required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FRB in an amount equal to   6%   of its capital and surplus.  The Bank s investment in FRB capital stock totaled $1.5 million at each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Based on the current capital adequacy and liquidity position of the FRB, management believes there is   no   impairment in the Company s investment at September 30, 2016 and the cost of the investment approximates fair value. 

The scheduled maturities of debt and mortgage-backed securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below.  All maturity amounts are contractual maturities.  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call premiums. 

While the contractual maturities of our mortgage-backed securities generally exceed   ten   years, the Company expects the effective lives to be significantly shorter due to prepayments of the underlying loans and the nature of these securities.  The duration of the investment securities portfolio decreased from   4.0   years at December 31, 2015 to   3.9   years at September 30, 2016. 

Information regarding unrealized losses within the Company s available for sale securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized below.  The securities are primarily U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities or municipal securities.  All unrealized losses are considered temporary and are related to market interest rate fluctuations.

Management has assessed the securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and determined the decline in fair value below amortized cost to be temporary.  In making this determination, management considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, the percentage decline in comparison to the securities  amortized cost, and the financial condition of the issuer (primarily government or government-sponsored enterprises).  In addition, management does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost.  Management believes the decline in fair value is primarily related to market interest rate fluctuations and not to the credit deterioration of the individual issuers. 

The Company has   not   recorded any other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) charges as of September 30, 2016 and did   not   record any OTTI charges during 2015.  Nevertheless, it remains possible that there could be deterioration in the asset quality of the securities portfolio in the future.  The credit worthiness of the Company s portfolio is largely reliant on the ability of U.S. government sponsored agencies such as FHLB, Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ), Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), and municipalities throughout New York State to meet their obligations.  In addition, dysfunctional markets could materially alter the liquidity, interest rate, and pricing risk of the portfolio.  The relatively stable past performance is not a guarantee for similar performance of the Company s securities portfolio in future periods. 

3.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements.   Those provisions relate to financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities.  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

There are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements: 

Level 1, meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;     

Level 2, meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable; and     

Level 3, meaning the use of unobservable inputs.     

Observable market data should be used when available. 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS 

The following table presents, for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels as defined in this footnote, those financial instruments which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively: 

13   

Table of Contents  

Securities available for sale 

Fair values for securities are determined using independent pricing services and market-participating brokers.  The Company s independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data.  Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the evaluated pricing applications apply information as applicable through processes, such as benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations.  In addition, model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios.  The models and the process take into account market convention.  For each asset class, a team of evaluators gathers information from market sources and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models.  The company s service provider may occasionally determine that it does not have sufficient verifiable information to value a particular security.  In these cases the Company will utilize valuations from another pricing service. 

Management believes that it has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of securities to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.  On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews changes in the market value of its security portfolio.  Individual changes in valuations are reviewed for consistency with general interest rate movements and any known credit concerns for specific securities.  Additionally, on an annual basis, the Company has its entire security portfolio priced by a second pricing service to determine consistency with another market evaluator.  If, during the Company s review or when comparing with another servicer, a material difference between pricing evaluations were to exist, the Company would submit an inquiry to the service provider regarding the data used to value a particular security.  If the Company determines it has market information that would support a different valuation than the initial evaluation it can submit a challenge for a change to that security s valuation. 

Securities available for sale are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation provided by the third-party provider uses observable market data. 

Mortgage servicing rights 

Mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices.  Accordingly, the Company obtains the fair value of the MSRs using a third-party pricing provider.  The provider determines the fair value by discounting projected net servicing cash flows of the remaining servicing portfolio.  The valuation model used by the provider considers market loan prepayment predictions and other economic factors which management considers to be significant unobservable inputs.  The fair value of MSRs is mostly affected by changes in mortgage interest rates since rate changes cause the loan prepayment acceleration factors to increase or decrease.  Management has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.  Mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuation is model driven and primarily based on unobservable inputs. 

The following table summarizes the changes in fair value for mortgage servicing rights during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

Table of Contents  

Quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of MSRs at the respective dates is as follows: 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS 

The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the carrying value of certain assets or provide valuation allowances related to certain assets using fair value measurements.  The following table presents for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels as defined in this footnote, those financial instruments which are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Collateral dependent impaired loans 

The Company evaluates     and values impaired loans at the time the loan is identified as impaired, and the fair values of such loans are estimated using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.  Each loan s collateral has a unique appraisal and management s discount of the value is based on factors unique to each impaired loan.  The significant unobservable input in determining the fair value is management s subjective discount on appraisals of the collateral securing the loan, which ranges from   10%  -  50%  .  Collateral may consist of real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable and the value of these assets is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Company.  Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, estimated costs to sell, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the client and the client s business. 

15   

Table of Contents  

The Company has an appraisal policy in which appraisals are obtained upon a commercial loan being downgraded on the Company internal loan rating scale to a 5 (special mention) or a 6 (substandard) depending on the amount of the loan, the type of loan and the type of collateral.  All impaired commercial loans are either graded a 6 or 7 on the internal loan rating scale.  For consumer loans, the Company obtains appraisals when a loan becomes   90   days past due or is determined to be impaired, whichever occurs first.  Subsequent to the downgrade or reaching 90 days past due, if the loan remains outstanding and impaired for at least one year more, management may require another follow-up appraisal.  Between receipts of updated appraisals, if necessary, management may perform an internal valuation based on any known changing conditions in the marketplace such as sales of similar properties, a change in the condition of the collateral, or feedback from local appraisers.  Impaired loans had a gross value of $18.3 million, with a allowance for loan loss of $1.9 million, at September 30, 2016 compared with $19.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

At each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, including those that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis, were as follows: 

16   

Table of Contents  

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate that value. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  .  For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.   Cash and Cash Equivalents  includes interest-bearing deposits at other banks. 

FHLB and FRB stock.    The carrying value of FHLB and FRB stock, which are non-marketable equity investments, approximate fair value. 

Securities held to maturity.    The Company holds certain municipal bonds as held-to-maturity.  These bonds are generally small in dollar amount and are issued only by certain local municipalities within the Company s market area.  The original terms are negotiated directly and on an individual basis consistent with our loan and credit guidelines.  These bonds are not traded on the open market and management intends to hold the bonds to maturity.  The fair value of held-to-maturity securities is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar agreements would be made with municipalities with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. 

Loans and Leases, net  .  The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, net of the appropriate portion of the allowance for loan losses.  For variable rate loans, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  This fair value calculation is not necessarily indicative of the exit price, as defined in ASC 820. 

Deposits  .  The fair value of demand deposits, NOW accounts, muni-vest accounts and regular savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  The fair value of time deposits is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures  .  There is no active market for the Company s debentures and there have been no issuances of similar instruments in recent years.  The Company looked at a market bond index to estimate a discount margin to value the debentures.  The discount margin was very similar to the spread to LIBOR established at the issuance of the debentures.  As a result, the Company determined that the fair value of the adjustable-rate debentures approximates their face amount. 

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase.    The fair value of the securities sold under agreement to repurchase approximates its carrying value as the repurchase agreements are one day agreements. 

Other Borrowed Funds.        The fair value of the short-term portion of other borrowed funds approximates its carrying value.  The fair value of the long-term portion of other borrowed funds is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

4.   LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

Loan Portfolio Composition 

The following table presents selected information on the composition of the Company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

The Bank sells certain fixed rate residential mortgages to FNMA while maintaining the servicing rights for those mortgages.    In the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Bank sold mortgages to FNMA totaling   $  1.7   million, as compared with   $3.3   million in mortgages sold to FNMA in the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank sold   $5.2   million   and   $  12.9   million, respectively, to FNMA.    At September 30, 2016, the Bank had a loan servicing portfolio principal balance of   $76   million upon which it earns servicing fees, as compared with   $77   million at December 31, 2015.    The value of the mortgage servicing rights for that portfolio was   $0.  5   million at September 30, 2016 and   $0.6   million at December 31, 2015.  At September 30, 2016 there were   $2.5   million in residential mortgages held for sale compared with   $0.5   million at December 31, 2015.  The Company had   no   commercial loans held-for-sale at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  The Company has never been contacted by FNMA to repurchase any loans due to improper documentation or fraud. 

As noted in   Note 1, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Disclosures related to the basis for accounting for loans, the method for recognizing interest income on loans, the policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status and the subsequent recording of payments and resuming accrual of interest, the policy for determining past due status, a description of the Company s accounting policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, the policy for charging-off loans, the accounting policies for impaired loans, and more descriptive information on the Company s credit risk ratings are all contained in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Unless otherwise noted in this Form 10-Q, the policies and methodology described in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 are consistent with those utilized by the Company in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.

Table of Contents  

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Bank monitors the credit risk in its loan portfolio by reviewing certain credit quality indicators ( CQI ).  The primary CQI for its commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial ( C I ) portfolios is the individual loan s credit risk rating.  The following list provides a description of the credit risk ratings that are used internally by the Bank when assessing the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses: 

5-O.A.E.M. (Other Assets Especially Mentioned) or Special Mention     

6-Substandard     

The Company s consumer loans, including residential mortgages and home equities, are not individually risk rated or reviewed in the Company s loan review process.  Unlike commercial customers, consumer loan customers are not required to provide the Company with updated financial information.  Consumer loans also carry smaller balances.  Given the lack of updated information after the initial underwriting of the loan and small size of individual loans, the Company uses delinquency status as the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans.  However, once a consumer loan is identified as impaired, it is individually evaluated for impairment. 

The following tables provide data, at the class level, of credit quality indicators of certain loans for the dates specified:

Troubled debt restructurings 

The Company had $5.1 million and $5.8 million in loans that were restructured in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Of those balances, $1.2 million and $1.8 million were in non-accrual status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Any TDR that is placed on non-accrual is not reverted back to accruing status until the borrower makes timely payments as contracted for at least   six   months and future collection under the revised terms is probable.  All of the Company s restructurings were allowed in an effort to maximize its ability to collect on loans where borrowers were experiencing financial difficulty. 

The reserve for a TDR is based upon the present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective rate or upon the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, if the loan is deemed collateral dependent.  This reserve methodology is used because all TDR loans are considered impaired.  As of September 30, 2016, there were   no   commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing on loans whose terms have been modified in TDRs. 

The following tables summarize the loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings as of the dates indicated: 

The Company s TDRs have various agreements that involve deferral of principal payments, or interest-only payments, for a period (usually 12 months or less) to allow the customer time to improve cash flow or sell the property.  Other common types of concessions leading to the designation of a TDR are lines of credit that are termed out and extensions of maturities at rates that are less than the prevailing market given the risk profile of the borrower.

The general practice of the Bank is to work with borrowers so that they are able to pay back their loan in full.  If a borrower continues to be delinquent or cannot meet the terms of a TDR and the loan is determined to be uncollectible, the loan will be charged-off.  The following table presents loans which were classified as TDRs during the previous 12 months which defaulted during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

5.   PER SHARE DATA 

The common stock per share information is based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period.  For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an average of   75,355   and   67,136   dilutive shares outstanding, respectively.  The Company had an average of   71,119   and   74,331   dilutive shares outstanding for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be anti-dilutive and not included in calculating diluted earnings per share.  For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, there were   no   anti-dilutive shares outstanding.  For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, there were   37,800   and   38,077   potentially anti-dilutive shares outstanding, respectively, that were not included in calculating diluted earnings per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.

8.   CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities, which arise in the normal course of business, and which involve elements of credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.  These commitments and contingent liabilities consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  A summary of the Bank s commitments and contingent liabilities is as follows: 

35   

Table of Contents  

Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit include some exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer.  The Bank s credit policies and procedures for credit commitments and financial guarantees are the same as those for extensions of credit that are recorded on the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheets.  Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because they may expire without being drawn upon, they do not necessarily represent cash requirements of the Bank.  The Bank did   not   incur any losses on its commitments and did not record a reserve for its commitments during the first nine months of 2016 or during 2015. 

Certain lending commitments for construction residential mortgage loans are considered derivative instruments under the guidelines of GAAP.  The changes in the fair value of these commitments, due to interest rate risk, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as the fair value of these derivatives is not considered to be material. 

9.   NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS 

On January 31, 2008, the Bank froze its defined benefit pension plan.  The plan covered substantially all Bank employees.  The plan provides benefits that are based on the employees  compensation and years of service.  Under the freeze, eligible employees will receive, at retirement, the benefits already earned through January 31, 2008, but have not accrued any additional benefits since then.  As a result, service cost is no longer incurred. 

The Bank uses an actuarial method of amortizing prior service cost and unrecognized net gains or losses which result from actual expense and assumptions being different than those that are projected.  The amortization method the Bank used recognized the prior service cost and net gains or losses over the average remaining service period of active employees. 

The Bank also maintains a nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan covering certain members of the Company s senior management.  The Bank uses an actuarial method of amortizing unrecognized net gains or losses which result from actual expense and assumptions being different than those that are projected.  The amortization method the Bank uses recognizes the net gains or losses over the average remaining service period of active employees. 

The Bank contributed   $140   thousand to the defined benefit pension plan in the first nine months of 2016.

10.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    The objective of this ASU is to require entities to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its ongoing financial reporting. 

ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    The main objective of this ASU is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The ASU will not impact results of operations or the financial position of the Company, but will impact its fair value disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. 

ASU 2016-02,   Leases  .    The objective of this ASU is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements to meet that objective.  The main difference between previous GAAP and this ASU is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.  Under this new guidance, a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous GAAP.  Information about the Company s operating lease obligations is disclosed in Note 16 to the Company s Financial Statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its financial reporting. 

ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This ASU is part of the FASB s Simplification Initiative.  The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  Some of the areas of simplification apply only to nonpublic entities.  Although the impact on the Company s financial statements is not expected to be material, the area of this ASU that will impact the Company is the elimination of the concept of a tax windfall pool.  Currently, an entity must determine for each award whether the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes results in either an excess benefit or a tax deficiency.  Excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in-capital; tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or in the income statement.  Excess tax benefits are not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes payable.  Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. 

ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  Current GAAP require an  incurred loss  methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Both financial institutions and users of their financial statements expressed concern that current GAAP restricts the ability to record credit losses that are expected, but do not yet meet the  probable  threshold.  The main objective of this ASU (commonly known as the Current Expected Credit Loss Impairment Model, or CECL, in the industry) is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  To achieve this objective, the amendments in CECL replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  The amendments in CECL are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Board expects that an entity will be able to leverage its current systems and methods for recording the allowance for credit losses.  However, many financial institutions, particularly community banks similar in size to the Company and industry groups like the American Bankers Association, have expressed concern about the impact of CECL.  The life of loan loss concept presents complexities that can decrease capital, and add both volatility to ALLL estimates and additional costs.  CECL may increase the ALLL, though many factors will determine the impact for each bank.  Changes in expectations of future economic conditions play a large role in CECL and can significantly affect the credit loss estimate.  While OCC estimates made in 2012 projected a 30% to 50% increase in the ALLL, more recent bank analyst projections were far lower.  A challenge for the Company could be the operational impact.  Costly new systems and process to track loan performance may need to be purchased or developed.  Significant procedural challenges may be faced both in implementation and on an ongoing basis.  The total impact of CECL to the Company s financial statements is unknown but may be material.  Implementation of CECL will be a significant project for the Company through the projected implementation of January 1, 2020.

I    TEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

T  h  is Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  When used in this report, or in the documents incorporated by reference herein, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,   seek,  and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the Company s business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies, statements regarding the asset quality of the Company s loan and investment portfolios, and estimates of the Company s risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based largely on the expectations of the Company s management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to  :   general economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company s market areas, that are worse than expected; increased competition among depository or other financial institutions; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce the Company s margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments; changes in laws or government regulations affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, monetary policy, and capital requirements; the Company s ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; the Company s ability to successfully integrate acquired entities; changes in accounting pronouncements and practices, as adopted by financial institution regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;   changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities;   changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; changes in the Company s organization, compensation and benefit plans; and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as in the Company s periodic reports filed with the SEC, in particular the  Risk Factors  discussed in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201  5  .  Many of these factors are beyond the Company s control   and are difficult to predict. 

Because of these and other uncertainties, the Company s actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information, whether as a result of new, updated information, future events or otherwise. 

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates.  Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions  ,   and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.  These estimates, assumptions  ,   and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accordingly, as this information changes, the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions  ,   and judgments.  Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions  ,   and judgments, and as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.  Estimates, assumptions  ,   and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event.  Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility.  The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.  When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.  Refer to Note 3    Fair Value Measurements  to the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further detail on fair value measurement. 

Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1    Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  .  These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other Notes to the Company's Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are presented in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and ho  w those values are determined.

Table of Contents  

Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions  ,   and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and  ,   as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses in the Company s loan portfolio.  Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment on the part of management and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  ,   and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.  The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5   describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. 

Goodwill 

The amount of goodwill reflected in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements is required to be tested by management for impairment on at least an annual basis.  The test for impairment of goodwill on the identified reporting unit is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires judgment on the part of management and the use of estimates related to the growth assumptions and market multiples used in the   valuation model.  The goodwill   impairment testing is   performed annually as of   December 31  st  .    No impairment charges were incurred in the most recent test and the fair value of the tested reporting unit substantially exceeded its fair value.  There were no triggering events in the   nine   month period ended   September   30, 2016   that resulted in an interim impairment test. 

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Loan Activity 

Total loans grew to $  913   million at   September   30, 2016, a $  60   million or   7%   increase from total loans of $  853 million at June    3  0  , 2016 and   a    $  139   million or   18  % increase from $774 million at December 31, 2015. 

Loans secured by real estate were $  723 million at September   30, 2016, reflecting a $  51 million or 8% increase from $672   million   at June    3  0  , 2016 and a $  96   million or   15  % increase from $627 million at December 31, 2015.  Commercial and multi-family real estate loans were $  462 million at September   30, 2016, $  36 million higher than $42  6 million at   June    3  0  , 2016.  The portfolio was $400 million at the previous year-end.  Commercial construction loans also experienced strong growth  , and were up     37  % or $  23   million during   the first nine months of   2016 to $  84   million at   September   30, 2016  , including $11 million of growth in the third quarter of 2016  .  The Company s footprint in Western New York has continued to experience strong commercial real estate and commercial construction loan demand. 

In the thir  d quarter of 2016, residential mortgage originations of $  10   million were   equal to   the previous quarter s originations of $  10   million and   higher than   the   $9 million in last year s thir  d quarter.  Residential mortgages sold in   the thir  d quarter of   2016 equated to approximately 17  % of the residential mortgages originated by the Company during t  his quarter, as compared with 25  % of residential mortg  ages originated during the second   quarter of 2016 and   37  % i  n the third   quarter of 2015.  The Company originated $  25   million in reside  ntial mortgages in the first nine   months of 2016 and sold   20  % of those loans, compared with $  26   million and   50  %, respectively, in   the first nine months of   2015.  The Company retained more of the mortgage  s it originated during the first nine months of   2016 compared with the prior year   period   as a way to diversify its   balance sheet  . 

The Company has also focused on growth opportunities in commercial and industrial ( C I ) lending as a way to diversify its overall loan portfolio.  The C I portfolio grew to $  187 million at September   30, 2016, representing a  n    $  8   million or   4  % increase from $179 million at June    3  0  , 2016 and $  43   million or   30  % higher than the $144 million balance at December 31, 2015. 

Credit Quality of Loan Portfolio 

Total non-performing loans, defined as accruing loans greater than 90 days past due and   nonaccrual loans, totaled $15 million, or 1.67% of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2016, compared with $16   million,   or 1.88%   of total loans outstanding, as of   June 30, 2016 and $16 million, or 2.07  % of total loans outs  tanding, as of December 31, 2015.    The $  1   million   de  crease in   non-performing loans   as compared to     the previous quarter-end   was due to   a decrease in loans 90 days past due and accruing.  The balance in nonaccrual loans was largely unchanged in the quarter as the amount of loans that moved to nonaccrual was offset by nonaccrual loans

that paid off or returned to accruing status.  The percentage of non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans has also decreased because of the Company s loan growth throughout 2016. 

Total past due loans (inclusive of nonaccrual loans) increased from $6 million at December 31, 2015 and $22 million at June 30, 2016 to $25 million at September 30, 2016.  Past due C I loans increased from less than $1 million at the prior year-end to $5 million at June 30, 2016 and $13 million at September 30, 2016.  Most of the increase is attributable to two loan relationships.  One relationship, for $6 million, was 30 days past its maturity date at September 30, 2016, but subsequently paid off in the fourth quarter.  The second relationship, for $3 million, made two payments in the first month of the fourth quarter to go back to a current status.  Past due commercial construction loans were $4 million at September 30, 2016, down from $9 million at the previous quarter end, but increased from zero at the end of 2015.  The $4 million balance in past due commercial construction loans at September 30, 2016 is comprised of a single relationship which was in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2015, but was not past due.  The loan remains in nonaccrual status as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. 

C  ommercial credits graded as  special mention  and  substandard  ,      or the criticized loan portfolio, was $41 million at September 30, 2016, a $6 million increase from   $  35   mil  lion at June 30, 2016, but approximately equal to the $41 million in criticized loans at December 31, 2015.  $5 million of the increase in the recent quarter was in the commercial and industrial portfolio as several loans were downgraded to special mention as potential weaknesses were identified in those credits.  The level of criticized loans can fluctuate as new information is constantly received on the Company s borrowers and their financial circumstances change over time.  The level of criticized loans at September 30, 2016 is consistent with the level of criticized loans at the previous year-end.    As noted in Note 4 to the Company s Unaudited Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, internal risk ratings are the credit quality indicators used by the Company s management to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses for commercial credits.   Special mention  and  substandard  loans are weaker credits with a higher risk of loss   categorized as  criticized  credits rather   than    pass  or  watch  credits. 

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses that in management s judgment appropriately reflects losses inherent in the loan portfolio.        The allowa  nce for loan   losses totaled   $14 million or   1.50  % of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2016, compared with $13 million or 1.50  % of total loans outstanding as of   June 30, 2016 and $13 million or 1.66  % of total loans outstanding at   December 31  ,   2015  .  The   allowance   for loan losses increased in the third quarter as the Company recorded a $1 million provision for loan loss due to loan growth, increased criticized loan balances, and increased specific reserve levels on impaired loans while incurring minimal net charge-offs.  The allowance to loan ratio of 1.50% was unchanged quarter over quarter as the increase in the allowance for loan loss was commensurate with the loan growth during the quarter.  However, the ratio has declined since year-end despite the increase in the allowance due to the Company s strong loan growth.    The net charge-off (recovery) ratio for the   third quarter of 2016 was 0.03% of average net loans, compared with a ratio of (  0.  01)  % and 0.0  3  % in the   second quarter of 2016   and   third quarter   of 2015, respectively. 

Investing Activities 

Total securities were $  105 million at September 30, 2016, compared with $111 million at June    3  0  , 2016 and $99 million at December 31, 2015.  Interest-bearing deposits at other banks, which consist of overnight funds kept at correspondent banks and the Federal Reserve,   in  creased to $  4 million at September   30, 2016 from $  1 million at June    3  0  , 2016  , but decreased from   $11 million at December 31, 2015.  The Company   has   experienced   strong loan growth in 2016, resulting   in the decrease in short-term interest-bearing deposits at banks   from the previous year-end  .  In addition, there was slight run-off in the investment securities portfolio as management decided not to leverage the balance sheet given the uncertain rate env  ironment at the end of the thir  d quarter.  Securities and interest-bearing deposits at correspondent banks made up   11  % of the Bank s total average inte  rest earning assets in the thir  d quarter of 2016,   down from 14% in the second   quarter of 2016   and     17% in last year s thir  d quarter. 

The Company s highest concentration in its securities portfolio was in available for sale U.S. government sponsored mortgage-backed securities   at 49% of   to  tal investment securities at each of September 30, 2016 and June    3  0  , 2016  , compared with   38% at December 31, 2015.  The concentration in tax-advantaged debt securities issued by state and political subdivisions and U.S. government-sponsored agency bonds was   37  % and   14  %, respectively, of the total securities portfolio at   September 30, 2016, compared with 35% and 16  % at   June    3  0  , 2016 and 40% and 22% at December 31, 2015. 

Management believes that the credit quality of the securities portfolio as a whole is strong, as the portfolio has no individual securities in a significant unrealized loss position.    Interest rates increased slightly in the third quarter of 2016 after declining in each of the first two quarters of 2016  ,    resulting in   a   de  crease in the net unrealized gain position of the available-for-sale investment portfolio to $  1.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $2  .  2   million at   June    3  0  , 2016  .  The net unrealized gain was   $0.8 million at December 31, 2015. 

The Company monitors extension and prepayment risk in the securities portfolio to limit potential exposures.  The Company has   no   exposure to subprime mortgages, nor does the Company hold private mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, or FNMA or FHLMC preferred stock investments in its investment portfolio.

Funding Activities 

Total deposits   at   September 30, 2016 were $898 million, a $28 million or 3% increase from $870 million at June 30, 2016 and a $95 million or 12% increase from   $  803   million   at December 31, 2015  .    The growth in the current quarter reflected growth in savings deposits of $  17   million, demand deposits of $8 million, and time deposits of $5 million.  NOW deposits declined $2 million during the recent quarter.  The $95 million deposit growth since the previous year-end reflects growth across all product categories including savings deposits of $57 million, time deposits of $22 million, demand deposits of $13 million, and NOW deposits of $3 million.  With market disruption in the Western New York market due to a significant merger between two of the Company s competitors, the Company has maintained promotional savings and time deposit rates in an effort to attract new customers.  The decline in NOW deposits during the third quarter reflects fluctuation in the Company s municipal deposit portfolio.  Due to the transactional nature of demand deposits, average balances are a useful metric to meaningfully measure sustained growth rates.  Average demand deposits were $187 million in the current quarter, a 5% increase from $178 million in the second quarter of 2016 and 11% higher than the $169 million average balance in the third quarter of 2015.  Most of the Company s demand deposit growth during the current year has been with commercial customers.   

T  he Company   had   $51 million other borrowings at September 30, 2016, which consisted of $10   million in a long-term advance with the FHLBNY scheduled to mature in 2020,   and $41 million in overnight borrowings.  Other borrowings were $16 million     at June 30, 2016 and $10 million at December 31, 2015.  The Company has increased the usage of its overnight line of credit with FHLBNY during the past two quarters, particularly in the third quarter, as a funding source for its loan growth.  Loan growth significantly outpaced deposit growth, the Company s core funding source, in the third quarter.

Net Income 

Net income was $2.  2   million  , or $0.51   per diluted share, in the   thir  d quarter of 2016, compared with $  2  .  0   million  ,   or $0.4  6   per diluted share  , in the second   quarter of 201  6   and $  2  .  5   million  ,   or $0.  58   per diluted share  ,   in last year s   thir  d quarter  .  The increase from the 2016 trailing second quarter reflects an increase in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher provision for loan loss.  The decline from last year s third quarter reflects the after-tax gain of $0.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the prior year period from an insurance settlement related to a fire sustained at a branch location  ,   as well as an increase in provision for loan loss, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.  Return on average equity was 9.23% for the third quarter of 2016 compared with 8.56% in the trailing second quarter and 11.20% in the third quarter of 2015. 

The Company had net income of $5.9 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2016, compared with $6.1 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in the comparable period of 2015.  The decrease in net income is related to the decline in noninterest income and increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by the increase in net interest income and   a   tax benefit   related to   historic rehabilitation tax credits   realized during the first nine months of 2016.    The   $2.2 million   decline in noninterest income in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared with the prior year period reflects the gain on the insurance settlement in 2015 and a loss taken on a tax credit investment. 

Other Results of Operations   Quarterly Comparison 

Net interest income was $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.6 million or 6% from the second quarter of 2016 and $0.9 million or 11% from the prior-year third quarter, reflecting strong loan and demand deposit growth.  The Company s commercial loan portfolio continued to grow at a significant rate as average commercial loans, including both commercial and industrial   loans   and commercial real estate loans, were $712 million in the third quarter, up 11% from $642 million in the trailing second quarter and up 28% from $557 million in the 2015 third quarter. 

Net interest margin of 3.67% declined 18 basis points from the 2015 third quarter, but improved 2 basis points from the second quarter of 2016.  The margin contraction from last year reflects a continued decrease in loan yields as market rates remain historically low in a highly competitive market.  The margin improvement from the trailing second quarter was due to a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities as interest-bearing deposit rates declined 4 basis points.  This improvement in deposit pricing was somewhat offset by a decrease in loan yields. 

The Company recorded $1.0 million in loan loss provision in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a release of allowance for loan losses of $0.4 million in the trailing second quarter and a provision for loan loss of $0.4 million in the prior year third quarter.  The increase in loan loss provision reflects the Company s significant loan growth during the   third   quarter   of 2016  , the movement of a small number of commercial loan relationships to criticized status, and increased specific reserves on impaired loans, partially offset by other more favorable credit quality trends such as lower non-performing loans and a charge-off ratio that has been sustained at historically low levels  . 

Noninterest income was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase from $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2016, but lower than the $4.3 million earned in the prior year third quarter.  The primary reason for the increase in the   third   quarter from the second quarter of 2016 was the $2.1 million loss recorded   during the second quarter   on a tax credit investment in a community-based project in the linked quarter.  The loss on the investment was offset by a $1.5 million refundable state tax credit in noninterest income and $0.6 million in tax benefits realized in income tax expense during the second quarter of 2016.  The Company recognized additional tax benefits of $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2016.  The decrease in noninterest income in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the prior year period reflected   a $0.7 million gain recorded in last year s third quarter for an insurance settlement related to a fire sustained at a branch location. 

The largest component of noninterest income, insurance     service and fee   revenue  , was $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.   Insurance revenue increased $0.3 million from the trailing second quarter due to the seasonal increase in commercial lines insurance commissions.  The $0.1 million decline from the previous year s third quarter was due to a decrease in personal lines insurance commissions and financial services sales revenue, partially offset by strong commercial lines insurance revenue growth.       

Total non-interest expense was $8.7 million in the   thir  d quarter of 2016,   which was flat   when compared with   the second quarter of 2016, but 5% higher than $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2015.    The third quarter of 2015 included a $0.2 million reversal in the Company s litigation reserve after a legal matter was settled during the period.  Salaries and benefits costs   of $5.4 million   in the third quarter   of 2016   decreased $0.1 million when compared with the second quarter of 2016, reflecting stabilization in the number of employees at the Company during the third quarter of 2016.  The   3%   increase   in salaries and benefits costs   from last year s third quarter reflects annual merit increases and strategic hires to support the Company s continued growth, most notably in the expansion of its commercial banking team with new commercial loan officers, business development officers and related support staff. 

The efficiency ratio for the current quarter was 7  0  .  2  %, compared with 7  6  .  3  % in the   second   quarter of 2016 and   66  .  8% in last year s thir  d quarter.    The calculation of the efficiency ratio   for the second quarter of 2016   excludes the   net impact of   the tax credit

investment.        The increase in the efficiency ratio this quarter when compared with last year s third quarter is   the $0.7 million gain related to the insurance settlement in the third quarter of 2015. 

Income tax expense of $0.5 million was recognized for the   thir  d quarter of 2016, compared with an income tax expense of $0.  5   million in the   second   quarter of 2016 and   $1.2 million in the thir  d quarter of 2015.    The effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% compared with 18.3% in the second quarter of 2016 and 32.6% in the third quarter of 2015.  The lower effective tax rate over the two most recent quarters reflects the impact of the historic tax credit transaction in the second quarter of 2016. 

Other Results of Operations   Year-to-Date Comparison 

Net interest income was $25.8 million for the first nine months of 2016, a $2.5 million or 11% increase from the first nine months of 2015.  The increase in net interest income is attributable to a $111 million or 13% increase in average interest-earning assets, somewhat offset by a decrease in net interest margin as described below.  The increase in average interest-earning assets reflects average net loan growth of $123 million or 18% to $817 million during the first nine months of 2016.  Most of the growth was in commercial loans, including $79 million in average commercial real estate loans and $33 million in commercial and industrial loans. 

The Company s net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 3.76% in the first nine months of 2015 to 3.67% in the first nine months of 2016.  The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased 6 basis points from 4.22% to 4.16%.  Average loan yields decreased 19 basis points from 4.64% to 4.45%.  The decline in the yield on interest-earning assets was less than the decrease in average loan yields due to a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets.  Average loans were 87% of total average interest-earnings assets in the first nine months of 2016, compared with 84% in the first nine months of the prior year.  Loans have earned higher yields than investment securities and short-term interest-earning cash over the past two years.  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.64% for the first three quarters of 2016, 4 basis points higher than the 0.60% rate for the first nine months of 2015. The increased rate reflected a higher average savings rate of 0.49% in the year to date period ended September 30, 2016, compared with 0.36% in the comparable period in 2015.  Average savings deposit rates have increased as the product with the highest growth rate in the savings deposit portfolio has been at a promotional rate in 2016 in an effort to attract new customers at a time of disruption in the Company s footprint due to bank merger activity. 

The Company re  cord  ed $0.  8   million in   provision   for loan loss  es   in the   nine  -  month period ended September 30, 2016  , compared with $  1  .  0   million in the first   nine   months of 2015.  The year-over-year decrease is attributable to   the benefit of   a sustained period of low charge-offs,   partially offset by provision needed for the Company s strong loan growth. 

Non-interest income for the first   nine   months of 2016 decreased $  2  .  2   million from the prior year period to $  8  .  6   million.  The decrease was predominantly a result of   the   $2.  1   million loss on   the     historic   tax credit   in the second quarter of 2016 and the $0.7 million gain on insurance proceeds in the third quarter of 2015 related to a fire at a branch location,   offset  , in part,   by a $1.5 million refundable state tax credit   recorded   in non-interest income during the second quarter   of 2016  .    Additionally, i  nsurance service and fee   revenue, the largest component of non-interest income, was $5.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, down from $5.6 million in the comparable period of the prior year.  The decline was   primarily due to last year s high level of claims adjustment fees earned for services provided to assess damages of local properties impacted by the previous year s severe winter  .  This decrease was   somewhat offset by   an   increase in commercial property and casualty     insurance   commissions  .  Other non-interest income was $  1  .  3   million for the first   three quarters   of 2016, compared with $1.  7   million in the first   nine   months of 2015.  The decline from the prior year period is predominantly due to a decline in the Company   s   mortgage servicing rights asset and the   expected run-off of data center income. 

Total non-interest   expense increased   to $  26  .  0   million in the first   nine   months of 2016  , 8% higher than   the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2015  .  The increase was   mostly attributable to an increase in salaries and employee benefits costs.  Salaries and employee benefits costs were $1  6  .  4   million for the first   nine   months of 2016, a $1.  3   million or   8% increase from $15  .  1   million in the prior year period.  The year-over-year increase in salary and benefits expense reflects annual merit increases and personnel hires to support the Company s growth strategy.  Technology and commu  nications expenses increased $0.2   million to $  1  .  1   million, reflecting additional expense related to the Company s conversion to a new core banking system in 2016. 

The Company s efficiency ratio for the first   nine   months of 2016 was 7  4  .0%, compared with 7  0  .  3  % during the prior-year period.    The in  crease reflects the increase in non-interest expenses and decrease in non-interest income, somewhat offset by the in  crease in net interest income.    The calculation of the efficiency ratio   for 2016   excludes the   net impact of   the tax credit investment. 

An income tax   expense   of $  1  .  7   million was recognized for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016, compared with   $  3  .  0   million in   the first nine months of 2015  .  The difference reflected a $  0  .  8   million tax credit benefit realized in   2016   relating to the historic tax credit investment in a community project.    The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 22.5%,   compared with 3  3  .  3  % in   the comparable 2015 period.    Excluding the impact of the historic tax credit and the write-off of the tax credit investment recognized in non-interest income, the current   year-to-date   effective tax rate was 3  1  .  0%  .

CAPITAL 

The Company consistently maintains regulatory capital ratios significantly above the federal  well capitalized  standard, including   a    Tier 1 leverage ratio   of   9.55% at September 30, 2016, compared with   10.  06  % and 10.45%     at   June 30  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  , respectively.  New minimum capital ratios, known as  Basel III , became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.  As of   September 30  , 201  6  , the Company and the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules. 

Book value per share of the Company s common stock   was $  22.20   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with $  21.44   at December 31, 201  5  .  Tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP measure) at   September 30, 2016   was $  20.31  , compared with $  19.53   at December 31, 201  5.  

Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.  The Company calculates tangible book value per share by dividing tangible book value by the number of common shares outstanding, as compared to GAAP book value per share, which the Company calculates by dividing GAAP book value by the number of common shares outstanding.  Management believes that this information is consistent with treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.  Accordingly, management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding the Company s capital position and ratios.  Further, management believes that presentation of this measure, together with the accompanying reconciliation, provides a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company s business and allows investors to view the Company s performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and regulatory agencies.  However, this non-GAAP financial measure is supplemental and is not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP financial measures.  Note that other companies may use different calculations for this measure, and, therefore, the Company s presentation of tangible book value per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Investors should review the Company s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and should not rely on any single financial measure.    

A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure, tangible book value per share, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, book value, is set forth in the following table  :

On   August   16, 2016, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.38 per share on the Company s outstanding common stock.      The dividend   was paid   on   October 4  , 2016 to shareholders of record as of   September 13  , 2016. 

LIQUIDITY 

The Bank utilizes cash flows from the investment portfolio and federal funds sold balances to manage the liquidity requirements related to loan demand and deposit fluctuations.  The Bank   also has many borrowing options.  As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is able to borrow funds at competitive rates.  Advances of up to $2  07   million can   be drawn on the FHLB via an Overnight Line of Credit Agreement between the Bank and the FHLB.  An amount   equal to 25% of the Bank s total assets could be borrowed through the advance programs under certain qualifying circumstances.  The Bank also has the ability to purchase up to $14 million in federal funds from its correspondent banks.  By placing sufficient collateral in safekeeping at the Federal Reserve Bank  , the Bank could borrow at the discount window.  The Bank s liquidity needs also can be met by more aggressively pursuing time deposits, or accessing the brokered time deposit market, including the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS ) network. 

Cash flows from the Bank s investment portfolio are laddered, so that securities mature at regular intervals, to provide funds from principal and interest payments at various times   as liquidity needs may arise.  Contractual maturities are also laddered, with consideration as to the volatility of market prices.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   5  % of the Bank s securities had contractual maturity dates of one year or less and approximately   35  % had maturity dates of five years or less. 

The Company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the Bank.  Additionally, the Company has access to capital markets as a funding source.

Management, on an ongoing basis, closely monitors the Company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business.  As part of that monitoring process, management calculates the 90-day liquidity each month by analyzing the cash needs of the Bank.  Included in the calculation are liquid assets and potential liabilities.  Management stresses the potential liabilities calculation to ensure a strong   liquidity position.  Included in the   calculation are assumptions of some significant deposit run-off as well as funds needed for loan closings and investment purchases.     I  n the   Company s internal stress test a  t    September 30, 2016   the Company had net short-term liquidity of $  2  45   million as compared with $282 million at December 31, 2015, due to the usage of cash for loan growth.  Available assets of $11  3   million, divided by public and purchased funds of $1  73   million, resulted in a long-term liquidity ratio of   65  % at   September   30, 2016, compared with 102% at December 31, 2015. 

Management does not an  ticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long term, for which adequate funding would not be available and which would therefore result in significant pressure on liquidity. 

The Company believes that the Bank maintains a sufficient level of U.S. government and government agency securities and New York State municipal bonds that can be pledged as collateral for municipal deposits. 

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Additional information responsive to this Item is contained in the Liquidity section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates of the Bank s financial instruments.      The primary market risk   that   the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk.      The core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking expose the Bank to interest rate risk, which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.      As a result, net interest income earned by the Bank is subject to the effects of changing interest rates.      The Bank measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.      Management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income to changes in net interest rates.      The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans  ,   and deposits.      Management supplements the modeling technique described above with analysis of market values of the Bank s financial instruments and changes to such market values given   changes in the interest rates. 

The Bank s Asset-Liability Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the Bank s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit taking activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities.      When deemed prudent, management has taken actions, and intends to do so in the future, to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments.      Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changing the pricing of loan and deposit products, and modifying the composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and   reliance on   other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.

Table of Contents  

The followin  g table demonstrates the possible impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank s net interest income over a 12-month period of time: 

SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES 

Many assumptions were utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on the Bank s net interest income.      The more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities.      The Bank assumed immediate changes in rates including 200 basis point rate changes.      In   each of   the   100 and   200 basis point rate   reduction scenarios  , the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates   are not   less than zero.      These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Bank cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income.      Actual results may differ significantly due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes.      In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the Bank s projected net interest income. 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

DISCLOSURE     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016   (the end of the period covered by this Report).  Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that as of   September 30, 2016   the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

No changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting were identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 201  6   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The nature of the Company s business generates a certain amount of litigation involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business. 

In the opinion of management, there are no proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or to which its property is subject, which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.   

ITEM 2       UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

In March 2013, the Company announced it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 100,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock.  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock  .
