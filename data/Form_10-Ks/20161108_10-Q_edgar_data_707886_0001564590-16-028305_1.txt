 BASIS OF PRESENTATION     

 United Community Financial Corp. (United Community or the Company) was incorporated under Ohio law in February 1998 by The Home Savings and Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio (Home Savings) in connection with the conversion of Home Savings from an Ohio mutual savings and loan association to an Ohio capital stock savings association (the Conversion). Upon consummation of the Conversion on July 8, 1998, United Community became the unitary thrift holding company for Home Savings. Home Savings, a state-chartered savings bank, conducts business from its main office located in Youngstown, Ohio, 31 retail banking offices and loan production centers located throughout Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  On January 29, 2016, United Community acquired Forge Financial Services Inc. d/b/a James   Sons Insurance Company of Youngstown Ohio.  James   Sons Insurance, a subsidiary of United Community, is engaged in the business of selling insurance including auto, commercial, homeowners and life-health insurance. 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements of United Community have been prepared in accordance with instructions relating to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods.  
 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes contained in United Community s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Community and its subsidiaries.  All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated.  Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on prior year consolidated statements of operations or shareholders  equity.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS     

 In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The ASU creates a new topic, Topic 606, to provide guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  The ASU amends the current consolidation guidance and affects both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance as of January 1, 2016 did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 8 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-1  , Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   ASU 2016-1, among   other things, (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair valu  es by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financia  l instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately   in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair val  ue option for financial instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii)   clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginn  ing after December 15, 2017.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 -  Leases (Topic 842) . The ASU will require all organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures will be required so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation.  The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  Key provisions include the elimination of  windfall pools  and removes the requirement to delay recognition of a windfall tax benefit until it reduces current taxes payable.  Additionally, the simplification permits entities to withhold an amount up to the employees  maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without resulting in a liability classification of the award.  Entities are now permitted to make accounting policy elections for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards.  Lastly, there are two provisions that are only available to companies that are nonpublic business entities, as defined in ASC 718: (i) a practical expedient for determining the expected term of certain share-based awards, which would be adopted prospectively, and (ii) a one-time opportunity to change its measurement basis for all liability-classified awards to intrinsic value upon adoption of the ASU.  The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period.  For all other entities, it is effective for annual periods beginning after December 17, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Management has elected not to early-adopt this ASU and is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.      
 In June 2016, FASB Issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.    This ASU adds a new Topic 326 to the Codification and removes the thresholds that companies apply to measure credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as loans, receivables, and held-to-maturity debt securities. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses when it is probable that the loss has been incurred. The revised guidance will remove all recognition thresholds and will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses for the difference between the amortized cost basis of a financial instrument and the amount of amortized cost that the company expects to collect over the instrument s contractual life. ASU 2016-13 also amends the credit loss measurement guidance for available-for-sale debt securities and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for  public business entities,  as defined, that are SEC filers for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. All other entities, including not-for-profit entities and employee benefit plans within the scope of ASC 960 through 965 on plan accounting, will be required to adopt the guidance in ASU 2016-13 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption of the guidance is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 9 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classi  fication of C  e  rtain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which amends the guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice that   has resulted from the lack of consistent principles on this topic. The ASU s amendments add or clarify guidance on eight cash flow issues:  

Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs.    

Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing.    

Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination.    

Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims.    

Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies.    

Distributions received from equity method investees.    

Beneficial interests in securitization transactions.    

Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.    

 For public business entities, the guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years   beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all   other entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim   periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for   all entities. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may   apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be   impracticable.   Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 STOCK COMPENSATION     

  Stock Options:   
 On April 30, 2015, shareholders approved the United Community Financial Corp. 2015 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2015 Plan). The purpose of the 2015 Plan is to provide a means through which United Community may attract and retain employees and non-employee directors, to provide incentives that align their interest with those of United Community s shareholders and promote the success of United Community s business.  All employees and non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2015 Plan.  The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,200,000 shares that are to be used for awards of stock options, stock awards, stock units, stock appreciation rights, annual bonus awards and long-term incentive awards.  
 On April 26, 2007, shareholders approved the United Community Financial Corp. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the 2007 Plan). The purpose of the 2007 Plan was to promote and advance the interests of United Community and its shareholders by enabling United Community to attract, retain and reward directors, directors emeritus, managerial and other key employees of United Community, including Home Savings, by facilitating their purchase of an ownership interest in United Community. The 2007 Plan was terminated on April 30, 2015 upon the adoption of the 2015 Plan, although the 2007 Plan survives so long as awards issued under the 2007 Plan remain outstanding and exercisable.  The 2007 Plan provided for the issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares that were to be used for awards of restricted stock, stock options, performance awards, stock appreciation rights (SARs), or other forms of stock-based incentive awards.  
 On July 12, 1999, shareholders approved the United Community Financial Corp. 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the 1999 Plan). The purpose of the 1999 Plan was the same as the 2007 Plan. The 1999 Plan terminated on May 20, 2009, although the 1999 Plan survives so long as options issued under the 1999 Plan remain outstanding and exercisable. The 1999 Plan provided for the grant of either incentive or nonqualified stock options. Options were awarded at exercise prices that were not less than the fair market value of the share at the grant date. The maximum number of common shares that could be issued under the 1999 Plan was 3,569,766. Because the 1999 Plan terminated, no additional options may be issued under it.  
 There were no stock options granted in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and there were 2,259 and 6,618 stock options granted in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The options must be exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.  Expenses related to stock option grants are included with salaries and employee benefits. The Company recognized $2,000 and $8,000 in stock option expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Company recognized $6,000 and $19,000 in stock option expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company expects to recognize additional expense of $1,000 for the remainder of 2016, and $1,000 in 2017.  
 10 

A summary of activity in the plans is as follows:   

Information related to the stock option plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows:  

As of September 30, 2016, the cost of nonvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 6 months.  
 The Company did not grant options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The fair value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of the grant date:  

Outstanding stock options at September 30, 2016 have a weighted average remaining life of 3.60 years and may be exercised in the range of $1.20 to $5.89.  
  Restricted Stock Awards:   
 The 2007 Plan permitted and the 2015 Plan permits the issuance of restricted stock awards to employees and nonemployee directors. Nonvested shares at September 30, 2016 aggregated 343,178, of which 9,976 will vest during the remainder of 2016, 142,003 will vest in 2017, 97,928 will vest in 2018 and 93,271 will vest in 2019. Expenses related to restricted stock awards are charged to salaries and employee benefits and are recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the shares at the grant date. The Company recognized approximately $254,000 and $716,000 in restricted stock award expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recognized approximately $183,000 and $549,000 in restricted stock award expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The Company expects to recognize additional expenses of approximately $240,000 in 2016, $614,000 in 2017, $409,000 in 2018 and $136,000 in 2019.  The total average per share fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5.87.  
 11 

A summary of changes in the Company s nonvested restricted shares for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:   

Executive Incentive Plan  
 The Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) provides incentive compensation awards to certain officers of the Company. Executive incentive awards are generally based upon the actual performance of the Company and individual participant performance for the twelve months ending December 31, compared to the actual performance of a peer group during the same twelve month period. The target incentive awards for each year are measured as a percentage of the base salary of participating officers.  Once the awards under the EIP are calculated, they are paid 80% in cash and 20% in restricted stock. The restricted stock vests equally over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the date the restricted stock is issued.  The Company incurred $96,000 and $265,000 in expense for the restricted stock portion of the EIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and $306,000 and $924,000 for the cash portion of the EIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Company incurred $63,000 and $193,000 in expense for the restricted stock portion of the EIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $244,000 and $731,000 for the cash portion of the EIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Restricted stock expenses for the EIP are included in the total restricted stock expenses discussed above.   
  Long-term Incentive Plan  
 The Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides a long-term incentive compensation opportunity to certain executive officers, whose participation and target award opportunities will be approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Each participant in the LTIP will be granted a target number of Performance Share Units (PSUs).  Target PSUs will be determined as a percentage of base salary and translated into share units based on the Company s average stock price at the appropriate measurement date.  The performance period for the annual grant for a given year will be from January 1, year 1 through December 31, year 3.   The Company incurred $96,000 and $289,000 for the LTIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Company incurred $1,000 and $72,000 in expense for the LTIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2015, Home Savings transferred securities with a total amortized cost of $105.3 million with a corresponding fair value of $103.8 million from available for sale to held to maturity.  The net unrealized loss,   net of taxes, on these securities at the date of transfer was $999,000.  The fair value at the date of transfer becomes the securities  new cost basis.  The unrealized holding loss at the time of transfer continues to be reported in accumulated other compr  ehensive income, net of tax and is amortized over the remaining lives of the securities as an adjustment of the yield.  The amortization of the unamortized holding loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will directly offset the effect on i  nterest income from the accretion of the reduced amortized cost for the transferred securities.  Because of this transfer, the total losses less than 12 months and greater than 12 months reported in the table above will not agree to the unrealized losses r  eported in the inventory of held to maturity securities.  The inventory table reports unrealized gains and losses based upon the transferred securities adjusted cost basis and current fair value.  The reporting of losses less than 12 months and greater tha  n 12 months represents that actual period of time that these securities have been in an unrealized loss position and the securities amortized cost basis as if the transfer did not occur.     
 There were no U.S. Treasury and government sponsored entities (GSE) securities that were temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  All of the U.S. Treasury and government sponsored entities (GSE) securities that were temporarily impaired at December 31, 2015, were impaired due to the level of interest rates at that time of purchase compared to current interest rates. Unrealized losses on these securities have not been recognized into income as of December 31, 2015 because the issuer s securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. There is risk that longer term rates could rise further resulting in greater unrealized losses.  The Company expects to realize all interest and principal on these securities and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery.  
 All of the obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions that were temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016, were impaired due to the level of interest rates at that time.  Unrealized losses on these securities have not been recognized into income as of September 30, 2016 because the issuer s securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. 
 All of the mortgage-backed securities that were temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were issued by U.S. government sponsored agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Company expects to realize all interest and principal on these securities.  
 Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities were $5.2 million and $0, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Gross gains of $218,000 and $0 were realized on these sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Income tax expense related to net realized gains was $76,000 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
 Proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities were $33.7 million and $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Gross gains of $604,000 and $11,000 were realized on these sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense related to net realized gains was $211,000 and $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Allowance For Loan Losses 

17 

Allowance For Loan Losses  

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required based on an analysis using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations, estimated collateral values, general economic conditions in the market area and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged-off. 
 Other loans not reviewed specifically by management are evaluated as a homogenous group of loans (generally single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credits except marine loans) using a loss factor applied to the outstanding loan balance to determine the level of reserve required. This loss factor consists of two components, a quantitative and a qualitative component. The quantitative component is based on a historical analysis of all charged-off loans, net of recoveries. In determining the qualitative factors, consideration is given to such attributes as lending policies, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, management, loan quality trend, loan review, collateral value, concentrations, economic cycles and other external factors.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company evaluated 17 quarters of net charge-off history and applied this information to the current period.  This component is combined with the qualitative component to arrive at the loss factor, which is applied to the outstanding balance of homogenous loans.

The unpaid principal balance is the total amount of the loan that is due to Home Savings. The recorded investment includes the unpaid principal balance less any chargeoffs or partial chargeoffs applied to specific loans. The unpaid principal balance and the recorded investment both exclude accrued interest receivable and deferred loan costs, both of which are immaterial.

Within secured and nonresidential impaired loans, there are two related credits with a total principal balan  ce outstanding of $6.9 million.  The source of repayment for the loan resides in funds held in escrow by a court that has administered foreclosure and receivership proceedings surrounding the loan.  The loan has been subject to protracted litigation and a   reserve of $546,000 was placed on one of the loans during 2015.      
 Home Savings reclassifies a collateralized mortgage loan and consumer loans secured by real estate to real estate owned and other repossessed assets once it has either obtained legal title to the real estate collateral or the borrower voluntarily conveys all interest in the real property to the Bank to satisfy the loan through a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement.  The table below presents loans that are in the process of foreclosure at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, but legal title, deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement to the property has not yet been obtained:

The troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted described above resulted in no charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, and had no effect on the provision for loan losses. 
 A troubled debt restructuring is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
 In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed in accordance with the Company s internal underwriting policy.  
 Credit Quality Indicators:  
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes homogeneous loans past due 90 cumulative days, and all non-homogeneous loans including commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. Smaller balance homogeneous loans are primarily monitored by payment status.  
 Asset quality ratings are divided into two groups: Pass (unclassified) and Classified. Within the unclassified group, certain loans that display potential weakness are risk rated as special mention. In addition, there are three classified risk ratings: substandard, doubtful and loss. These specific credit risk categories are defined as follows:  
 Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.   
 Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   
 33 

Doubtful  .   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, h  ighly questionable and improbable.   
 Loss.  Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value, that continuance as assets is not warranted. Although there may be a chance of recovery on these assets, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset.   
 The Company monitors loans on a monthly basis to determine if they should be included in one of the categories listed above. All impaired non-homogeneous credits classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are analyzed on an individual basis for a specific reserve requirement. This analysis is performed on each individual credit at least annually or more frequently if warranted.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows:

      FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT      

 Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset if paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.  
 Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  
 Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  
 United Community uses the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument:  
 Available for sale securities : The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2).   
 Impaired loans:  At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.   
 Other real estate owned:  Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Real estate owned properties are individually evaluated at least annually for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.   
 Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by Home Savings. Once received, a member of the Special Assets Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with the independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. In addition to the Special Assets Department review, a third party independent review is also performed.  On an annual basis, Home Savings compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recent appraised value to determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value. At the time a property is acquired and classified as real estate owned, the fair value is determined utilizing the most appropriate method. A fair value in excess of $250,000 will be supported by an appraisal. After determination of fair value, each property will be recorded at the lower of cost (i.e., recorded investment in the loan) or the estimated net realizable value on the date of transfer to real estate owned. In determining net realizable value, reductions to fair market value may be taken for estimated costs of sale, conditions that must be remedied immediately upon acquisition, and other factors that negatively impact the marketability and prompt sale of the property.  
 Mortgage servicing rights:  On a quarterly basis, loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an individual tranche exceeds fair value, impairment is recorded on that tranche so that the servicing asset is carried at fair value. Fair value is determined at a tranche level, based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model utilizes assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income and that can be validated against available market data (Level 2).   
 37 

Loans held for sale:   Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is evaluated on a pool-level basis. The fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other   observable market data, such as outstanding commitments from third party investors (Level 2).   
 Loans held for sale, at fair value :  The Company elected the fair value option for all permanent construction loans held for sale originated on or after January 1, 2015. The fair value of the Company s construction perm loans held for sale was determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets.  The fair value of permanent construction loans held for sale is determined, based on the committed loan amount, using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan and other unobservable market data, such as time it takes to complete the project (Level 3).  The Company elected the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans held for sale originated on or after March 1, 2016. The fair value of the Company s residential mortgage loans held for sale was determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets (Level 2).  
 Interest rate caps:  Home Savings uses an independent third party that performs a market valuation analysis for interest rate caps. The methodology used consists of a discounted cash flow model, all future floating cash flows are projected and both floating and fixed cash flows are discounted to the valuation date. The yield curve utilized for discounting and projecting is built by obtaining publicly available third party market quotes from Reuters, which handle up to 30-year swap maturities (Level 3). Assumptions used in the valuation of interest rate caps are back-tested for reasonableness on a quarterly basis using an independent source along with a third party service.   
 Purchased and written certificate of deposit option:  Home Savings periodically enters into written and purchased option derivative instruments to facilitate the Power CD. The written and purchased options are mirror derivative instruments which are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Home Savings uses an independent third party that performs a market valuation analysis for purchased and written certificate of deposit options. (Level 2)

Impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses, carried at fair value, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a net carrying amount of $7.7 million at September 30, 2016, that includes a specific valuation allowance of $989,000. This resulted in a increase of the provision for loan losses of $134,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and an increase of $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses, carried at fair value, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a net carrying amount of $4.5 million at September 30, 2015, which includes a specific valuation allowance of $609,000. This resulted in a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $35,000 and $104,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses, carried at fair value, which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a net carrying amount of $4.9 million at December 31, 2015, that includes a specific valuation allowance of $548,000.  
 The significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral dependent impaired loans included in the above table primarily relate to the adjustment between carrying values versus appraised value. During the reported periods, discounts applied to appraisals for estimated selling costs were 10%.  
 At September 30, 2016, mortgage servicing rights carried at fair value were $3.3 million, with a net valuation allowance of $741,000 At September 30, 2015, mortgage servicing rights, carried at fair value totaled $1.1 million, resulting in a net valuation allowance of $150,000.  At December 31, 2015, mortgage servicing rights carried at fair value were $604,000.  Mortgage servicing rights are valued by an independent third party that is active in purchasing and selling these instruments.  Net (recovery) impairment reflected in other income totaled $(25,000) and $702,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  Net impairment reflected in other income totaled $138,000 and $92,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The value reflects the characteristics of the underlying loans.   
 At September 30, 2016, other real estate owned, carried at fair value, which is measured for impairment using the fair value of the property less estimated selling costs, and had a net carrying amount of $1.0 million, with a valuation allowance of $1.0 million. This resulted in a (recovery) expense of $1,000 and $(25,000) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  At September 30, 2015, other real estate owned, carried at fair value, which is measured for impairment using the fair value of the property less estimated selling costs, and had a net carrying amount of $2.2 million with a valuation allowance of $1.2 million. This resulted in additional expenses of $39,000 and $162,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2015, other real estate owned had a net carrying amount of $2.0 million, with a valuation allowance of $1.2 million.

Auto loans were excluded from the table above as their value is considered immaterial.

The Company has elected the fair value option for newly originated residential mortgage and permanent construction loans held for sale.  These loans are intended for sa  le and the Company believes that fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans.  Interest income is recorded based on the contractual terms of the loan and in accordance with the Company s policy on loans held for investment.    None of t  hese loans are 90 or more days past due nor on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2016.         

The total amount of gains and losses from changes in fair value included in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for loans held for sale, at fair value were: 

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the carrying value and estimated fair values of financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:  

43 

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows:  
 (a) Cash and Cash Equivalents    
 The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.  
 (b) FHLB Stock    
 It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  
 (c) Held to maturity securities 
 Fair values for held to maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows. 
 (d) Loans    
 Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows: for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification; fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification; and impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
 44 

(e) Deposits     
 The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying amounts of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed and variable rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
 (f) Other Borrowings    
 Short-term borrowings, generally maturing within 90 days, approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification. The fair values of Home Savings long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
 (g) Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable    
 The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification, depending on the classification of the underlying asset or liability.  
 (h) Off-balance Sheet Instruments    
 Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material.

The Company has granted stock compensation awards with nonforfeitable dividend rights which are considered participating securities. As such, earnings per share is computed using the two-class method as required by ASC 206-10-45. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period which excludes the participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares from stock compensation awards, but also excludes awards considered participating securities. No stock options were anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and stock options for 76,317 shares were anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  No stock options were anti-dilutive for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and stock options for 76,317 shares were anti-dilutive for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)     

 Other comprehensive income (loss) included in the consolidated statements of shareholders  equity consists of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, disproportional tax effects and changes in unrealized gains and losses on the postretirement liability. The change includes reclassification of net gains or (losses) and impairment charges on sales of securities of $218,000 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $604,000 and $11,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Reclassifications also include amortization of unrealized gains on postretirement plan and accretion of unrealized loss on held to maturity securities.

Other comprehensive income (loss) components and related tax effects for the three-month periods are as follows:  

47 

Other comprehensive income (lo  ss) components and related tax effects for the nine-month periods are as follows:  

48 

As of June 30, 2014, management concluded it was more likely than not that the Company s   net deferred tax asset (DTA) would be realized and accordingly determined a full deferred tax valuation allowance was no longer required. Upon reversal of the former full deferred tax valuation allowance as of June 30, 2014, certain disproportionate tax ef  fects are retained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) totaling approximately a ($16.6) million loss. Almost the entire disproportionate tax effect is attributable to valuation allowance expense recorded through other comprehensive income (los  s) on the tax benefit of losses sustained on the available for sale securities portfolio while the Company was in a full deferred tax valuation allowance. This valuation allowance was appropriately reversed through continuing operations at June 30, 2014, l  eaving the original expense in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), where it will remain in accordance with the Company s election of the  portfolio approach , until such time as the Company would cease to have an available for sale security port  folio.

 REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS     

 Home Savings and United Community are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Home Savings and United Community. The regulations require Home Savings to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines in keeping with the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that involve quantitative measures of Home Savings  assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Home Savings  capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules establish a common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rules also require unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised.  In connection with the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, United Community and Home Savings elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in Common Equity Tier 1 .  The rule limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital risk-based weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meeting its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  
 The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. The capital conservation buffer for 2016 is 0.625%.  The final rule also implemented consolidated capital requirements.     
 Quantitative measures established by regulation for capital adequacy require Home Savings to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 (or Core) capital (as defined in the regulations) to average total assets (as defined) and of total risk-based capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined).   United Community and Home Savings  Common Equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock and related paid-in capital, net of treasury stock, and retained earnings. Common Equity Tier 1 for both United Community and Home Savings is reduced by intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities and subject to transition provisions.  Actual and regulatory required capital ratios for Home Savings, along with the dollar amount of capital implied by such ratios, are presented below.

 Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio     

 Management believes that as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Home Savings meets all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Home Savings was considered well capitalized. There are no known conditions that would change this classification subsequent to September 30, 2016.   
   
 The components of Home Savings  regulatory capital are as follows:

Actual and regulatory required consolidated capital ratios for United Community, along with the dollar amount of capital implied by such ratios, are presented below.   

The components of United Community s consolidated regulatory capital are as follows: 

52 

Significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016, the net DTA was $9.9 million, and as of December 31, 2015, the net DTA was $20.4 million.  
 The Company s ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.  
 United Community s net operating loss of $30.9 million at September 30, 2016 will be carried forward to use against future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the year ending December 31, 2030. In addition, United Community is carrying forward $1.4 million of alternative minimum tax credits. The alternative minimum tax credits are carried forward indefinitely.

United Community cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. United Community advises readers that the factors listed above could affect United Community s financial performance and could cause United Community s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements. United Community undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.  
 Material Changes in Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  
 Total assets increased $172.2 million to $2.2 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. Contributing to the change were increases in net loans of $157.8 million and total loans held for sale of $24.5 million.  
 Funds not currently utilized for general corporate purposes are invested in overnight funds. Cash and cash equivalents increased $8.0 million during the first nine months of 2016.  
 A decrease in available for sale securities was the result of maturities, paydowns and amortization of securities totaling $32.3 million and sales of $32.7 million.  Partially offsetting this activity were purchases aggregating $42.0 million and an increase in the unrealized gain on these securities. The unrealized gain in the available for sale portfolio was $10.8 million at September 30, 2016, compared to an unrealized loss of $3.8 million at December 31, 2015.     
 Net loans increased $157.8 million during the first nine months of 2016. The increase was a combination of growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans during the period. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.  
 The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $18.2 million at September 30, 2016, up from $17.7 million at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.22% at September 30, 2016, compared to 1.33% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 93.76% at September 30, 2016, compared to 105.76% at December 31, 2015. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings  allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310,  Receivables,  and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450,  Contingencies . As of September 30, 2016, the Company evaluated 17 quarters of net charge-off history and applied this information to the current period.  This component is combined with the qualitative component to arrive at the loss factor, which is applied to the outstanding balance of homogenous loans. 
 During the first nine months of 2016, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $3.9 million. This recognition was primarily due to the growth of the loan portfolio and a loss recognized on a commercial real estate loan, partially offset by improvements in qualitative factors.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company determined that an impairment charge to a specific loan was required. After a review of one long-held nonresidential commercial real estate loan, the Company concluded that this loan had become impaired because the borrower is unlikely to perform its obligation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan.  The Company took a charge of $2.5 million in 2016 to write the loan down to fair value.  In addition, a specific reserve was established to cover probable costs.    
 A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that the collection of the full amount of principal and interest is no longer probable. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $40.3 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $39.7 million at December 31, 2015.  
 56 

Included in impaired loans above are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty, that it would otherwise not co  nsider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. If the debtor is not currently experiencing financial difficulties, but would probably be in payment default in the future without th  e modification, then this type of restructure also could be considered a TDR.   
 TDR loans aggregated $28.0 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $26.3 million at December 31, 2015.  Of the $28.0 million at September 30, 2016, $21.1 million were performing loans according to their modified terms.  The remaining balance of TDR loans of $6.9 million were considered nonperforming.   
 Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $19.4 million, or 1.32% of net loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to $16.7 million, or 1.27% of net loans, at December 31, 2015.  
 Loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $378,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2015.  Loans held for sale, carried at fair value, were $60.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $26.7 million at December 31, 2015. The change was primarily attributable to the originations of permanent construction loans during the period.  These loans are not sold until construction of the residence is complete, which is usually within nine to ten months of origination.  Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016, Home Savings elected the fair value option for all newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans held for sale.  Home Savings continues to sell a majority of its newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as part of its risk management strategy and anticipates continuing to do so in the future.  
 Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $934,000, or 34.3%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Real estate owned and other repossessed assets are recorded at the fair market value of the property less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on real estate properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. A valuation allowance may be established on any property to properly reflect the asset at fair value.   
 Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $1.5 million during the first nine months of 2016, due to the completion of the purchase of James   Sons Insurance Company announced on January 29, 2016.    
 Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings  policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.1 million, as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Other assets decreased $9.1 million, largely due to the change in net deferred tax assets (DTA) during the first nine months of 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the net DTA was $9.9 million, compared to $20.4 million at December 31, 2015.  This decrease in deferred tax assets was offset partially by Home Savings investment related to low-income housing aggregating $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2016.    
 Total deposits increased $37.3 million to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015.  Non-interest bearing accounts increased $25.4 million, or 11.2%.  During the same period, interest-bearing deposits increased $11.9 million, which can be attributed to Home Savings  continued efforts in attracting public funds.  As of September 30, 2016, Home Savings had $115.3 million in public funds.  As of December 31, 2015, Home Savings had $91.3 million in public funds.         
 FHLB advances increased from $279.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $405.6 million at September 30, 2016.  The change was due to an increase in overnight advances to help fund the growth of the balance sheet.  
 Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance decreased $6.4 million during the first nine months of 2016. Remittance of real estate taxes and property insurance made on behalf of customers of Home Savings accounted for $2.1 million of the decrease. In addition, funds held for payments received on loans sold where servicing was retained by Home Savings decreased $4.3 million in the same period.  
 57 

Shareholders  equity increased $12.2 million to $256.  4 million at September 30, 2016   from $244.2 million at December 31, 2015. Durin  g the first nine months of the year, regular earnings and an increase in other comprehensive income   (loss)   of $9.0 million as a result of changes in the value of available for sale securities contributed to the increase. The Company continued its common sh  are repurchase program, purchasing approximately 1.  6   million shares having a cost of $9.6 million.  During the first nine months of the year, the Company paid dividends of $3.8 million.  Also affecting the change, the Company issued 262,705 shares for the   purchase of James   Sons Insurance.   
 Book value per common share as of September 30, 2016 was $5.51 as compared to $5.14 per common share as of December 31, 2015. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as mentioned above.  
 Material Changes in Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended 
 September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
 Net Income.  United Community recognized net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, of $5.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share compared to net income of $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, or $0.09 per diluted share.   
 The increase in earnings for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the same quarter last year, was primarily a result of higher net interest income and higher noninterest income, which was partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses and higher non-interest expenses.    
 Net Interest Income.  Net interest income was $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2016 up from the $14.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015.  Net interest margin was 3.25% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 3.18% in the third quarter of 2015.   
 Total interest income increased by $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, to $17.8 million from $16.7 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale.  Average net loans increased $173.0 million in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2015. Offsetting this growth, the yield on average net loans declined 18 basis points to 4.12% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.30% for the same period in 2015.  Interest income from net loans increased to $14.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.4 million for the same period in 2015, and income from loans held for sale increased to $482,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $390,000 for the same period in 2015.   
 Interest expense decreased by $298,000 in the third quarter of 2016 to $2.1 million compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was due to a twelve basis point decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to the prepayment of a repurchase agreement in the fourth quarter of 2015. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Expenses on FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings were $661,000 and $5,000 respectively in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $340,000 and $323,000 respectively for the same period in 2015.   
 58 

The following table shows the impact of interest rate and outstanding balance (volume) changes   on tax equivalent interest income and expense   compared to the third quarter of   2015  . The interest rate spread for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was 3.14 % and 3.06%, respectively. The net interest margin increased seven basis points to 3.25% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.18% for the sam  e period in 2015.   

Provision for Loan Losses.  A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management s evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $673,000 in the third quarter of 2015.  The increase in provision expense during the third quarter of 2016 was driven by strong loan growth.  For the third quarter of 2016, net chargeoffs to average outstanding loans was eight basis points on an annualized basis.  This compares to two basis points for the same period in 2015.  
 Noninterest Income.  Non-interest income was $6.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2015.  Favorably impacting the change was the benefit of insurance agency income of $451,000 coupled with a 14.5% increase in mortgage banking income along with a 30.1% increase in brokerage income.  The Company also recognized security gains of $218,000 in the quarter as the investment portfolio is realigned to include higher-yielding municipal securities.  Offsetting these gains was a decrease in debit/credit card fees of $121,000.          
 Noninterest Expense.  Non-interest expense was $13.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, which represented an increase of $693,000, or 5.6%, from the third quarter of 2015.  Included in this increase were expenses of $432,000 related to the operation of the insurance agency acquired in January 2016.  The efficiency ratio continues to show improvement at 59.40% for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 63.54% in the same period in 2015.  
 59 

Income Taxes  . Duri  ng the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a tax expense of $2.  3   million on pre-tax income of $7.4 million, compared to a tax expense of $2.1 million on pre-tax income of $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    The primary reason for the variance was higher pre-tax income.   The reduction in the Company s effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in municipal securities that are expempt from federal taxation.  
 Material Changes in Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended 
 September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
 Net Income.  United Community recognized net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of $13.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, or $0.24 per diluted share.   
 The 15.5% increase in earnings for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same period last year, was primarily a result of higher net interest income due to loan growth, the positive impact of the prepayment of a repurchase agreement and higher non-interest income.  These increases were offset partially by a higher provision for loan losses and higher non-interest expenses.      
 Net Interest Income.  Net interest income was $46.0 million in the first nine months of 2016 up from the $42.0 million recorded in the first nine months of 2015.  Net interest margin increased four basis points to 3.23% for the first nine of 2016 compared to 3.19% in the first nine months of 2015.   
 Total interest income increased by $3.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, to $52.2 million from $48.8 million. The increase is a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale, offset by lower yields received on these balances.  Average net loans increased $177.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and yields declined 21 basis points to 4.13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.34% for the same period in 2015. Average loans held for sale increased $7.7 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, while yields declined to 3.86% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the same period in 2015. Interest income from net loans increased to $42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2015, and income from loans held for sale increased to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2015.  These increases were partially offset by a decline of $353,000 in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities. 
 Interest expense decreased by $500,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to $6.3 million compared to $6.8 million during the same period in 2015. This decrease was due to a ten basis point decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in the first nine of 2016 primarily due to the prepayment of a repurchase agreement in the fourth quarter of 2015. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $4.5 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $4.9 million in the first nine months of 2015.  Expenses on FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings were $1.8 million and $16,000 respectively in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $947,000 and $958,000 respectively for the same period in 2015.   
 60 

The following table shows the impact of interest rate a  nd outstanding balance (volume) changes   on tax equivalent interest income and expense   compared to the first nine months of   2015  . The interest rate spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was 3.13 % and 3.07%, respectively. The net int  erest margin increased four basis points to 3.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.19% for the same period in 2015.   

Provision for Loan Losses.  A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management s evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $3.9 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $1.2 million in the first nine months of 2015.  The increase in provision expense during the first nine months of 2016 was driven by strong loan growth.  Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $2.5 million during 2016, related to one long-held nonresidential commercial real estate loan.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net chargeoffs to average outstanding loans was 33 basis points on an annualized basis.  This compares to 16 basis points for the same period in 2015.  
 Noninterest Income.  Non-interest income was $16.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $14.3 million in the comparable period in 2015.  Positively impacting the comparison was the benefit of insurance agency income totaling $1.3 million.  Also contributing to the change was an increase of 7.7% of deposit related fees along with an increase of 29.3% in brokerage income and a 5.0% increase in debit/credit card fees, for a total of $668,000.  The first nine months also saw security gains totaling $604,000.  These increases were partially offset by a $702,000 negative valuation adjustment of mortgage servicing rights.  
 Noninterest Expense.  Non-interest expense was $38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which represented an increase of $1.1 million, or 3.0%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As in the quarter to quarter comparison, the acquisition of the insurance company and its operating expenses to date of $948,000 negatively affected the current nine months.  Also affecting the comparison, equipment and data processing charges increased $543,000 and Financial Institutions Tax increased $360,000.  The efficiency ratio was 61.28% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 65.58% for the same period in 2015.  
 61 

Income Taxes  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a tax expense of $6.4 million on pre-tax income of $20.2 million, compared to a tax expense of $5.9 million on pre-tax income of $17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,   2015.  The primary reason for the variance was higher pre-tax income offset by the Company s investment in non-taxable municipal securities.   
 Liquidity 
 United Community's liquidity, primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a result of its operating, investing and financing activities.  
 The principal sources of funds for United Community are deposits, loan repayments, maturities of securities, borrowings from financial institutions, repurchase agreements and other funds provided by operations.  Home Savings also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank.  While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and early loan prepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition.  Investments in liquid assets maintained by United Community and Home Savings are based upon management's assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on short-term liquid assets, and (4) objectives of the asset and liability management program.  At September 30, 2016, approximately $248.5 million of Home Savings  certificates of deposit were expected to mature within one year.  Based on past experience and Home Savings  prevailing pricing strategies, management believes that a substantial percentage of such certificates will be renewed with Home Savings at maturity, although there can be no assurance that this will occur. 
 Home Savings  Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity guidelines, policies and procedures.  ALCO uses a variety of methods to monitor the liquidity position of Home Savings including a liquidity analysis that measures potential sources and uses of funds over future time periods out to one year.  ALCO also performs contingency funding analyses to determine Home Savings  ability to meet potential liquidity needs under stress scenarios that cover varying time horizons ranging from immediate to long-term. 
 At September 30, 2016, United Community had total on-hand liquidity, defined as cash and cash equivalents, unencumbered securities and additional FHLB borrowing capacity, of $466.5 million.

ITEM 3. Quantita    tive and Qualitativ  e Disclosures About Market Risk.   
 Qualitative Aspects of Market Risk.  The principal market risk affecting United Community is interest rate risk. United Community is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of United Community s earnings and net asset values to changes in interest rates. As part of its efforts to monitor and manage the interest rate risk, the Board of Directors of Home Savings has adopted an interest rate risk policy that requires the Home Savings Board to review quarterly reports related to interest rate risk and to annually set exposure limits for Home Savings as a guide to management in setting and implementing day to day operating strategies.   
 Quantitative Aspects of Market Risk.  As part of its interest rate risk analysis, Home Savings uses the net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income methodology. Generally, NPV is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities. The application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the NPV and net interest income that would result from various levels of theoretical basis point changes in market interest rates.   
 Home Savings uses an NPV and earnings simulation model prepared internally as its primary method to identify and manage its interest rate risk profile. The model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future volumes and the prepayment rate of applicable financial instruments. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates also are incorporated into the model. These assumptions inherently are uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot measure precisely NPV or net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.  
 Presented below are analyses of Home Savings  interest rate risk as measured by changes in NPV and net interest income for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of 100 basis point increments in market interest rates.  As noted, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the percentage changes fall within the policy limits set by the Board of Directors of Home Savings as the minimum NPV ratio and the maximum change in interest income the Home Savings Board deems advisable in the event of various changes in interest rates. See the table below for Board adopted policy limits.  

Due to a low interest rate environment, it was not meaningful to calculate results for a drop in interest rates.  
 65 

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the above approach. For example, although certain assets and liabilities m  ay have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, w  hile interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayment on loans and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit may deviate significantly from th  ose assumed in making risk calculations.   
 Potential Impact of Changes in Interest Rates . Home Savings  profitability depends to a large extent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and securities and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Like most financial institutions, Home Savings  short-term interest income and interest expense are affected significantly by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond its control.   
     ITEM 4. Con  trols and Procedures.  
 An evaluation was carried out by United Community s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of United Community s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)/15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2016. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that United Community s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that United Community files or submits under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, including those controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including United Community s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in United Community s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect United Community s internal control over financial reporting.

   (b) All of the shares of Seller Common Stock converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Seller Common Stock (each, an   Old C  ertificate   it being understood that any reference herein to an   Old Certificate   shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry accounts evidencing ownership of shares of Seller Common Stock, and certificates for or book-entry accounts evidencing Seller Preferred Stock in the case of Deemed Converted Common Stock) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6(a), 2.1 and 2.2, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares that the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.6 and Section 2.4(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b).

 3 

and/or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, upon the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.4, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Seller Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Seller Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.  
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all Excluded Shares (other than the Exception Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 
 (d) Each Series A Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to have been converted into the number of shares of Seller Common Stock as would be issuable upon a voluntary conversion of such Series A Preferred Share in accordance with Section 8 of Division A-1 of the Seller Articles (the   Deemed Converted Common Stock  ). Each share of Deemed Converted Common Stock shall be converted into the Merger Consideration exactly as though it were a share of outstanding Seller Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.6(a) and Article II. 
 (e) Each outstanding share of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock, the holder of which has complied with all requirements under OGCL Section 1701.85 to be entitled to relief as a dissenting shareholder and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters   rights as of the Effective Time (the   Dissenting Shares  ), will not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof will be entitled solely to the rights granted by applicable law.  Seller will give Parent prompt notice upon receipt by Seller of any demand for payment of the fair cash value of shares of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock and of withdrawals of demand for payment and any other related communications (any shareholder duly making a demand being hereinafter called a   Dissenting Shareholder  ).  Parent may participate in all discussions, negotiations, and proceedings relating to a demand for payment of the fair cash value of shares of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock.  Except with advance written consent of Parent, Seller will not voluntarily make any payment on, settle or offer to settle a demand for payment, or waive a failure of timely delivery of a written demand for payment of fair cash value or of the taking of any other action by the Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect dissenting shareholders  rights under applicable law. Except for payments prior to the Effective Time consented to by Parent, any payments made for Dissenting Shares will be made by the Surviving Corporation. 
   (f) If at or before the Effective Time, whether through failure to comply with applicable requirements or otherwise, a Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or loses the right to payment, the Dissenting Shareholder s Dissenting Shares will be converted into

the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.  If after the Effective Time of the Merger, whether through failure to comply with applicable requirements or otherwise, a Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or loses the right to payment, such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion.  
   (g) If Seller s Effective Time Book Value is less than $32,648,835 (the   Target Number  ), then (i) each of (A) the Cash Consideration component of the Merger Consideration, payable with respect to each share of Seller Common Stock (including shares subject to Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards and shares of Deemed Converted Stock) that is eligible to receive Cash Consideration; and (B) the amount payable with respect to each share of Seller Common Stock subject to a Seller Stock Option shall be reduced by a per share amount (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing one-half of the dollar amount of the Shortage by 2,265,750 (which is as of the date of this Agreement the number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding (including shares subject to Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards and shares of Deemed Converted Stock) plus the number of unissued shares of Seller Common Stock potentially issuable under the Seller Stock Options); and (ii) the Stock Consideration for each share of Seller Common Stock (including shares subject to Seller Restricted Stock Units Awards and shares of Deemed Converted Stock) that is eligible to receive Stock Consideration shall be reduced by a number of shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) one half of the dollar amount of the Shortage divided by $6.67 by (B) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock (including shares subject to Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards and shares of Deemed Converted Stock) that are eligible to receive Stock Consideration.  For purposes of this subparagraph (g),   Effective Time Book Value   shall be calculated as the estimated shareholders  equity of Seller plus allowance for loan and lease losses (the   Allowance  ) as of the end of the month prior to the Effective Time determined in accordance with GAAP to the reasonable satisfaction of both Parent and Seller no earlier than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date  and which shall reflect an Allowance calculated in a manner consistent with Seller s historical practices.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the calculation of    Effective Time Book Value    shall  be exclusive of the following:  any changes in accumulated other comprehensive income since June 30, 2016, and to the extent, and only to the extent, related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) fees and expenses (including reimbursable expenses) payable to Sandler O Neill   Partners L.P. as provided in Section 3.7, (ii) all professional fees and expenses of legal counsel and accountants, (iii) expenses of calling and holding the Seller Meeting (including printing and mailing costs), (iv) termination expenses, conversion costs and penalty costs associated with vendor contracts and/or commitments to which Seller or Seller Bank is a party or otherwise bound that Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent does not intend to continue after the Effective Time, including data processing contracts and commitments, (v) filing fees and costs, (vi) any costs or expenses required to be incurred by Seller or Seller Bank by an express provision of this Agreement or otherwise incurred at the request of Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent, (vii) expenses, costs, payments to terminate change in control agreements, retention bonuses or similar payments, severance obligations and plan continuation costs pursuant to Sections 6.6(b), (c), (d) and (e), and (viii) other merger

For avoidance of doubt, any expense or liability related to the di  sclosure set forth in Section   3.7   of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be considered in the calculation of Seller s Effective Time Book Value.     Shortage    means the amount by which the Effective Time Book Value is less than the Target Number, but in no event shall the Sh  ortage be greater than $200,000   unless a greater amount (not to exceed   $750,000   is approved by the board of directors of Seller   in its sole discretion  .  
    1.7   Treatment of Seller Equity Awards.  
 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Seller to purchase shares of Seller Common Stock under the Seller Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a   Seller Stock Option  ) will be cancelled and will instead represent solely the right to receive in cash from Parent the amount by which $18.00 per share exceeds the exercise or strike price of such Seller Stock Option. The number and terms of Seller Stock Options will not exceed or differ from the number and terms disclosed in Seller Disclosure Schedule 1.7(a).  If the exercise price of a Seller Stock Option equals or exceeds $18.00, such Seller Stock Option will be cancelled without any payment in exchange. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Seller Stock Options within five business days after the Effective Time a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for surrendering the Seller Stock Options.

 (b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Seller Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase, lapse or other restriction granted under the Seller Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a   Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award  ) shall fully vest and shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 based on the holder s election in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 2.1 and 2.2 and treating the shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award in the same manner as all other shares of Seller Common Stock for such purposes. Parent shall pay or issue the consideration described in this Section 1.7(b) promptly, and in any event within five (5) business days following the Effective Time. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award all such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with such amounts, if any, first being deducted from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, due to such holder.

    1.11   Bank Merger.  
 Subject to Section 6.13, immediately following the Merger Seller Bank will merge with and into Parent Bank (the   Bank Merger  ) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, the form of which is attached hereto as  Exhibit C  (the   Bank Merger Agreement  ). Subject to Section 6.13, Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Seller Bank shall cease.

(i)   
 
 If the aggregate number of shares of Seller Common Stock (including shares subject to Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Exception Shares and Deemed Converted Common Stock) with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been made (the   Cash Election Number  ) exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.1(a), whether fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder s Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and     

(ii)   
 
 If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election Number being referred to herein as the   Shortfall Number  ), then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down),  with the remaining number of such holder s Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or      

(B)   
 
 If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such holder s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.     

         2.2  Election Procedures.  
 Each holder of record of shares of Seller Common Stock, Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Exception Shares and Deemed Converted Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, Sections 1.6(a) and 2.1 (a   Holder  ) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2 (herein called an   Election  ) (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock, Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Exception Shares and Deemed Converted Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock, Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Exception Shares and Deemed Converted Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

 (a) Parent (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election not less than thirty (30) business days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder who requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the   Election Period  .  
 (b) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States.

The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than twenty (20) business days before, and at least ten (10) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

All Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Seller Common Stock (none of Parent, Seller nor the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Seller Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable or the amount of payments due under Section 1.7(a).

Until surrendered as contemplated by Sections 2.2 and 2.4, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.4.  
 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until such Holder shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II.  After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, that theretofore had become payable with respect to the Stock Consideration that the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. 
 (c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 
 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Seller of the shares of Seller Common Stock or Seller Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this Article II. 
   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent; provided that, when determining the fractional shares to be cashed out, all resulting fractional shares held by the same Holder shall, to the extent practicable, be combined into the greatest number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock as possible, and thereafter the holder shall receive cash in lieu of  
 12 

any remaining fractional share. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of Seller who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) $6.67 by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6 and subject to Section 2.1.    
 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Seller for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Seller Common Stock, Seller Restricted Stock Unit Award, Exception Share or Deemed Converted Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Seller, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Seller Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 
 (g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Common Stock, Deemed Converted Common Stock, Exception Shares, Seller Stock Options or Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards (Seller Stock Options and Seller Restricted Stock Unit Awards being referred to as the   Seller Equity Awards  ) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Seller Common Stock, Deemed Converted Common Stock, Exception Shares or Seller Equity Award in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 
 (h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (j) There are no pending or, to Seller s knowledge, threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to Seller s knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Seller Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Seller Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Seller Benefit Plans that would, in any case, reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Seller Benefit Plan or any other party.

 (m) No Seller Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or Seller or their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in this Section 6.1 that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in each case, measured on a scale relative to Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a    Materiall        y Burdensome Regulatory Condition   ).  
 (d) Parent and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Seller agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed or becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of Seller s meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading and (iii) any statement, filing, notice or application filed with any Governmental Entities to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will contain, at the time each is filed, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of Parent and Seller further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement. 
   (e) Parent and Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party  
 54 

to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.  
    6.2   Access to Information.  
 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and Seller, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, each of Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request.  Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other party s regular business operations during any such access. Neither Parent nor Seller nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Parent s or Seller s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will attempt in good faith to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 
 (b) Each of Parent and Seller shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated February 19, 2016, between Parent and Seller (the   Confidentiality Agreement  ). 
 (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein, except to the extent it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the investigating party had knowledge of the specific breach of the representation or warranty in question prior to the date of this Agreement.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries  respective operations. 
 55 

(d)     Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide data processing, item processing and other processing support to assist in performing all tasks reasonably required and requested by Parent to result in a successful conversion of the data and other files and records of Seller and its Subsidiaries to Parent s production environment (the    Conv        ersion   ), in such a manner sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that a successful Conversion will occur at, as may be elected in writing by Parent to Seller after the date hereof and prior to filing the application for approval of the Merger and the Bank Merger from the Federal Reserve Board, (x) the time that is immediately following the Merger and the Bank Merger (such an election in this clause (x), a    Sim        ultaneous Conversion Election   ) or (y) such later date as may be specified by Parent, in each case, subject to any applicable laws, including laws regarding the exchange of information and other laws regarding competition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall, subject to any such applicable laws: (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a project plan as specified by Parent to effectuate the Conversion; (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have Seller s outside contractors continue to support at Parent s expense, both the Conversion effort and Seller s incremental Conversion needs until the Conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by Parent, at Parent s expense, for use in planning the Conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to Seller s personnel and facilities and, with the consent of its outside contractors and at Parent s expense, its outside contractors  personnel and facilities, to the extent necessary to enable the Conversion effort to be completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are bound if requested to do so by Parent to the extent permitted by such contracts;   provided  , that Seller shall not be required to take any action that would prejudice or adversely affect in any material respect its rights under any such contracts in the event the Closing does not occur. Parent shall promptly reimburse Seller for any reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the actions described in this Section 6.2(d).   
    6.3   Seller Shareholder Approval.  
 (a) Subject to Section 6.11, Seller shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Seller Articles and Seller Regulations, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the   Seller Meeting  ) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Seller Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. Subject to Section 6.11, the Board of Directors of Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Seller the Requisite Seller Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
 56 

(b)     Subject to Section 6.11  , Seller shall adjourn or postpone the Seller Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Seller has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Seller Vote;   provided  , that Seller shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the Seller Meeting more than two times pursuant to this Section 6.3(b).   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,   including in accordance with Section 6.11,   the Seller Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Seller at the Seller Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Seller of such obligation.  
   6.4  Legal Conditions to Merger.  
 Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 of this Agreement, each of Parent and Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Seller or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
    6.5   Stock Exchange Listing.  
 Parent shall take all steps necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 
    6.6   Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.  
 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable good faith efforts to minimize the impact of the Merger and the Bank Merger on employees of Seller and Seller Bank, consistent with Parent s and Parent Bank s plans for the operations of the business of the combined entities following the Effective Time;  provided, however , that this Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent or Parent Bank to close a branch or terminate the employment of any employee. Parent and Parent Bank will offer Seller Bank employees whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the Bank Merger priority in applying for open positions within Parent and Parent Bank.  
   (b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which any employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the   New Plans  ), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing  
 57 

conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Seller Benefit Plan, (ii) to the extent   permitted by the New Plans and   commercially practicable, provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or co-insurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Seller Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, co-insurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Seller and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;   provided   that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.  
 (c) With regard to the employment, change in control or other severance agreements that are identified in Seller Disclosure Schedule 6.6(c), Parent will pay to each employee identified on Seller Disclosure Schedule 6.6(c) the amount set forth beside his or her name thereon in a single lump sum at the Effective Time in exchange for the termination of such agreement, without regard to any such employee s continued employment by Parent following the Effective Time. The estimated amounts payable under the employment and change in control severance agreements are stated in Seller Disclosure Schedule 6.6(c).  Despite anything in this Agreement to the contrary, however, the Surviving Corporation is not required to make and the Surviving Corporation will not make a payment that would constitute a  parachute payment  (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 280G and Internal Revenue Service implementing regulations).  If a payment would constitute a parachute payment, the payment will be reduced to one dollar less than the amount beyond which the payment would be considered a parachute payment.  
   (d) Excluding any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries who is a party to an employment, change-in-control, or other agreement identified in Seller Disclosure Schedule 6.6(c) that provides for severance payments, all of whom will receive payments at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 6.6(c), Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay severance as provided in this Section 6.6(d) to any person who is an employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time but whose employment does not continue with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time or whose employment is terminated within one year after the Effective Time, excluding any employee terminated for cause.  As a condition to entitlement to severance pay, employees must execute appropriate release of claims and confidentiality documents.  For purposes of this provision, cause means termination because of material neglect of or material refusal to perform any duty or responsibility as an employee other than as a result of sickness, accident, or similar cause beyond an employee s reasonable control, dishonesty, commission of a crime (other than minor traffic violations), or misconduct.   
 58 

Severance under this Section 6.6(d) is two (2) week of base pay for each full year of service (including service with Seller, Parent, or a Subsidiary of either), with a minimum of eight (8) weeks and a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay. For purposes of this provision, base pay means base salary before pre-tax deductions for a salaried employee, and for an hourly employee the employee s total scheduled hours (prorated, as appropriate) before any pre-tax deductions for the 12 full calendar months preceding the month in which the Effective Time occurs.  Severance payments pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be made as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the later to occur of (a) employee s termination or (b) the date employee has executed Parent s standard severance and release agreement.  In addition to severance under this Section 6.6(d), the Surviving Corporation may pay retention or other incentive bonuses to employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries identified by Parent after consulting with Seller, as critical to data processing or other transition tasks or who are otherwise determined by Parent to be key officers or employees.  Retention bonuses may have a vesting term of up to one year, with bonus forfeiture occurring for termination before vesting.  Retention bonuses, if any, would be in addition to any bonus for which any former officer or employee or Seller or its Subsidiaries may be eligible as an employee of the Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank.  
 (e) Seller shall either continue Seller s 401(k) plan(s) or if, and only if, requested by Parent in writing not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall take all actions as are necessary, including the adoption of Board of Directors or compensation committee resolutions or consents, to terminate Seller s 401(k) plan(s), effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time, with such termination to be subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior to taking any such action, Seller shall provide Parent with a copy of such resolutions or consent in connection with such plan termination, and shall consider any comments provided by Parent in good faith. Parent shall cause the 401(k) plans of Parent or its Affiliates to accept as soon as practicable rollover distributions from current and former employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to such individuals  account balances (including loans), if elected by any such individuals. 
   (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, Seller, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Seller, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Seller Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Seller Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of  
 59 

Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.  
    6.7   Indemnification; Directors  and Officers  Insurance.  
 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of Seller and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the   Seller Indemnified Parties  ) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or  omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law;  provided  that the Seller Indemnified Party to whom  expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Seller Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.  
 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance maintained by Seller ( provided , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);  provided, however , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 150% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Seller for such insurance (the   Premium Cap  ), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Seller, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent, may (and at the request of Parent, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year  tail  policy under Seller s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap, which policy Parent shall not cancel or terminate for any reason. Seller will terminate all indemnification agreements prior to the Effective Time. 
 60 

(c)     The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall   be   enforceable by, each Seller Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then, in each such case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   
 (d) Following the Effective Time, the obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Seller under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Seller Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the affected Seller Indemnified Party. 
    6.8   Non-Renewal of Agreements.  
 Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent and Seller will confer in good faith in an effort to identify (i) any agreements of Seller or Seller Bank that should be terminated as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) when and how those agreements should be terminated. 
          6.9         Advice of Changes.  
 Parent and Seller shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII;  provided , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change, event or circumstance would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied. 
    6.10   Board Member; Community Contribution.  
 (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall increase by one the number of members of its Board of Directors and shall elect Louis M. Altman as a member of the Parent Board of Directors, and (ii) Parent Bank shall increase by one the number of members of its Board of Directors and shall elect Louis M. Altman as a member of the Parent Bank Board of Directors. 
 (b) During the five years following the Effective Time Parent will use reasonable efforts consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations and consistent with the legal status of the Home Savings and Loan Foundation (the   Foundation  ) to cause the distribution committee of the Foundation to contribute at least a total of $500,000 to community organizations and charities within the communities in which Seller serves. 
 61 

6.11     Acquisition Proposals.  
 (a) From August 2, 2016 to the date hereof, Seller has, and has caused its Representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before August 2, 2016 with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date hereof, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively,   Representatives  ) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal.   
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 6.11(a), in the event that, after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Requisite Seller Vote, Seller receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries  Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data, participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably capable of becoming, a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.  Prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.11(b), Seller shall have provided such information to Parent, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to Seller than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Seller. 
 (c) Seller will promptly (and in any event within one (1) business days) advise Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within one (1) business days) advise Parent of any related developments, discussions and negotiations, including any amendments to, or revisions of, the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.  Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. 
 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Vote, Seller may accept or approve a Superior Proposal, cancel or delay the Seller Meeting, change or withdraw its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and/or terminate this Agreement;  provided , that the Seller s Board of Directors may not do any of the foregoing unless:  

(i)   
 
   the Board of Directors of Seller has concluded in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel, and with respect     

 62 

to financial matters, its financial advisor) that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to accept such Superior Proposal would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, after taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement agreed to or proposed by Parent;      

(ii)   
 
 Seller shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance (the   Notice Period  ) of taking such action, which notice shall advise Parent that the Seller has received a Superior Proposal, and specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the person or group making the Superior Proposal);     

(iii)   
 
 during the Notice Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and     

(iv)   
 
 the Seller s Board of Directors shall have concluded in good faith (after consultation with Seller s financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that, after considering the results of such negotiations, if any, and after giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications offered or agreed to by Parent, if any, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.    

 (e) Other than pursuant to this Section 6.11, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.  
 (f) As used in this Agreement: 

(i)   
 
     Acquisition Proposal   shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, or proposal relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (A) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Seller or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller, (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Seller or its Subsidiaries     

 63 

whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller, or (C) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving Seller or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller.     

(ii)   
 
   Superior Proposal   means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms which the Seller Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Seller s outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, and taking into account all the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including execution risk and risks as to certainty and timing of consummation, the interests of Seller Bank s employees and customers, and community and societal considerations, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders of Seller Common Stock than the terms of this Agreement (in each case, taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed by Parent);  provided  that for purposes of the definition of  Superior Proposal,  the references to  25% or more  in the definition of Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be references to  50% or more.     

 64 

6.12     Public Announcements.  
 Seller and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, Seller and Parent agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 
    6.13   Change of Method.  
 Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger and the Bank Merger (including by providing for the merger of Parent Bank with and into Seller Bank) if and to the extent requested by Parent, and Seller agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring;  provided, however , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Seller s shareholders or causes the Merger to no longer qualify as a  reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed, (iv) otherwise adversely affect the holders of Seller Common Stock. 
    6.14   Restructuring Efforts.  
 (a) Subject to Section 6.11, if Seller shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Seller Vote at the duly convened Seller Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (other than in circumstances addressed in Section 6.14(b)), each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (provided, however, that no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to Seller s shareholders) and/or (in the case of Seller) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.14(a)) to its shareholders for adoption. 
   (b) Subject to Section 6.11, if Seller shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Seller Vote at the duly convened Seller Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof solely because of the failure to obtain the requisite vote of the holders of Seller Preferred Stock then, if so requested by Parent, (i) each of the parties shall restructure the transaction provided for herein such that each holder of Seller Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, in lieu of the Merger Consideration, a number of preferred shares of Parent equal to the number of shares of Seller Preferred Stock held by such holder and having express terms identical in all material respects to those of the Series A Preferred Shares of Seller so as to meet the standards of Section 1701.78(F) of the Ohio Revised Code under which a merger agreement need not be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of a particular class voting separately as a class, (ii) the definition of Requisite Seller Vote shall  
 65 

be modified accordingly, and (iii) Seller shall resubmit this Agreement (as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.14(b)) to the Seller s shareholders for adoption.  
          6.15         Takeover Statutes.  
 Neither Parent nor Seller shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Parent and Seller shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and Seller will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute in any litigation initiated by a third party either directly or derivatively. 
   6.16  Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).  
 Parent shall take all steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by Article I and Article II and any other acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by any insiders of Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 
   6.17  Litigation and Claims.  
 Each of Parent and Seller shall promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Seller, as applicable, threatened against Parent, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Seller shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against Seller and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parent s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 (b) by either Parent or Seller if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 
 69 

(c)     by either Parent or Seller if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June 30, 2017 (the    Termina        tion Date   ), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein  ;     provided  ,   however  , that if the failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3(d) hereof is the sole reason for not consummating the Merger, Seller may not exercise its right to termination under this Section 8.1(c) until it has provided at least 15 business days  prior notice to Parent of its intent to terminate  ;   
 (d) by Parent ( provided , that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of Seller, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by Seller (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 and that is not cured by the earlier of the Termination Date and the date that is 45 days following written notice to Seller, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period;

 (b)  

(i)   
 
 In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of Seller or shall have been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Seller and (x) (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Seller Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (y) prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the date of such termination, Seller enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Seller shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $1,625,000 (the   Termination Fee  ).    

(ii)   
 
   In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then Seller shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the

 (c) Each of Parent and Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against Seller for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Seller shall pay the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Seller fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then Seller shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the  prime rate  (as announced by JPMorgan Chase   Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful material misconduct, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in (a) Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each Seller Indemnified Party and his or her heir and representatives, (b) Section 6.6(c), which is intended to benefit, to the extent expressly provided therein, each employee of Seller that is a party to an employment, change in control or other severance agreement, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 
   9.12  Specific Performance.  
 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties  obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 
   9.13  Severability.  
 Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 
 76 

9.14   Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission.  
 This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file or other image file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file or other image file, to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a .pdf format data file or other image file, as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense. 
   9.15  Further Assurances.  
 In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Seller, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.
