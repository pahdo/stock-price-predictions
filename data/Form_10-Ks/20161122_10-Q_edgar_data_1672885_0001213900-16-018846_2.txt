NOTE
1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

NATURE
OF OPERATIONS  

Doers
Education Asean Ltd. (formerly Collins Island Acquisition Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated on April 4,
2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected
mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been
limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to
be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION  

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s unaudited condensed
financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company s
management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied
in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results for the period from April
4, 2016 (Inception) to September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and cash equivalents include cash
on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of
90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $64 as of September 30, 2016. 

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK  

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.  

INCOME
TAXES  

Under
ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were
no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.  

LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE  

Basic
loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized
and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  

  The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly.  

Level
3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while
maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred
tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this
Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred
tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by
the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application
is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process
of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company s
financial statements would be insignificant.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows . The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or
Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made
after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned
Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees;
(8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance
Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should
be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively
for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory ,
which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when
the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under
Common Control . The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate
a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change
the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting
entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related
parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN  

The Company has not yet generated any
revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating loss of $6,356 during the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to
September 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,936 and an accumulated deficit of $6,356 as of September 30,
2016. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of
liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

In
order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from
operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its
current level of operations.  

NOTE
3  - ACCRUED LIABILITIES  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had an accrued professional fee of $2,000. 

NOTE
4  - DUE TO  RELATED PARTY  

Due to related party amounted to $2,500
as of September 30, 2016 are fees paid by a shareholder on behalf of the Company. 

NOTE
5  - STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT  

On
April 4, 2016, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock to two directors and officers. The Company is authorized to
issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, 20,640,000 shares
of common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding.  

On
July 24, 2016, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 19,500,000 of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock at a redemption
price of $.0001 per share.  

On
July 25, 2016, the Company issued 19,500,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
at par representing 97.5% of the total outstanding 19,000,000 shares of common stock to Wilson Lin Wei-Hsien and 500,000 shares
to Daz Mc Securities. Daz Mc Securities works with Khoo Lay Wah together as shareholders and management of the Company.  

On
September 30, 2016, the Company issued 640,000 shares of its common stock to 38 shareholders for $64 at par value.  

NOTE
6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT  

Management has evaluated subsequent
events through November 19, 2016, the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring
recognition as of September 30, 2016 have been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no subsequent events
that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Doers
Education Asean Ltd. (formerly  Collins Island Acquisition Corporation ) was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the
laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and
acquisitions. Doers Education Asean Ltd. ( Doers  or the  Company ) is a blank check company and qualifies
as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April, 2012.  

Since
inception Doers  operations to date of the period covered by this report have been limited to issuing shares of common stock
to its original shareholders and filing a registration statement on Form10 on May 2, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended to register its class of common stock. Subsequent to the date covered
by this report, the Company effected a change of control. 

Doers
has no operations nor does it currently engage in any business activities generating revenues. Subsequent to the change of control
which occurred subsequent to the date covered by this report, the Company anticipates that it will effect a business combination
to develop its business plan focused on business education and development.  

A
combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances
the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  

No
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company anticipates
that it will be involved in the energy industry through acquisition of a private company or development of its business plan including
construction and development of hydro electric and coal fired steam power plants in Indonesia.  

As of September
30, 2016, Doers had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. Doers had sustained
net loss of $6,356 and an accumulated deficit of $6,356 for the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to September 30, 2016. 

The
Company s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial
support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully
locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.  

Management
pays all expenses incurred by Doers. There is no expectation of repayment for such expenses.

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosures
and Procedures  

Pursuant
to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of
the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive
officer (who is also the principal financial officer).  

Based
upon that evaluation, he believes that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering, analyzing
and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Quarterly Report.  

Changes
in Internal Controls  

There
was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with such evaluation
that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
