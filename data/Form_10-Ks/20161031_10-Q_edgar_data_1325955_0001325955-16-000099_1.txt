  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited, dollars in thousands except as noted) 
   
           (1) 
    Basis of Presentation    
     As used in this report, unless otherwise specified, the terms  Alon,   we,   our  and  us  or like terms refer to Alon USA Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or to Alon USA Energy, Inc. or an individual subsidiary. Generally, the words 
   we,   our  and  us  include Alon USA Partners, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries (the  Partnership ) as consolidated 
  subsidiaries of Alon USA Energy, Inc. unless when used in disclosures of transactions or obligations between the Partnership 
  and Alon USA Energy, Inc., or its other subsidiaries. 
  These consolidated financial statements and notes are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. 
  In the opinion of our management, the information included in these consolidated financial statements reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year balances may have been aggregated or disaggregated in order to conform to the current year presentation. Our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be realized for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Our consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  New Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts to provide goods or services to customers. This standard is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. In August 2015, the FASB updated the guidance to include a one-year deferral of the effective date for the new revenue standard, making the requirements of the standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the guidance to determine the method of adoption and the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance. The new standard changes the way certain decisions are made related to substantive rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the variable interest entity consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. We have adopted the updated guidance, effective January 1, 2016, with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update simplifying the measurement of certain inventory. This updated standard simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The amendments in this accounting standards update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This accounting standards update does not apply to the subsequent measurement of inventory measured using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or retail inventory method, therefore the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update simplifying the presentation of income taxes. This updated standard eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet. Instead, all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be classified as non-current. The requirements from the updated standard are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the guidance to determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the present value of the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The requirements from this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018. We are evaluating the guidance to determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which clarifies that for the purposes of applying hedge accounting for derivative transactions, a change in the counterparty to a derivative contract (through novation) that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify some provisions in stock compensation accounting. The areas for simplification of this update involve the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of the statement of cash flows. This update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update requiring the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The requirements from the updated standard are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the guidance to determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update addressing eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of eliminating the existing diversity in practice. The amendments from this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect application of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

    California Renewable Fuels Project    
     On March 1, 2016, we acquired control of the California renewable fuels project which initially provides for us to receive approximately   77%   of earnings and distributions of the project. We increased our original   32%   ownership and obtained control of the California renewable fuels project after certain operational milestones were achieved. We contributed to the project total cash in the amount of   $27,058  . 
  Our California renewable fuels project began operations in February 2016. The project converts approximately   2,500   barrels per day of tallow and other feedstocks into renewable fuels, which are replacements for petroleum-based fuel. Our California renewable fuels project generates environmental credits in the form of renewable identification numbers, low-carbon fuels standards credits and blender s tax credits, which are all recorded in net sales. 
  Acquisitions achieved in stages require that in the period the acquiring company achieves control, that it recognize 100% of the fair value of the net assets at that time. Additionally, the existing equity interests of the company and of non-controlling interest are required to be recorded at fair value. The fair value of the project was estimated by applying the market approach. Based on our analysis at March 1, 2016, there was   no   gain recorded for the revaluation of our previous equity interests. The fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded into our consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Beginning March 1, 2016, we have consolidated the California renewable fuels project as part of our refining and marketing segment in our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated statements of operations include the project s revenues of   $48,503   and   $99,176   and operating income of   $6,083   and   $13,003   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.

    Alon USA Partners, LP 
     The Partnership (NYSE: ALDW) is a publicly-traded limited partnership that owns the assets and conducts the operations of the Big Spring refinery and the associated integrated wholesale marketing operations. The limited partner interests of the Partnership are represented as common units outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016  , the   11,520,220   common units held by the public represent   18.4%   of the Partnership s common units outstanding. We own the remaining   81.6%   of the Partnership s common units and Alon USA Partners GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, owns   100%   of the general partner interest in the Partnership, which is a non-economic interest. 
  The limited partner interests in the Partnership not owned by us are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in net income attributable to non-controlling interest and in our consolidated balance sheets in non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. The Partnership is consolidated within the refining and marketing segment. 
  We have agreements with the Partnership, under which the Partnership has agreed to reimburse us for certain administrative and operational services provided by us and our subsidiaries to the Partnership, provide certain indemnification obligations and other matters and establish terms for the supply of products by the Partnership to us. 
  Partnership Distributions 
  The Partnership has adopted a policy pursuant to which it will distribute all of the available cash generated each quarter, as defined in the partnership agreement, subject to the approval of the board of directors of the General Partner. The per unit amount of available cash to be distributed each quarter, if any, will be distributed within 60 days following the end of such quarter. 
  The following table summarizes the Partnership s cash distribution activity during the period:

    Represents the aggregate cash available for distribution per unit attributable to the period indicated. This represents the difference between cash available for distribution and distributions paid in the table above. 
      
           (4) 
    Segment Data    
     Our revenues are derived from   three   operating segments: (i) refining and marketing, (ii) asphalt and (iii) retail. The reportable operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The segments are managed separately as each segment requires unique technology, marketing strategies and distinct operational emphasis. Each operating segment s performance is evaluated primarily based on operating income. 
  (a)  Refining and Marketing Segment 
  Our refining and marketing segment includes a sour crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas, a light sweet crude oil refinery located in Krotz Springs, Louisiana, and heavy crude oil refineries located in Paramount, Bakersfield and Long Beach, California (the  California refineries ). We refine crude oil into petroleum products including various grades of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, petrochemical feedstocks, asphalt and other petroleum-based products, which are marketed primarily in the South Central, Southwestern and Western regions of the United States. We are also shipping and selling gasoline into wholesale markets in the Southern and Eastern United States. Our California refineries have not processed crude oil since 2012 due to the high cost of crude oil relative to product yield and low asphalt demand. 
  We sell motor fuels under the Alon brand through various terminals to supply   639   Alon branded retail sites, including our retail segment convenience stores. In addition, we sell motor fuels through our wholesale distribution network on an unbranded basis.

  (unaudited, dollars in thousands except as noted)  

We are the majority owner of a renewable fuels project in California that began commercial production in February 2016 and converts tallow and vegetable oils into renewable fuels. The produced renewable fuels are drop-in replacements for petroleum-based fuels. The renewable fuels project generates both state and federal environmental credits as well as the federal blender s tax credit. 
  (b)  Asphalt Segment 
  We own or operate   11   asphalt terminals located in Texas (Big Spring), California (Paramount, Long Beach, Elk Grove, Bakersfield and Mojave), Washington (Richmond Beach), Arizona (Phoenix and Flagstaff), as well as asphalt terminals in which we own a   50%   interest located in Fernley, Nevada, and Brownwood, Texas. The operations in which we have a 50% interest are recorded under the equity method of accounting and the investments are included as part of total assets in the asphalt segment data. Asphalt produced by our Big Spring refinery is transferred to the asphalt segment at prices substantially determined by reference to the cost of crude oil, which is intended to approximate wholesale market prices. 
  (c)  Retail Segment 
  Our retail segment operates   307   convenience stores located in Central and West Texas and New Mexico. These convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the Alon brand name and food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7-Eleven brand name. Substantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery. 
  (d)  Corporate 
  Operations that are not included in any of the three segments are included in the corporate category. These operations consist primarily of corporate headquarters operating and depreciation expenses. 
  Segment data for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below:

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (unaudited, dollars in thousands except as noted)  

Total assets by reportable segment consisted of the following: 

Operating income (loss) for each segment consists of net sales less cost of sales, direct operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and gain (loss) on disposition of assets. Intersegment sales are intended to approximate wholesale market prices. Consolidated totals presented are after intersegment eliminations. 
  Total assets of each segment consist of net property, plant and equipment, inventories, cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables and other assets directly associated with the segment s operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of corporate headquarters information technology and administrative equipment. 
   
           (5) 
    Fair Value    
     We determine fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We classify financial assets and financial liabilities into the following fair value hierarchy: 
             
    Level 1 -     valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
                
    Level 2 -     valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and 
                
    Level 3 -     valued based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
     As required, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (levels 1 and 2) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (level 3) within the fair value hierarchy. We generally apply the  market approach  to determine fair value. This method uses pricing and other information generated by market transactions for identical or comparable assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level (least observable) input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. 
  The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The reported amounts of long-term debt approximate fair value. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value, which are based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are our only assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

The following table sets forth the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by input level, in the consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(6) 
    Derivative Financial Instruments    
     We selectively utilize crude oil and refined product commodity derivative contracts to reduce the risk associated with potential price changes on committed obligations as well as to reduce earnings volatility. We also utilize interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. We do not speculate using derivative instruments. Credit risk on our derivative instruments is mitigated by transacting with counterparties meeting established collateral and credit criteria. 
  Mark to Market 
  We have certain contracts that serve as economic hedges, which are derivatives used for risk management but not designated as hedges for financial accounting purposes. All economic hedge transactions are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recognized in earnings. 
  We have contracts that are used to fix prices on forecasted purchases of inventory, which we refer to as futures and forwards. Futures represent trades executed on the New York Mercantile Exchange which have not been closed or settled at the end of the reporting period. Forwards represent physical trades for which pricing and quantities have been set, but the physical product delivery has not occurred by the end of the reporting period.  
  We also have economic hedges in the form of swap contracts that fix price differentials between different types of crude oil and refined products that we use or produce at our refineries. At   September 30, 2016  , these swap contracts had aggregate volumes of   2,250 thousand   barrels of crude oil with contract terms through December 2016. 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  Fair value hedges are used to hedge price volatility of certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in earnings in the same period. 
  We have certain commodity contracts associated with the Supply and Offtake Agreements discussed in   Note 8   that have been accounted for as fair value hedges, which had purchase volumes of   466 thousand   barrels of crude oil as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  To designate a derivative as a cash flow hedge, we document at the inception of the hedge the assessment that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the hedged item. This assessment, which is updated at least quarterly, is generally based on the most recent relevant historical correlation between the derivative and the hedged item. If, during the term of the derivative, the hedge is determined to be no longer highly effective, hedge accounting is

  (unaudited, dollars in thousands except as noted)  

prospectively discontinued and any remaining unrealized gains or losses, based on the effective portion of the derivative at that date, are reclassified to earnings when the underlying transactions occur. 
  Commodity Derivatives.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any commodity swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges. During the first quarter of 2015, we elected to de-designate certain commodity swap contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges. Consequently, hedge accounting was discontinued for these commodity swap contracts and the related unrealized gains in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) were recorded into earnings as the underlying transactions occurred. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we reclassified gains of   $11,323   and   $29,260  , respectively, from OCI into cost of sales related to these de-designated cash flow hedges. 
  Related to commodity swap cash flow hedges in OCI, we recognized unrealized losses of   $0   and   $11,323   for the three months ended and   $0   and   $23,190   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives.    We have interest rate swap agreements, maturing March 2019, that effectively fix the variable LIBOR interest component of the term loans within the retail credit agreement. These interest rate swaps have been accounted for as cash flow hedges. The aggregate notional amount under these agreements covers approximately   75%   of the outstanding principal of these term loans throughout the duration of the interest rate swaps. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal of these term loans was   $99,917  . The interest rate swaps lock in an average fixed interest rate of   1.69%   through the remainder of 2016;   2.22%   in 2017;   2.89%   in 2018 and   3.06%   in 2019. 
  Related to interest rate swap cash flow hedges in OCI, we recognized unrealized gains (losses) of   $554   and   $(890)   for the three months ended and   $(669)   and   $(1,619)   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there was   no   cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income.   No   component of our cash flow hedges  gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have unrealized losses of   $2,845   classified in OCI related to cash flow hedges. Assuming interest rates remain unchanged, unrealized losses of   $1,001   will be reclassified from OCI into earnings over the next twelve-month period as the underlying transactions occur.

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
  Our derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements to manage counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives, and we offset the fair value amounts recorded for derivative instruments to the extent possible under these agreements on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  The following table presents offsetting information regarding our derivatives by type of transaction as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Compliance Program Market Risk 
  We are obligated by government regulations to blend a certain percentage of biofuels into the products that we produce and are consumed in the U.S. We purchase biofuels from third parties and blend those biofuels into our products, and each gallon of biofuel purchased includes a renewable identification number, or RIN. To the degree we are unable to blend biofuels at the required percentage, a RINs deficit is generated and we must acquire that number of RINs by the annual reporting deadline in order to remain in compliance with applicable regulations. Alternatively, if we have a RINs surplus, some of those RINs could be sold. Any such sales would be subject to our normal credit evaluation process. 
  We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with these governmental and regulatory programs. We manage this risk by purchasing RINs when prices are deemed favorable utilizing fixed price purchase contracts. We may also sell the RINs with an agreement to repurchase in the future. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase and sale exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. 
  The cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs (exclusive of benefit generated from our California renewable fuels project operations) was   $12,863   and   $6,558   for the three months ended and   $33,210   and   $29,648   for the   nine

           (7) 
    Inventories 
     Carrying value of inventories consisted of the following: 

The market value of refined products, asphalt and blendstock inventories exceeded LIFO costs by   $2,104   at   September 30, 2016   and was lower than LIFO costs by   $836   at   December 31, 2015  . The market value of crude oil inventories exceeded LIFO costs, net of the fair value hedged items, by   $12,100   and   $18,521   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
           (8) 
    Inventory Financing Agreements    
     We have entered into Supply and Offtake Agreements and other associated agreements (together the  Supply and Offtake Agreements ) with J. Aron   Company ( J. Aron ), to support the operations of our Big Spring, Krotz Springs and California refineries and certain of our asphalt terminals. Pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, (i) J. Aron agreed to sell to us, and we agreed to buy from J. Aron, at market prices, crude oil for processing at the refineries and (ii) we agreed to sell, and J. Aron agreed to buy, at market prices, certain refined products produced at the refineries. 
  The Supply and Offtake Agreements also provided for the sale, at market prices, of our crude oil and certain refined product inventories to J. Aron, the lease to J. Aron of crude oil and refined product storage facilities, and to identify prospective purchasers of refined products on J. Aron s behalf.  
  The Supply and Offtake Agreements for the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries have initial terms that expire in May 2021, and the Supply and Offtake Agreement for the California refineries has initial terms that expire in May 2019. J. Aron may elect to terminate the Supply and Offtake Agreements for the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries prior to the expiration of the initial term beginning in May 2018 and upon each anniversary thereof, on six months prior notice. We may elect to terminate at the Big Spring and Krotz refineries in May 2020 on six months prior notice. J. Aron may elect to terminate the Supply and Offtake Agreement for the California refineries prior to the expiration of the initial term in May 2017 and upon each anniversary thereof, on six months prior notice. We may elect to terminate at the California refineries in May 2018 on six months prior notice. 
  Following expiration or termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we are obligated to purchase the crude oil and refined product inventories then owned by J. Aron and located at the leased storage facilities at then current market prices. 
  Associated with the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we have designated fair value hedges of our inventory purchase commitments with J. Aron and crude oil inventory consigned to J. Aron ( crude oil consignment inventory ). Additionally, financing charges related to the Supply and Offtake Agreements are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  In connection with the Supply and Offtake Agreement for our Krotz Springs refinery, we have granted a security interest to J. Aron in all of its accounts and inventory to secure its obligations to J. Aron. In addition, we have granted a security interest in all of its real property and equipment to J. Aron to secure its obligations under a commodity hedge and sale agreement in lieu of posting cash collateral and being subject to cash margin calls. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had net current payables of   $34,703   and net current receivables of   $8,385  , respectively, with J. Aron for purchases and sales, and a consignment inventory receivable representing a deposit paid to J. Aron of   $26,179   and   $26,179  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had non-current liabilities for the original financing of   $21,142   and   $23,771  , respectively, net of the related fair value hedges.

Debt consisted of the following: 

(a)  Letter of Credit Facility and Alon USA, LP Revolving Credit Facility 
  We had letters of credit outstanding under our   $60,000   letter of credit facility of   $51,927   and   $60,627   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  We had borrowings of   $55,000   and   $55,000   and letters of credit of   $91,225   and   $48,590   outstanding under the Alon USA, LP   $240,000   revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  (b)  Convertible Senior Notes 
  The conversion rate for our   3.00%   unsecured convertible senior notes ( Convertible Notes ) is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including cash dividend adjustments, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion rate was adjusted to   72.504   shares of our common stock per each $1 (in thousands) principal amount of Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $13.79   per share, to reflect cash dividend adjustments. The strike price of the options was adjusted to   $13.79   per share and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to   $18.74   per share. Upon a potential change of control, we may have to settle the value of the warrants. Any future quarterly cash dividend payments in excess of   $0.06   per share will cause further adjustment based on the formula contained in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no conversions of the Convertible Notes. 
  In May 2015, Delek US Holdings, Inc. ( Delek ) acquired approximately   48%   of our outstanding common stock from Alon Israel Oil Company, Ltd. If Delek were to acquire greater than   50.00%   of our outstanding common stock, it could require us to settle the full principal amount of the Convertible Notes of   $150,000   and to render a make-whole payment to holders of our Convertible Notes, assuming full conversion. In the event of a conversion, the convertible note options will cover our obligation to render payment under the make-whole provision. Under these circumstances, we could also be required to settle the outstanding warrants, which had a value of approximately   $7,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on our share price as of   September 30, 2016  , we would not have to render a make-whole payment as our share price was below the minimum share price per the make-whole provision in the indenture. 
  (c)  Financial Covenants 
  We have certain credit agreements that contain maintenance financial covenants. At   September 30, 2016  ,   we were in compliance with these covenants  . 
   
           (13) 
    Stock-Based Compensation (share values in dollars) 
     Our overall executive incentive compensation program permits the granting of awards to our directors, officers and key employees in the form of options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares of common stock, restricted common stock units, performance shares, performance units and senior executive plan bonuses. 
  Restricted Stock  . Non-employee directors are awarded an annual grant of $25 in shares of restricted stock, which vest over a period of   three years  , assuming continued service at vesting. In May 2016, Alon granted awards of   14,000   restricted shares at a grant date price of   $8.93   per share. 
  In May 2015, we granted an award of   100,000   restricted shares to our CEO and President at a grant date price of   $18.82  . In May 2016, we granted awards of   158,333   restricted shares to our CEO and President at a grant date price of   $7.55   per share. The 2015 award and   100,000   shares of the 2016 award vested in May 2016 while the remaining   58,333   are scheduled to vest in December 2016. In July 2016, it was determined that awards made in 2015 and 2016 exceeded plan limits, and as a result it is

expected that an aggregate of   150,000   previously vested shares will be surrendered back to us by our CEO and President and the outstanding award of   58,333   restricted shares will be reduced to   50,000  . 
  In July 2016, we granted awards of   131,985   restricted shares to certain executive officers at a grant date price of   $6.66   per share. These July 2016 restricted shares will fully vest in December 2016, assuming continued service at vesting.  
  In August 2016, we granted awards of   69,980   restricted shares to certain executive officers at a grant date price of   $7.55   per share. These August 2016 restricted shares will vest as follows:   50%   in August 2017 and   50%   in August 2019, assuming continued service at vesting. 
  The following table summarizes the restricted share activity from January 1,   2016  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    These amounts do not reflect the surrendering of shares described above. 
     Compensation expense for restricted stock awards amounted to   $761   and   $2,920   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5,027   and   $5,234   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are   included in   selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of shares vested in 2016 was   $7,913  . 
  Restricted Stock Units.    Compensation expense for restricted stock units granted to our CEO and President amounted to   $0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $0   and   $249   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are   included in   selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Partnership Restricted Units.    Non-employee directors of the Partnership, who are designated by Alon s directors, are awarded an annual grant of $25 in restricted common units, which vest over a period of   three years  , assuming continued service at vesting. In May 2016, we granted awards of   7,653   restricted common units at a grant date price of   $9.80   per unit. In June 2016, we granted awards of   2,528   restricted common units at a grant date price of   $9.89   per unit. Compensation expense for the Partnership s restricted common unit grants amounted to   $25   and   $20   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $53   and   $40   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are   included in   selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Unrecognized Compensation Cost  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $2,015   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.1   years.

    Equity (share values in dollars) 
     Changes to equity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are presented below: 

(a)  Common Stock 
  Amended Shareholde  r Agreement.      In 2012, we signed agreements with the remaining non-controlling interest shareholders of Alon Assets, Inc. ( Alon Assets ) whereby the participants would exchange shares of Alon Assets for shares of our common stock.     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,     349,042     shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for     1,865.94     shares of Alon Assets. At     September 30, 2016  ,     349,042     shares of our common stock are available to be exchanged for all of the outstanding shares held by the non-controlling interest shareholder of Alon Assets. 
  We recognized compensation     expense associated with the difference in value between the participants' ownership of Alon Assets compared to our common stock of     $189     and     $573     for the three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and     $896     and     $1,756     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
           (b) 
    Dividends 
     Common Stock Dividends.    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid the following dividends: 

(c) 
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
     The following table displays the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax: 

(15) 
    Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
     Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the average number of participating shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of granted stock appreciation rights, granted restricted common stock units, granted restricted common stock awards, convertible debt and warrants using the treasury stock method.

The calculation of earnings (loss) per share, basic and diluted, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , is as follows (shares in thousands, per share value in dollars): 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we excluded   112   and   132   common stock equivalents, respectively, from the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as the effect of including such shares would be anti-dilutive. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the weighted average diluted shares includes all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. 
   
           (16) 
    Related Party Transactions    
     Delek US Holdings, Inc. 
  In May 2015, Delek completed the purchase of approximately   48%   of our outstanding common stock from Alon Israel Oil Company, Ltd. We have transactions with Delek that occur in the ordinary course of business. Including amounts prior to the transaction, we purchased refined products from Delek of   $705   and   $7,328   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $2,242   and   $9,728   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
   
           (17) 
    Commitments and Contingencies    
              (a) 
    Commitments 
     In the normal course of business, we have long-term commitments to purchase, at market prices, utilities such as natural gas, electricity and water for use by our refineries, terminals, pipelines and retail locations. We are also party to various refined product and crude oil supply and exchange agreements, which are typically short-term in nature or provide terms for cancellation. 
           (b) 
    Contingencies 
     We are involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  One of our subsidiaries is a party to a lawsuit alleging breach of contract pertaining to an asphalt supply agreement. We believe that we have valid counterclaims as well as affirmative defenses that will preclude recovery. Attempts to reach a commercial arrangement to resolve the dispute have been unsuccessful to this point. This matter is currently not scheduled for trial. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of this lawsuit. 
           (c) 
    Environmental 
     We are subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to incur future obligations to investigate the effects of the release or disposal of certain petroleum, chemical, and mineral substances at various sites; to remediate or restore these sites and to compensate others for damage to property and natural resources. These contingent obligations relate to sites that we own and are associated with past or present operations. We are currently participating in environmental investigations, assessments and cleanups pertaining to our refineries, service stations, pipelines and terminals. We may be involved in additional future environmental investigations, assessments and cleanups. The magnitude of future costs are unknown and will depend on factors such as the nature and contamination at many sites, the timing, extent and

  Company Overview 
  We are an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the South Central, Southwestern and Western regions of the United States. We own 100% of the general partner and 81.6% of the limited partner interests in the Partnership (NYSE: ALDW), which owns a crude oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas, with a crude oil throughput capacity of 73,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) and an integrated wholesale marketing business. In addition, we directly own a crude oil refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana, with a crude oil throughput capacity of 74,000 bpd. We also own crude oil refineries in California, which have not processed crude oil since 2012. We own a majority interest in a renewable fuels project in California, with a throughput capacity of 2,500 bpd. We are a leading marketer of asphalt, which we distribute primarily through asphalt terminals located predominately in the Southwestern and Western United States. We are the largest 7-Eleven licensee in the United States and operate approximately 300 convenience stores which also market motor fuels in Central and West Texas and New Mexico. 
  Refining and Marketing 
  Our refining and marketing segment includes a sour crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas, a light sweet crude oil refinery located in Krotz Springs, Louisiana, and heavy crude oil refineries located in Paramount, Bakersfield and Long Beach, California ( California refineries ). Our California refineries have not processed crude oil since 2012 due to the high costs of crude oil relative to product yield and low asphalt demand. We refine crude oil into petroleum products, including various grades of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, petrochemical feedstocks, asphalt and other petroleum-based products, which are marketed primarily in the South Central, Southwestern and Western regions of the United States. 
  We own the Big Spring refinery and its integrated wholesale marketing operations through the Partnership. Our marketing of transportation fuels produced at the Big Spring refinery is focused on Central and West Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona. We refer to our operations in these regions as our  physically integrated system  because our distributors in this region are supplied primarily with motor fuels produced at our Big Spring refinery and distributed through a network of pipelines and terminals that we own or access through leases or long-term throughput agreements. 
  We sell motor fuels under the Alon brand through various terminals to supply   639   locations, including our retail segment convenience stores. We provide substantially all of our branded customers motor fuels, brand support and payment processing services in addition to the license of the Alon brand name and associated trade dress. 
  We market transportation fuel production from our Krotz Springs refinery substantially through bulk sales and exchange channels. These bulk sales and exchange arrangements are entered into with various oil companies and trading companies and are transported to markets on the Mississippi River and the Atchafalaya River as well as to the Colonial Pipeline. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began shipping and selling gasoline into wholesale markets in the Southern and Eastern United States using our status as a regular shipper on the Colonial Pipeline. 
  We are the majority owner of a renewable fuels project in California that began commercial production in February 2016 and converts tallow and vegetable oils into renewable fuels. The produced renewable fuels are drop-in replacements for petroleum-based fuels. The renewable fuels project generates both state and federal environmental credits as well as the federal blender s tax credit. The throughput and production data for our California renewable fuels project are generally not included in our combined refinery data, unless otherwise specified.

Asphalt 
  We own or operate 11 asphalt terminals located in Texas (Big Spring), Washington (Richmond Beach), California (Paramount, Long Beach, Elk Grove, Bakersfield and Mojave), Arizona (Phoenix and Flagstaff) as well as asphalt terminals in which we own a 50% interest located in Fernley, Nevada, and Brownwood, Texas. The operations in which we have a 50% interest are recorded under the equity method of accounting and the investments are included as part of total assets in the asphalt segment data. 
  We purchase non-blended asphalt from third parties in addition to non-blended asphalt produced at the Big Spring refinery. We market asphalt through our terminals as blended and non-blended asphalt. We have an exclusive license to use advanced asphalt-blending technology in West Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, and a non-exclusive license in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, with respect to asphalt produced at our Big Spring refinery. 
  Asphalt produced by our Big Spring refinery is transferred to the asphalt segment at prices substantially determined by reference to the cost of crude oil, which is intended to approximate wholesale market prices. We market asphalt primarily as paving asphalt to road and materials manufacturers and as ground tire rubber polymer modified or emulsion asphalt to highway construction/maintenance contractors. Sales of asphalt are seasonal with the majority of sales occurring between May and October. 
  Retail 
  Our convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline, diesel, food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7 Eleven and Alon brand names. Substantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery. 
  For additional information on each of our operating segments, see Items 1. and 2.  Business and Properties  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Third   Quarter Operational and Financial Highlights 
  Operating loss for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $3.4 million  , compared to operating income of   $86.9 million   for the same period last year. Our operational and financial highlights for the   third   quarter of   2016   include the following: 
              
    Refinery operating margin at the Big Spring refinery was   $9.22   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $16.71   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . This decrease in operating margin was primarily due to a lower Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread and increased RINs costs, partially offset by a widening of both the WTI Cushing to WTI Midland and WTI Cushing to WTS spreads and an increased benefit from the contango market environment which reduced the cost of crude. 
                
    Refinery operating margin at the Krotz Springs refinery was   $3.42   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $6.66   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . This decrease in operating margin was primarily due to a lower Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread, a narrowing of the LLS to WTI Cushing spread and increased RINs costs, partially offset by a widening of the WTI Cushing to WTI Midland spread and an increased benefit from the contango market environment which reduced the cost of crude.

compared to   $3.78   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . The average Brent to LLS spread for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $(1.92)   per barrel compared to   $(0.26)   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . 
             
    The average RINs cost effect on the Big Spring refinery operating margin was   $0.58   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $0.27   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . The average RINs cost effect on the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin was   $1.47   per barrel for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $0.74   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . 
                
    The contango environment in the   third   quarter of   2016   created an average cost of crude benefit of   $0.84   per barrel compared to an average cost of crude benefit of   $0.57   per barrel for the same period in   2015  . 
                
    On March 1, 2016, we began consolidating our renewable fuels project as part of our refining and marketing segment in our consolidated financial statements. For the   third   quarter of   2016  , our statements of operations include revenues of   $48.5 million   and operating income of   $6.1 million   related to the project s operations. 
        
  Major Influences on Results of Operations 
  Refining and Marketing  .  Earnings and cash flows from our refining and marketing segment are primarily affected by the difference between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. These prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. While our sales and operating revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in crude oil and refined product prices, it is the spread between crude oil and refined product prices, not necessarily fluctuations in those prices, that affects our earnings. 
  In order to measure our operating performance, we compare our per barrel refinery operating margins to certain industry benchmarks. We calculate this margin for each refinery by dividing the refinery s gross margin by its throughput volumes. Gross margin is the difference between net sales and cost of sales (exclusive of certain adjustments and inclusive of RINs costs). Each refinery is compared to an industry benchmark that is intended to approximate that refinery s crude slate and product yield. 
  We compare our Big Spring refinery s operating margin to the Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread. A Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread is calculated assuming that three barrels of WTI Cushing crude oil are converted, or cracked, into two barrels of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one barrel of Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel. 
  We compare our Krotz Springs refinery s operating margin to the Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread. A Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread is calculated assuming that two barrels of LLS crude oil are converted into one barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one barrel of Gulf Coast high sulfur diesel. 
  Our Big Spring refinery is capable of processing substantial volumes of sour crude oil, which has historically cost less than intermediate and sweet crude oils. We measure the cost advantage of refining sour crude oil by calculating the difference between the price of WTI Cushing crude oil and the price of WTS, a medium, sour crude oil. We refer to this differential as the WTI Cushing/WTS, or sweet/sour, spread. A widening of the sweet/sour spread can favorably influence the operating margin for our Big Spring refinery. The Big Spring refinery s crude oil input is primarily comprised of WTS and WTI Midland. 
  The Krotz Springs refinery has the capability to process substantial volumes of low-sulfur, or sweet, crude oils to produce a high percentage of light, high-value refined products. Sweet crude oil typically comprises 100% of the Krotz Springs refinery s crude oil input. The Krotz Springs refinery s crude oil input is primarily comprised of LLS and WTI Midland. 
  In addition, the location of the Big Spring refinery near Midland, the largest origination terminal for West Texas crude oil, provides reliable crude sourcing with a relatively low transportation cost. We are also able to source locally produced crude at Big Spring by truck, which tends to have cost and quality advantages. The WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of WTI Cushing crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Midland crude oil. A widening of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread will favorably influence the operating margin for both our  
  
    26 

     Table of Contents  

Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries. Alternatively, a narrowing of this differential will have an adverse effect on our operating margins. 
  Recently, the additional takeaway capacity moving crude from Midland to the Gulf Coast has caused a contraction of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread. In addition, the relative small growth in WTS production compared to WTI production and the relative high demand for WTS has caused a contraction of the WTI Cushing less WTS spread. 
  Global product prices are influenced by the price of Brent crude which is a global benchmark crude. Global product prices influence product prices in the U.S. As a result, both our Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries are influenced by the spread between Brent crude and WTI Cushing. The Brent less WTI Cushing spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Cushing crude oil. A widening of the spread between Brent and WTI Cushing will favorably influence both the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries  operating margins. Also, the Krotz Springs refinery is influenced by the spread between Brent crude and LLS. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of LLS crude oil. A discount in LLS relative to Brent will favorably influence the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin. 
  The results of operations from our refining and marketing segment are also significantly affected by our refineries  operating costs, particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile. Typically, electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices. 
  Demand for gasoline products is generally higher during summer months than during winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic. As a result, the operating results for our refining and marketing segment for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters. The effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by seasonality in demand for diesel, which in our region is generally higher in winter months as east-west trucking traffic moves south to avoid winter conditions on northern routes. 
  Safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our refineries are critical to our financial performance. The financial impact of planned downtime, such as a turnaround or major maintenance project, is mitigated through a diligent planning process that considers expectations for product availability, margin environment and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance. 
  The nature of our business requires us to maintain crude oil and refined product inventories. Crude oil and refined products are essentially commodities, and we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Because our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) inventory valuation methodology, price fluctuations generally have little effect on our financial results. 
  Asphalt  .  Earnings and cash flows from our asphalt segment depend primarily upon the margin between the price at which we sell our asphalt and the price asphalt is purchased from third parties or the transfer price for asphalt produced at the Big Spring refinery. Asphalt is transferred to our asphalt segment from our refining and marketing segment at prices substantially determined by reference to the cost of crude oil, which is intended to approximate wholesale market prices. A portion of our asphalt sales are made using fixed price contracts for delivery at future dates. Because these contracts are priced using market prices for asphalt at the time of the contract, a change in the cost of crude oil between the time we enter into the contract and the time we produce the asphalt can positively or negatively influence the earnings of our asphalt segment. Demand for paving asphalt products is higher during warmer months than during colder months due to seasonal increases in road construction work. As a result, revenues from our asphalt segment for the first and fourth calendar quarters are expected to be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters. 
  Retail  .  Earnings and cash flows from our retail segment are primarily affected by merchandise and retail fuel sales volumes and margins at our convenience stores. Retail merchandise gross margin is equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the retail merchandise, net of vendor discounts and rebates, measured as a percentage of total retail merchandise sales. Retail merchandise sales are driven by convenience, branding and competitive pricing. Retail fuel margin is equal to retail fuel sales less the delivered cost of fuel and excise taxes, measured on a cents per gallon ( cpg ) basis. Our retail fuel margins are driven by local supply, demand and competitor pricing. Our retail sales are seasonal and peak in the second and third quarters of the year, while the first and fourth quarters usually experience lower overall sales.

Factors Affecting Comparability 
  Our financial condition and operating results over the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been influenced by the following factors which are fundamental to understanding comparisons of our period-to-period financial performance. 
  Maintenance and Reduced Crude Oil Throughput 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , throughput at the Big Spring refinery was reduced as a result of a reformer regeneration during the first quarter of 2016, which was repeated during the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, throughput was reduced as a result of a catalyst replacement for our diesel hydrotreater unit in the first quarter of 2016 and unplanned downtime during the second quarter of 2016 due to a power outage caused by inclement weather, which affected multiple units. 
  The reduced throughput at the Krotz Springs refinery during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of our election to reduce the crude rate in order to optimize the refinery yield, as well as maintenance that was performed on the fluid catalytic cracking unit during the second quarter of 2016. 
  On March 1, 2016, we began consolidating our renewable fuels project as part of our refining and marketing segment in our consolidated financial statements. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , our statements of operations include operating income of   $6.1 million   and   $13.0 million  , respectively, related to the project s operations. 
  Certain Derivative Impacts 
  Included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commodity swaps of   $(0.1) million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, compared to   $12.1 million   and   $49.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Results of Operations 
  The period-to-period comparison of our results of operations has been prepared using the historical periods included in our consolidated financial statements. We refer to our financial statement line items in the explanation of our period-to-period changes in results of operations. Below are general definitions of what those line items include and represent. 
  Net Sales  . Net sales consist primarily of sales of refined petroleum products through our refining and marketing segment and asphalt segment and sales of merchandise, food products and motor fuels through our retail segment. 
  Refining and marketing net sales consist of gross sales, net of customer rebates, discounts and excise taxes and include intersegment sales to our asphalt and retail segments, which are eliminated through consolidation of our financial statements. Also included in net sales are environmental credits in the form of RINs, low-carbon fuel standards credits and blender s tax credits generated at our California renewable fuels project. Asphalt net sales consist of gross sales, net of any discounts and applicable taxes. Our petroleum and asphalt product sales are mainly affected by crude oil and refined product prices and volume changes caused by operations. Retail net sales consist of gross merchandise sales, less rebates, commissions and discounts, and gross fuel sales, including excise taxes. Our retail merchandise sales are affected primarily by competition and seasonal influences. 
  Cost of Sales  . Refining and marketing cost of sales includes principally crude oil, blending materials and RINs, other raw materials and transportation costs, which include costs associated with crude oil and product pipelines which we utilize. Asphalt cost of sales includes costs of purchased asphalt, blending materials and transportation costs. Retail cost of sales includes motor fuels and merchandise. Retail fuel cost of sales represents the cost of purchased fuel, including transportation costs and associated excise taxes. Merchandise cost of sales includes the delivered cost of merchandise purchases, net of merchandise rebates and commissions. Cost of sales excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Direct Operating Expenses  . Direct operating expenses, which relate to our refining and marketing and asphalt segments, include costs associated with the actual operations of our refineries and asphalt terminals, such as energy and utility costs, routine maintenance, labor, insurance and environmental compliance costs. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  . Selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses consist primarily of costs relating to the operations of our convenience stores, including labor, utilities, maintenance and retail corporate overhead costs. Corporate overhead and wholesale marketing expenses are also included in SG A expenses for the refining and marketing and asphalt segments. 
  Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization represents an allocation of the cost of capital assets to expense within the consolidated statements of operations. The cost is expensed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Depreciation and amortization also includes deferred turnaround and catalyst replacement costs. Turnaround and catalyst replacement costs are currently deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis beginning the month after the completion of the turnaround and ending immediately prior to the next scheduled turnaround. 
  Operating income  . Operating income represents our net sales less our total operating costs and expenses. 
  Interest expense  . Interest expense includes interest expense, letters of credit, financing charges related to the supply and offtake agreements, financing fees, and amortization of both original issuance discount and deferred debt issuance costs but excludes capitalized interest.

    Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before net income attributable to non-controlling interest, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization and (gain) loss on disposition of assets. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP; however, the amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. Our management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of net income attributable to non-controlling interest, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, (gain) loss on disposition of assets and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 
     Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
             
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the prior claim that non-controlling interest have on the income generated by non-wholly-owned subsidiaries; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs; and 
                
    Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from EBITDA calculations of other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
     Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.

    Net sales include intersegment sales to our asphalt and retail segments at prices which approximate wholesale market prices. These intersegment sales are eliminated through consolidation of our financial statements. 
              (2) 
    Refinery operating margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the margin between net sales and cost of sales (exclusive of certain adjustments) attributable to each refinery by the refinery s throughput volumes. Industry-wide refining results are driven and measured by the margins between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil, which are referred to as crack spreads. We compare our refinery operating margins to these crack spreads to assess our operating performance relative to other participants in our industry. 
     The refinery operating margin for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   excludes realized and unrealized gains (losses) on commodity swaps of   $(66)   and   $395  , respectively. 
  The refinery operating margin for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   excludes realized and unrealized gains on commodity swaps of   $12,101   and   $49,456  , respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , $8,569 related substantially to inventory adjustments was not included in cost of sales for either the Big Spring refinery or the Krotz Springs refinery. 
           (3) 
    The California renewable fuels project operating margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the project s margin between net sales and cost of sales by the project s throughput volumes. Included in net sales are environmental credits in the form of RINs, low-carbon fuel standards credits and blender s tax credits generated by the project. 
              (4) 
    Refinery direct operating expense is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing direct operating expenses at our refineries by the applicable refinery s total throughput volumes. 
              (5) 
    Total refinery throughput represents the total barrels per day of crude oil and blendstock inputs in the refinery production process. Total throughput for the California renewable fuels project represents the total barrels per day of tallow and vegetable oils used by the project. 
              (6) 
    Total refinery production represents the barrels per day of various products produced from processing crude and other refinery feedstocks through the crude units and other conversion units at the refineries. Total production for the California renewable fuels project represents the total barrels per day produced from processing tallow and vegetable oils through the project s units. 
              (7)

Operating income for our asphalt segment was   $9.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $18.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $8.8 million  . This decrease was primarily due to reduced gains related to asphalt inventory price adjustments and lower asphalt margins. Operating income was impacted by gains of   $1.7 million   and   $7.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, resulting from a price adjustment related to asphalt inventory. Asphalt margins for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $93.57   per ton compared to   $120.39   per ton for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Retail Segment.    Operating income for our retail marketing segment was   $5.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $2.2 million  , or   29.7%  . This decrease was primarily due to increased SG A expenses and reduced merchandise sales. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $16.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $20.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $4.7 million  , or   22.7%  . This decrease was primarily due to the effect of crude oil prices moving further into contango on our supply and offtake agreements. 
  Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
  Income tax benefit was   $5.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $17.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a change of   $22.9 million  . Income tax expense decreased as a result of having a pre-tax loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to having pre-tax income for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate was   43.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to an effective tax rate of   24.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The higher effective tax rate is primarily due to not having the benefit received from domestic production activity deduction associated with taxable income as well as the impact of the non-controlling interest s share of Partnership taxable income. These two elements are the primary reason for the effective tax rate being below the statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 
  Net income attributable to non-controlling interest primarily consists of the proportional share of the Partnership s income attributable to the limited partner interests held by the public. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was   $1.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $8.9 million  . 
  Net Income (Loss) Available to Stockholders 
  Net loss available to stockholders was   $8.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $41.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $50.7 million  . This decrease was attributable to the factors discussed above.

The average per gallon price of Gulf Coast high sulfur diesel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $0.42  , or   27.3%  , to   $1.12  , compared to   $1.54   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Combined refinery average throughput for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   136,730   bpd compared to a combined refinery average throughput of   147,800   bpd for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   7.5%  . The reduced throughput at our Big Spring refinery during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of a reformer regeneration during the first quarter of 2016, which was repeated during the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, throughput was reduced as a result of a catalyst replacement for our diesel hydrotreater unit in the first quarter of 2016 and unplanned downtime during the second quarter of 2016 due to a power outage caused by inclement weather, which affected multiple units. The reduced throughput at the Krotz Springs refinery during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of our election to reduce the crude rate to improve the refinery yield structure, as well as maintenance that was performed on the fluid catalytic cracking unit during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Asphalt Segment.    Net sales for our asphalt segment were   $195.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $209.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $13.6 million  , or   6.5%  . This decrease was primarily due to lower blended asphalt sales prices. 
  Retail Segment.    Net sales for our retail segment were   $543.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $591.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $47.8 million  , or   8.1%  . This decrease was primarily due to lower retail fuel sales prices, partially offset by increased volumes related to the 14 stores acquired in 2015. The retail fuel sales price decreased   17.9%   to   $1.92   per gallon for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $2.34   per gallon for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Retail fuel sales volume increased   5.4%   to   155.0 million   gallons for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   147.0 million   gallons for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

This decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil prices, lower refinery throughput and lower retail fuel costs, partially offset by higher asphalt sales volumes. 
  Refining and Marketing Segment.    Cost of sales for our refining and marketing segment were   $2,140.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2,506.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $365.8 million  , or   14.6%  . This decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil prices and lower refinery throughput, partially offset by the operations of our California renewable fuels project. The average price of WTI Cushing decreased   19.0%   to   $41.23   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $50.91   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Asphalt Segment  .  Cost of sales for our asphalt segment were   $150.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $174.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $24.0 million  , or   13.8%  .

Direct operating expenses for our refining and marketing segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $181.1 million  , compared to   $170.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $10.6 million  , or   6.2%  . This increase was primarily due to the operations of our California renewable fuels project and higher maintenance costs at our refineries, partially offset by lower utility costs. 
  Asphalt Segment.    Direct operating expenses for our asphalt segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $18.8 million  , compared to   $21.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $2.9 million  , or   13.4%  . This decrease was primarily due to lower fixed operating costs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of realignment of our asphalt operations during 2015. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Consolidated  .  SG A expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $147.1 million  , compared to   $148.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $1.8 million  , or   1.2%  . 
  Refining and Marketing Segment  .  SG A expenses for our refining and marketing segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $53.1 million  , compared to   $59.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $6.4 million  , or   10.8%  . This decrease was primarily due to reduced employee related costs, partially offset by higher professional fees. 
  Asphalt Segment  .  SG A expenses for our asphalt segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $8.5 million  , compared to   $7.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $1.3 million  , or   18.1%  . This increase was primarily due to higher corporate expense allocated to the asphalt segment. 
  Retail Segment  .  SG A expenses for our retail segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $85.0 million  , compared to   $81.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $3.3 million  , or   4.0%  . This increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs including the increase in costs due to the addition of 14 stores in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $108.7 million  , compared to   $94.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $14.4 million  , or   15.3%  . This increase was primarily due to increased amortization of turnaround and catalyst replacement costs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulting from the completion of the planned major turnaround at the Krotz Springs refinery during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Operating Income (Loss) 
  Consolidated  .  Operating loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $57.7 million  , compared to operating income of   $242.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $300.2 million  . This decrease was primarily due to lower refinery operating margins, decreased refinery throughput, lower retail fuel and merchandise margins and the impacts of commodity swaps, partially offset by higher asphalt margins and the operations of our California renewable fuels project. 
  Refining and Marketing Segment.    Operating loss for our refining and marketing segment was   $83.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to operating income of   $220.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $304.2 million  . This decrease was primarily due to lower refinery operating margins, decreased refinery throughput and the impacts of commodity swaps, partially offset by the operations of our California renewable fuels project. We had realized and unrealized gains on commodity swaps of   $0.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $49.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Refinery operating margin at the Big Spring refinery was   $8.52   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.95   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease in operating margin was primarily due to a lower Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread and a narrowing of the WTI Cushing to WTI Midland spread, partially offset by a widening of the WTI Cushing to WTS spread and an increased benefit from the contango market environment which reduced the cost of crude. The average Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread decreased to   $12.57   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $19.08   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average WTI Cushing to WTI Midland spread narrowed to   $0.12   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.60   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average WTI Cushing to WTS spread widened to   $0.53   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.02   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average Brent to WTI Cushing spread narrowed to   $0.35   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.28   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The contango environment for the   nine   months

     Table of Contents  

ended   September 30, 2016   created an average cost of crude benefit of   $1.39   per barrel compared to an average cost of crude benefit of   $1.04   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Refinery operating margin at the Krotz Springs refinery was   $2.94   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8.05   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease in operating margin was primarily due to a lower Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread, a narrowing of both the WTI Cushing to WTI Midland and the LLS to WTI Cushing spreads and increased RINs costs, partially offset by an increased benefit from the contango market environment which reduced the cost of crude. The average Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $7.73   per barrel, compared to   $12.05   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average LLS to WTI Cushing spread narrowed to   $1.79   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.27   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average Brent to LLS spread narrowed to   $(1.48)   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.30   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average RINs cost effect on refinery operating margin was   $1.45   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.06   per barrel for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Asphalt Segment.    Operating income for our asphalt segment was   $14.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $11.9 million  . This increase was primarily due to reduced losses related to asphalt inventory price adjustments, higher asphalt sales volumes and lower direct operating expenses, partially offset by lower asphalt margins. Operating income was impacted by losses of   $0.3 million   and   $6.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, resulting from a price adjustment related to asphalt inventory. Asphalt margins for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $96.25   per ton compared to   $106.60   per ton for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Retail Segment.    Operating income for our retail segment was   $14.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $21.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $7.0 million  , or   33.0%  . This decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise sales, lower merchandise margins and increased SG A expenses primarily related the addition of 14 stores during 2015. Merchandise margins were   31.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   32.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $53.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $60.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $6.9 million  , or   11.5%  . This decrease was primarily due to the effect of crude oil prices moving further into contango on our supply and offtake agreements. 
  Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
  Income tax benefit was   $35.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $53.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Income tax expense decreased as a result of having a pre-tax loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to having pre-tax income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our effective tax rate was   35.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to an effective tax rate of   28.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The lower effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was the result of having the benefit received from domestic production activity deduction associated with taxable income as well as the impact of the non-controlling interest s share of Partnership taxable income. These two factors are the primary reason for the effective tax rate being below the statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 
  Net income attributable to non-controlling interest primarily consists of the proportional share of the Partnership s income attributable to the limited partner interests held by the public. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was   $0.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $28.3 million  . 
  Net Income (Loss) Available to Stockholders 
  Net loss available to stockholders was   $64.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income available to stockholders of   $105.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $170.0 million  . This decrease was attributable to the factors discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, inventory supply and offtake arrangements and other sources of credit lines. 
  We have agreements with J. Aron for the supply of crude oil that support the operations of all our refineries as well as certain of our asphalt terminals. These agreements substantially reduce our physical inventories and our associated need to issue letters of credit to support crude oil and asphalt purchases. In addition, the structure allows us to acquire crude oil and asphalt without the constraints of a maximum facility size during periods of high crude oil prices. 
  We believe that the aforementioned sources of funds and other sources of capital available to us will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. 
  Depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or equity securities, or other possible capital markets transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness, extend or replace existing revolving credit facilities or for other corporate purposes. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $17.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $176.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in cash flows provided by operations of   $158.5 million   was primarily attributable to reduced net income (loss) after adjusting for non-cash items of   $185.8 million  , increased cash used for inventories of   $41.1 million  , increased cash used for other non-current liabilities of   $10.4 million  , increased cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets of   $8.7 million   and reduced cash collected on receivables of   $17.3 million  . These changes were partially offset by reduced cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities of   $77.5 million   and reduced cash used for other assets of   $27.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $85.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $78.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash flows used in investing activities of   $7.0 million   was primarily attributable to higher cash used for capital expenditures and capital expenditures for turnarounds and catalysts of   $10.6 million   and cash used to acquire a controlling interest in our California renewable fuels project of   $7.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $98.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $74.1 million   net cash used in financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities of   $172.3 million   was primarily attributable to lower repayments of   $10.0 million   on our revolving credit facilities, reduced payments to shareholders and non-controlling interests of   $21.6 million   and increased cash received on our inventory agreement transactions of   $153.4 million  , partially offset by reduced cash received from long-term debt agreements of   $14.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Indebtedness 
  Alon USA Energy, Inc. Letter of Credit Facility.    We have a credit facility for the issuance of standby letters of credit in an amount not to exceed   $60.0 million  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had letters of credit outstanding under this facility of   $51.9 million   and   $60.6 million  , respectively. 
  Alon USA, LP Revolving Credit Facility.    We have a   $240.0 million   revolving credit facility that can be used both for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. We had borrowings of   $55.0 million   and   $55.0 million   and letters of credit outstanding of   $91.2 million   and   $48.6 million   under this facility at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Convertible Senior Notes  .  The conversion rate for our 3.00% unsecured convertible senior notes ( Convertible Notes ) is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including cash dividend adjustments, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion rate was adjusted to   72.504   shares of our common stock per each $1 (in thousands) principal amount of Convertible Notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $13.79   per share, to reflect cash dividend adjustments. The strike price of the options was adjusted to   $13.79   per share and the strike price of the warrants was adjusted to   $18.74   per share. Upon a potential change of control, we may have to settle the value of the warrants. Any future quarterly cash dividend payments in excess of   $0.06   per share will cause further adjustment based on the formula contained in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no conversions of the Convertible Notes. 
  In May 2015, Delek acquired approximately   48%   of our outstanding common stock from Alon Israel Oil Company, Ltd. If Delek were to acquire greater than   50.00%   of our outstanding common stock, it could require us to settle the full principal amount of the Convertible Notes of   $150.0 million   and to render a make-whole payment to holders of our Convertible Notes, assuming full conversion. In the event of a conversion, the convertible note options will cover our obligation to render payment under the make-whole provision. Under these circumstances, we could also be required to settle the outstanding warrants, which had a value of approximately   $7.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on our share price as of   September 30, 2016  , we would not have to render a make-whole payment as our share price was below the minimum share price per the make-whole provision in the indenture. 
  Capital Spending 
  Each year our board of directors approves capital projects, including sustaining maintenance, regulatory and planned turnaround and catalyst projects that our management is authorized to undertake in our annual capital budget. Additionally, our management assesses opportunities for growth and profit improvement projects on an ongoing basis and any related projects require further approval from our board of directors. Our total capital expenditure projection for   2016   is   $66.0 million  , which includes expenditures for catalysts and turnarounds and approximately $10.0 million of special regulatory projects. Approximately   $79.3 million   has been spent during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which includes approximately $21.0 million of payments during 2016 for expenditures incurred during 2015. 
   
  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
  There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business from our contractual obligations and commercial commitments detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
  Changes in commodity prices, purchased fuel prices and interest rates are our primary sources of market risk. Our risk management committee oversees all activities associated with the identification, assessment and management of our market risk exposure. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations. Our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices, which depend on many factors, including demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, changes in the economy, worldwide production levels, worldwide inventory levels and governmental regulatory initiatives. Our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations. 
  In order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility, we have consistently applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level. In the past, circumstances have occurred, such as timing of crude oil cargo deliveries, turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level. Upon the review and approval of our risk management committee, we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances. 
  We maintain inventories of crude oil, refined products, asphalt and blendstocks, the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by world economic conditions, regional and global inventory levels and seasonal conditions. At   September 30, 2016  , the market value of refined products, asphalt and blendstock inventories exceeded LIFO costs by   $2.1 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , the market value of crude oil inventories exceeded LIFO costs, net of the fair value hedged items, by   $12.1 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held 0.6 million barrels of refined products, asphalt and blendstock and 1.1 million barrels of crude oil inventories valued under the LIFO valuation method. If the market value of refined products, asphalt and blendstock inventories would have been $1.00 per barrel lower, the market value of product inventories would have still exceeded LIFO costs by $1.5 million, requiring no inventory adjustment to be made. If the market value of crude oil would have been $1.00 per barrel lower, the market value of crude oil inventories would have still exceeded LIFO costs, net of the fair value hedged item, by $11.0 million, requiring no inventory adjustment to be made. 
  All commodity derivative contracts are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods is recorded in the profit and loss section or accumulated other comprehensive income of our consolidated financial statements.  Forwards  represent physical trades for which pricing and quantities have been set, but the physical product delivery has not occurred by the end of the reporting period.  Futures  represent trades which have been executed on the New York Mercantile Exchange which have not been closed or settled at the end of the reporting period. A  long  represents an obligation to purchase product and a  short  represents an obligation to sell product.

The following table provides information about our commodity derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $420.9 million  , excluding discounts and issuance costs, of our outstanding debt was subject to floating interest rates, of which   $240.6 million   was charged interest at the Eurodollar rate (with a floor of 1.25%) plus a margin of   8.00%  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had interest rate swap contracts, maturing March 2019, that effectively fix the variable interest component on approximately $75.9 million of the outstanding principal of the term loans within the retail credit agreement.  
  An increase of 1% in the variable rate on our indebtedness, after considering the instrument subject to a minimum interest rate and the interest rate swap contracts, would result in an increase to our interest expense of approximately   $1.7 million   per year.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms including, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as described in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. 
  There can be no assurance that the proposed acquisition of all our outstanding common stock by Delek will be agreed upon, approved and ultimately consummated, and the terms of any such transaction may differ materially from those originally proposed by Delek. 
  A committee of directors with no affiliation to Delek (the  Special Committee ) of members of the board of directors of Alon was established and has reviewed a number of strategic alternatives, including a potential business combination with Delek.  On October 14, 2016, Delek delivered a proposal to the Special Committee to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock not already owned by Delek in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.44 shares of Delek common stock for each outstanding share of our common stock.  The proposal is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and approval of such definitive agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder by the board of directors of Delek and the Special Committee, as well as our non-Delek stockholders. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated. 
  We cannot predict whether the terms of a potential transaction will be agreed upon by Delek and the Special Committee or whether any such transaction would be approved by our stockholders. We also cannot predict the timing, final structure and other terms of any potential transaction, and the terms of any such transaction may differ materially from those originally proposed by Delek.  In addition, any changes in the market prices of our common stock could affect whether the Delek, the Special Committee and our stockholders ultimately approve the proposed transaction, or if such approval is granted, the terms on which the proposed transaction is approved. 
  If a transaction is not agreed upon, approved and consummated for any reason, we may be subject to a number of other risks, including the following: 
             
    the current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that a transaction will occur and a failure to agree upon, approve and consummate a transaction could result in negative publicity or a negative impression of us in the investment community, and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock and adversely impact our relationships with employees, vendors, creditors and other business partners; and 
                
    we would continue to face the risks that we currently face as a publicly traded company.
