ATEL 12, LLC    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited)  

 1. Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:  

   ATEL 12, LLC (the  Company  or the  Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on January 25, 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the  principal operations ). From its inception into the third quarter of 2013, the Company s Managing Member was ATEL Associates 12, LLC ( AA12 ), a Nevada limited liability company. Effective September 30, 2013, AA12 was merged into ATEL Financial
Services, LLC ( AFS ) (the  Managing Member  or  Manager ), a California limited liability company, which assumed the role of Managing Member of the Company. The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030. As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member.  

 As of September 30, 2016, cumulative contributions, net of rescissions and/or redemptions, totaling $29.9 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received and 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding.  

 The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement, as amended. On January 1, 2016, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement. Prior thereto, the Company was in its acquisition phase and was making distributions on a monthly and quarterly basis. During the liquidation phase, periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.  

 These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies:  

 Basis of presentation:  

 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Managing Member, necessary for a fair statement of financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  

 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results from operations.  

 Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.  

 In preparing the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after September 30, 2016, up until the issuance of the financial statements. No events were noted which would require additional disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.  

 Use of estimates:  

 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during  

7 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

ATEL 12, LLC    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited) 

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowances for doubtful accounts and reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.  

 Segment reporting:  

 The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.  

 The primary geographic regions in which the Company sought leasing opportunities were North America and Europe. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 100% of the Company s operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in North America.  

 Accounts receivable  

 Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.  

 Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis. Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.  

 Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with lease or note payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon management s judgment, such leases or notes may be placed in non-accrual status. Leases or notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. Until such time, revenues on operating leases
are recognized on a cash basis. All payments received on amounts billed under direct financing leases and notes receivable are applied only against outstanding principal balances.  

 Financing receivables  

 In addition to the allowance established for delinquent accounts receivable, the total allowance related solely to financing receivables also includes anticipated impairment charges on notes receivable and direct financing leases.  

 Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due. If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary. This analysis
considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent. Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.  

 The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

ATEL 12, LLC    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited) 

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents. The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted
estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.  

 Investment in securities:  

 Purchased securities  

 Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost. Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary. Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital. Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Purchased securities totaled $272 thousand and $300 thousand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company recognized gains of $62 thousand on the disposition of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company did not recognize any gains or losses in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company recognized gains of $62 thousand and $10 thousand on the disposition of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

 Warrants  

 Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are reflected at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet as determined by the Managing Member. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $2 thousand, on fair valuation of its warrants. The Company did not reflect unrealized gains or losses in the three months ended September 30, 2016. By comparison, during the prior year three and nine month periods, the Company recorded unrealized losses of $25 thousand and $6 thousand, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the estimated fair value of the Company s portfolio of warrants amounted to $329 thousand and $327 thousand, respectively. There were no exercises of warrants, net or otherwise, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

 Per Unit data:  

 The Company issues only one class of Units, none of which are considered dilutive. Net income and distributions per Unit are based upon the weighted average number of Other Members Units outstanding during the period.  

 Fair Value Measurement:  

 Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:  

 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, generally on a national exchange.  

9 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

ATEL 12, LLC    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Unaudited) 

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.  

 Level 3   Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  

 The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments. Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes. Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including
discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values. As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties. Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies. The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.  

 Recent accounting pronouncements:  

 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its impact on operations and financial reporting.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). The main objective of this Update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new standard will require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases with lease terms greater than 12 months in the statement of financial position. Lessor accounting per ASU 2016-02 is mostly unchanged from the previous lease accounting GAAP. Certain changes were made to the lessor accounting guidance in order to align the lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Similar to the previous guidance,
lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. Lessors in operating leases will continue to

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 recognize the underlying asset and recognize income on a straight-line basis. Lessors determine whether a lease is a sale of the underlying asset based on whether the lessee effectively obtains control of the underlying assets. ASU-2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). The new standard provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt
securities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU-2014-15 ). The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures.  

 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and in August 2015, issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ). ASU 2015-14 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.  

 3. Notes receivable, net:  

 The Company has various notes receivable from borrowers who have financed the purchase of equipment through the Company. At September 30, 2016, the terms of the notes receivable are 36 months and bear interest at rates ranging from 11.88% to 14.30% per annum. The notes are generally secured by the equipment financed and have maturity dates ranging from 2016 through 2017. The Company had neither notes in non-accrual status nor impaired notes at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 4. Allowance for credit losses: - (continued) 

 The Company evaluates the credit quality of its financing receivables on a scale equivalent to the following quality indicators related to corporate risk profiles:  

 Pass   Any account whose lessee/debtor, co-lessee/debtor or any guarantor has a credit rating on publicly traded or privately placed debt issues as rated by Moody s or S P for either Senior Unsecured debt, Long Term Issuer rating or Issuer rating that are in the tiers of ratings generally recognized by the investment community as constituting an Investment Grade credit rating; or, has been determined by the Manager to be an Investment Grade Equivalent or High Quality Corporate Credit per its Credit Policy or has a Not Rated internal rating by the Manager and the account is not considered by the Chief
Credit Officer of the Manager to fall into one of the three risk profiles below.  

 Special Mention   Any traditional corporate type account with potential weaknesses (e.g. large net losses or major industry downturns) or, any growth capital account that has less than three months of cash as of the end of the calendar quarter to fund their continuing operations. These accounts deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.  

 Substandard   Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected. Such accounts are on the Manager s Credit Watch List.  

 Doubtful   Any account where the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Accordingly, an account that is so classified is on the Manager s Credit Watch List, and has been declared in default and the Manager has repossessed, or is attempting to repossess, the equipment it financed. This category includes impaired notes and leases as applicable.  

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s financing receivables by credit quality indicator and by class of financing receivables are as follows (excludes initial direct costs) (in thousands):

 4. Allowance for credit losses: - (continued) 

The Company had neither financing receivables in non-accrual status nor impaired financing receivables at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of the same respective dates, certain investments in financing receivables with related accounts receivable past due more than 90 days were still on an accrual basis based on management s assessment of the collectability of such receivables. However, these accounts receivable were fully reserved and included in the allowance for doubtful accounts presented above.  

 5. Investments in equipment and leases, net:  

 The Company s investment in equipment and leases consists of the following (in thousands):  

Impairment of investments in leases:  

 Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.  

 The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate. In addition, the Company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract. An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted
future rents from the existing lease contract, if any. The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date. Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances. As a result of these reviews, management determined that no impairment losses existed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

6. Related party transactions:  

 The terms of the Operating Agreement provide that the Managing Member and/or affiliates are entitled to receive certain fees for equipment management and resale and for management of the Company.  

 The Operating Agreement allows for the reimbursement of costs incurred by Managing Member and/or affiliates for providing administrative services to the Company. Administrative services provided include Company accounting, investor relations, legal counsel and lease and equipment documentation. The Managing Member is not reimbursed for services whereby it is entitled to receive a separate fee as compensation for such services, such as management of investments. The Company would be liable for certain future costs to be incurred by the Managing Member to manage the administrative services provided to the Company.  

 Each of AFS and ATEL Leasing Corporation ( ALC ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group and performs services for the Company on behalf of the Managing Member. Acquisition services, equipment management, lease administration and asset disposition services are performed by ALC; investor relations, communications and general administrative services are performed by AFS.  

 Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member or its affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company. These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as managed assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred. The Managing Member believes that the costs reimbursed are the lower of (i) actual costs incurred on behalf of the Company or (ii) the amount the Company would be required to pay independent parties for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location.

7. Non-recourse debt:  

 At September 30, 2016, non-recourse debt consists of notes payable to financial institutions. The notes are due in monthly installments. Interest on the notes is at fixed rates ranging from 1.97% to 2.39% per annum. The notes are secured by assignments of lease payments and pledges of assets. At September 30, 2016, gross lease rentals totaled $699 thousand over the remaining lease terms, and the carrying value of the pledged assets is $1.4 million. The notes mature at various dates from 2017 through 2018.  

 The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by liens granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or
liability of the Company. Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lenders, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties  signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations. Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no
material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure.  

 Future minimum payments of non-recourse debt are as follows (in thousands):  

8. Commitments:  

 At September 30, 2016, the Company had no commitments to purchase lease assets or fund investments in notes receivable.

 9. Members  capital:  

 A total of 2,992,482 Units were issued and outstanding at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Fund was authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 total Units.  

 Fund distributions are to be allocated 7.5% to the Managing Member and 92.5% to the Other Members. Distributions to the Other Members were as follows (in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data):  

10. Fair value measurements:  

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis.  

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis. By comparison, certain investment securities deemed impaired were measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2015.  

 The fair value adjustments utilized the following methodology:  

 Warrants (recurring)  

 Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period. The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the calculated fair values of the Fund s warrant portfolio are $329 thousand and $327 thousand, respectively. Such valuations are
classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  

 The fair value of warrants that were accounted for on a recurring basis as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and classified as level 3 are as follows (in thousands):  

Impaired investment securities (non-recurring)  

 The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost. The investment securities are adjusted for impairment, if any, based upon factors which include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital.  

 The Company did not record any non-recurring fair value adjustments on any investment securities during the first three and nine months of 2016. During 2015, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $6 thousand to reduce the cost basis of an impaired investment security. The reduction in value was based on a market approach technique and uses inputs that reflect qualitative and quantitative information provided

 by the management of the investee. Such information indicated reduced growth opportunity and eventual reduction in cash flows and revenues. Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the aforementioned impaired investment securities were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  

 The following tables present the fair value measurement of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

The following tables summarize the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s recurring and non-recurring fair value calculation categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.  

 The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance. Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

 10. Fair value measurements: - (continued) 

 Cash and cash equivalents  

 The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.  

 Notes receivable  

 The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.  

 Investment in securities  

 The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.  

 Non-recourse debt  

 The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  

 Commitments and Contingencies  

 Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.  

 The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.  

 The following tables present estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

 Statements contained in this Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including, fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of
equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital. The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees. The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the market for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms. Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.  

  Overview   

 ATEL 12, LLC (the  Company  or the  Fund ) is a California limited liability company that was formed in January 2007 for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities, as well as in real estate, growth capital investment activities and green technologies (the  principal operations ), primarily in the United States.  

 The Company may continue until December 31, 2030. However, pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities on January 1, 2016. Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.  

  Results of Operations   

 The three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015  

 The Company had net income of $221 thousand and $186 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Results for the third quarter of 2016 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total operating expenses when compared to the prior year period.  

 Revenues  

 Total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $61 thousand or 12%, as compared to the prior year period. Such decrease was primarily due to a decline in operating lease revenues and an unfavorable change in gains and/or losses recognized on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes, partially offset by an increase in gain on sales of investment in securities.  

 Operating lease revenues declined by $114 thousand primarily as a result of run-off and sales of lease assets. The unfavorable change in gain and/or loss recognized on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes totaled $17 thousand as the Company recognized a loss of $4 thousand during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a gain of $13 thousand during the prior year period. Such unfavorable change was mainly due to a change in the mix of assets sold. The gain on sales of investment in securities increased by $61 thousand, as there was no disposal of investment in securities in 2015.  

 Expenses  

 Total expenses for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $96 thousand or 29%, as compared to the prior year period. The net decrease in expenses was primarily the result of reductions in depreciation expense and cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member.  

 The decrease in depreciation expense totaled $92 thousand and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets. Costs reimbursed to the Managing Member declined by $12 thousand due to lower allocated costs based, in part, on the Fund s declining asset base.  

22 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

The nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

 The Company had net income of $631 thousand and $734 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Results for the first nine months of 2016 reflect decreases in total revenues and total expenses when compared to the prior year period.  

 Revenues  

 Total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 declined by $876 thousand or 38%, as compared to the prior year period. The net reduction in total revenues was largely attributable to decreases in operating lease revenues and an unfavorable change in gains or losses on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes.  

 The decrease in operating lease revenues totaled $396 thousand and was primarily a result of continued run-off and sales of lease assets. The unfavorable change in gain and/or loss recognized on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes totaled $567 thousand as the Company recognized an $82 thousand loss during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a $485 thousand gain during the prior period. Such unfavorable change was mainly due to a change in the mix of assets sold.  

 Expenses  

 Total expenses for the nine months of 2016 decreased by $773 thousand or 50%, as compared to the prior year period. Such decrease was primarily the result of reductions in depreciation expense, asset management fees, taxes on income and franchise fees, and cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member.  

 The decrease in depreciation expense totaled $657 thousand and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets. Asset management fees paid to the Managing Member declined by $27 thousand as a result of the continued decline in managed assets and related lease revenue. Taxes on income and franchise fees declined by $33 thousand largely due to a lower estimated tax liability based on actual payments made in the prior year. Costs reimbursed to the Managing Member declined by $56 thousand due to lower allocated costs based, in part, on the Fund s declining asset base.  

  Capital Resources and Liquidity   

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.  

 The primary source of liquidity for the Company has been its cash flow from fixed-term leasing activities. As the lease terms expire, the Company will re-lease or sell the equipment. The future liquidity beyond the contractual minimum rentals will depend on the Company s success in remarketing or selling the equipment as it comes off rental.  

 The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.  

  Cash Flows   

 The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances and at that certain point in time. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

 The Company s critical accounting policies are described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   

  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

 The Company s Managing Member s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer ( Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, Management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

 The Company does not control the financial reporting process, and is solely dependent on the Management of the Managing Member, who is responsible for providing the Company with financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Managing Member s disclosure controls and procedures, as they are applicable to the Company, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a  et seq. ) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Changes in internal control   

 There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.
