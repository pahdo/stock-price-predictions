CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   

This
report includes forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. Words such as, but not limited to,  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate, 
 intend,   plan,   targets,   likely,   aim,   will, 
 would,   could,  and similar expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and future events and financial trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operation, business strategy and financial needs. Forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements about:  

our
    lack of products or revenues and the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture   

our
    very limited operating history and our unproven business plan;   

our
    history of losses;   

our
    ability to continue as a going concern;   

our
    ability to raise capital to fund our business plan, pay our operating expense and satisfy our obligations;   

conflicts
    of interest facing certain of our officers and directors;   

future
    reliance on third party manufacturers;   

our
    future ability to comply with government regulations;   

our
    lack of experience in selling, marketing or distributing products;   

our
    future ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships;   

our
    possible future dependence on licensing or collaboration agreements;   

the
    inability of Chong Corporation to protect the intellectual property which is licensed to us, and risks of possible third-party
    infringement of intellectual property rights;   

anti-takeover
    provisions of Delaware law;   

the
    dilution impact of the issuance of shares of our common stock upon a conversion of shares of our Series A 10% convertible
    preferred stock and as payment for dividends; and   

the
    impact of penny stock rules on the future trading in our common stock.   

You
should read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results
may be materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary
statements, Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible
for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake
no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence
of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on
these statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and our business.

NOTE
1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Nature
of Business   

VapAria
Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 21, 2009 under the
name OICco Acquisition IV, Inc.  

On
April 11, 2014 the Company entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Agreement )
with VapAria Solutions, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formerly known as VapAria Corporation ( VapAria Solutions )
and the shareholders of VapAria Solutions (the  VapAria Solutions Shareholders ) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire
100% of the outstanding capital stock of VapAria Solutions from the VapAria Solutions Shareholders in exchange for certain shares
of our capital stock. On July 31, 2014 all conditions precedent to the closing were satisfied, including the reconfirmation by
the investors of the prior purchase of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and the transaction closed.  

At
closing, we issued the VapAria Solutions Shareholders 36,000,000 shares of our common stock and 500,000 shares of our 10% Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for the common stock and preferred stock owned by the VapAria Solutions Shareholders.  

As
a result of the closing of this transaction, VapAria Solutions is now a wholly owned subsidiary of our company and its business
and operations represent those of our company.  

On
August 19, 2014 the board of directors of the Company and the holders of a majority of its issued and outstanding common stock
approved a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation changing the name of our company
to VapAria Corporation. The name change was effective on August 19, 2014. Our Board determined it was in our best interests to
change our corporate name to better reflect our business and operations following our recent acquisition of VapAria Solutions.  

The
Company is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, design and development of methods and medicants to address
chronic conditions with novel, vapor-centric approaches to pain management, appetite suppression, smoking cessation and various
sleep disorders.  

The
Company has limited operations and, as of September 30, 2016, had no employees. However, its executive officers and directors
have provided significant services to the Company without cash compensation.  

The
Company has a fiscal year end of December 31.  

Basis
of presentation   

Basis
of Presentation  - The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial
statements appearing in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the
period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

Reclassifications   
Certain reclassifications may have been made to our prior year s consolidated financial statements to conform to current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on our previously reported results of operations or accumulated deficit.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. Currently, the Company has limited cash and no source of revenue sufficient to cover its operations costs and allow
it to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital.  

NOTE
3   STOCKHOLDER S EQUITY   

In
January 2016 the Company issued 25,000,000 shares of common stock to Chong Corporation, a related entity, in exchange for five
exclusive, worldwide license agreements. We issued 5,000,000 shares for each of the license agreements, for an aggregate issuance
of 25,000,000 shares. In accordance with GAAP, the intellectual property is carried on the VapAria balance sheet at a fair value
of $100,772. The five license agreements are as follows:  

U.S.
Patent No.: 8,903228 issued on December 20, 2014 for a vapor delivery device;  

U.S.
Patent No.: 8,962,040 issued on February 24, 2015 for vaporized appetite suppression (hoodia);  

U.S.
Patent No.: 9,254,002 issued on February 9, 2016- for vaporization of a tobacco formulation;  

U.S.
Patent No.: 9,283,180 issued on March 15, 2016- for a vaporized sleep aid- LTV-(melatonin); and  

U.S.
Patent App. No.: 13/453,939 filed on April 12, 2012 for an enhanced vapor delivery system.  

On
May 23, 2016 the Company paid an annual dividend of 50,000 shares of common stock to the sole shareholder of our Series A Preferred
Stock, Chong Corporation, a related party.  

On
July 26, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent No.: 9,399,110 related to US Patent Application
No.: 13/453,939 filed on April 12, 2012 for an enhanced vapor delivery system. The issuance of this patent means that the entire
IP portfolio licensed by the Company in the January 2016 license agreement, which then included a total of four patents and one
patent application, is now five patents.  

On
September 30, 2016, the Company had 75,210,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  

NOTE
4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

During
the third quarter the Company borrowed from Chong Corporation, a related entity, an additional $50,000. The balance outstanding
at September 30, 2016 is $339,544. The loan is unsecured, noninterest bearing and due on demand.  

We
maintain our corporate offices at 5550 Nicollet Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55419. We lease these premises from 5550 Nicollet LLC,
an affiliate of Mr. Chong, under the terms of a three-year lease expiring in December 2016 at an annual rent of $9,000. We have
the right to renew the lease for an additional 12-month term at an annual rental of $9,180 upon 60-day notice prior to the expiration
of the initial term. Rent was $2,250 for this three-month period in both 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, $10,500 is due
to 5550 Nicollet LLC.  

NOTE
5   NOTE PAYABLE   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has a note payable in the amount of $50,000 due to an individual. The note was issued on May
30, 2013 and bears eight per cent (8%) annual interest. The note was extended June 30, 2016 and all principal and accrued interest
is now due and payable December 31, 2016.  

NOTE
6   CONVERTIBLE NOTE   

The
Company assumed an unsecured convertible note for $40,000 that was issued on July 14, 2014 as part of the share exchange. The
note was recently extended to mature on December 31, 2016 and continues to bear interest at 10% per annum. The note is convertible
into shares of our common stock at $0.08 per share. The Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting
treatment under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and determined that the instrument does not qualify for
derivative accounting. The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial
conversion feature and determined that the instrument does not have a beneficial conversion feature.  

The
note was originally due on September 1, 2014. The Company entered into a note amendment on September 1, 2014 and the due date
was extended to December 1, 2014. On December 1, 2014, the Company extended the note again to December 31, 2015. On December 31,
2015 the note was again extended to July 31, 2016 and on July 31, 2016 it was extended to December 31, 2016. The Company analyzed
the modification of the term under ASC 470-60  Trouble Debt Restructurings  and ASC 470-50  Extinguishment of
Debt . The Company determined the modification is not substantial and the transaction should not be accounted for as an
extinguishment with the old debt written off and the new debt initially recorded at fair value with a new effective interest rate.  

NOTE
7   COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES   

Relating
to the December 2013 Agreement with Chong Corporation, beginning in the calendar year in which the first licensed products or
licensed services takes place, but not prior to January 1, 2015, the Company is required to pay to Chong Corporation, a related
entity, a 3% royalty for revenues with a $50,000 annual minimum royalty commitment.  

The
December 31, 2013 Agreement with Chong Corporation also requires us to pay for the costs associated with maintaining the patent
applications and patents licensed to us. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no reimbursable costs.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements
that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing
of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors,
including those set forth under  Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information  appearing earlier in
this report, Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe, 
 intend,   may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions
to identify forwardlooking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance,
our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forwardlooking
statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors
described throughout this report.  

Overview
and plan of operations   

We
are a pre-clinical specialty pharmaceutical company. Prior to forming VapAria Solutions in 2010, our management had more than
25 years  collective experience in vaporization and vapor delivery of medicants, having been partners in a joint venture
with pioneers in the industry and having had undertaken significant work internationally researching and developing products,
shepherding them through the patent process and introducing them into the U.S. wholesale and retail supply chain.  

Our
initial goal was to leverage rights we acquired in December 2013 from an affiliate to develop and successfully launch a product
in partnership with well-capitalized and experienced industry participants based on our exclusive license and exclusive options
to license patented and patent-pending technologies under the December 2013 Agreement and formulations designed to significantly
improve on current electronic nicotine delivery systems and other consumer products in the marketplace. During the first nine
months of 2016, in addition to discussions with third party financing sources, we continued to engage in substantive discussions
with several international companies which have expressed interest in our licensed technology in pursuit of this strategy.  

In
mid-2015 we adjusted our business focus owing to continuing research, development and design throughout and, thus, we completed
a full design of a product embodiment based on our proprietary technology, authorized the production of fully functional prototypes
and are scheduling pre-clinical assessments for the prototypes. In the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 we spent $95,172 and
$69,316 respectively, in research and development costs related to these efforts. The first stage prototype was completed in the
first quarter of 2016, the second stage prototypes were delivered in the second quarter of 2016 and in the third quarter of 2016
we engaged an industry expert with 28 years of relevant experience to design IND-enabling studies that should take from pre-clinical
stage to clinical stage and make the FDA 505(b)(2) pathway to regulatory approval and commercialization available to us. Certain
of the costs associated with these studies are expected to be funded with the $1,000,0000 to $2,000,000 that we need to raise
in the next 12 months to remain a going concern. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund these costs, our ability
to continue our commercialization efforts will be adversely impacted.  

Our
management, through the Chong Corporation, an affiliated entity that is the licensor of the intellectual property rights we acquired
in December 2013 and January 2016, has built an extensive and robust portfolio of intellectual property that includes patented
and patent-pending methods of vaporization and patented and patent-pending medicants and herbal remedies identified for their
effectiveness and suitability to address the markets identified above. Historically we have relied upon related party loans that,
as of September 30, 2016, total $339,544, and the $110,000 from the sale of our securities in private transactions that occurred
in the first quarter of 2015 to provide working capital. Our management has worked without cash compensation. In the first nine
months of 2016, the loan increased by $166,000 and these proceeds were used to pay expenses associated with research, development
and design, patent protection prosecution activities and ordinary business expenses associated with identifying, meeting with
and negotiating with potential business partners and our general operating expenses, including the payment of our obligations.
We estimate that we will need to raise between $1 million and $2 million over the next 12 months to continue to implement our
business plan.  

We
may seek to raise the necessary capital through future public or private debt or equity offerings of our securities, although
we do not have any commitments from any third parties to provide any capital to us. While we believe that the exclusive rights
to the proprietary technology on which our business is predicated could provide us with a significant competitive advantage if
we can bring one or more products to market, our ability to accomplish that in the near term is dependent on a successful prototype
and positive pre-clinical assessments of the prototype. Given the current lack of a public market for our common stock, our status
as a pre-clinical stage company and the difficulties small companies experience in accessing the capital markets, we expect to
encounter difficulties in pursuing public or private capital raises. We may also seek to minimize our capital needs by securing
partnerships or joint ventures with well capitalized companies in the pharmaceutical or OTC consumer products industries. Until
such time as we are able to raise all or a portion of the necessary capital, our ability to continue to implement our business
plan will be in jeopardy.  

Going
concern   

For
the third quarter of 2016 we reported a net loss of $59,076 compared to a net loss of $110,295 for the same period in 2015. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we reported a net loss of $183,268 and net cash used in operating activities of $167,456.
For the first nine months of 2015 we reported a net loss of $248,087 and net cash used in operations of $158,083. At September
30, 2016 we had cash on hand of $4,459, a working capital deficit of $488,181 and an accumulated deficit of $1,101,552. The report
of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our minimal cash and no
source of revenues which are sufficient to cover our operating costs. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to raise capital, develop a
source of revenues, report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their
entire investment in our company.  

Results
of operations   

We
did not generate any revenues from our operations in any of the 2016 or 2015 periods. Our total operating expenses for the third
quarter of 2016 decreased 47% over those reported in the comparable period in 2015 and 27% for the first nine months of 2016 as
compared to the first nine months of 2015. General and administrative expenses, which include amortization, rent, non-cash compensation
and IP related expenses, decreased 62% in in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 and 64% for the
first nine months of 2016 from the first nine months of 2015. The amounts recorded in 2015 reflect a one-time cost associated
with IP maintenance so the decrease seen in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is expected.  

Research
and development expenses decreased in the third quarter of 2016 by 19% from the comparable 2015 period. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 the overall increase over the same period in 2015 is 37%. Professional fees decreased 67% for the third quarter
of 2016 and 47% for the first nine months of 2016 from the comparable 2015 periods. The decreases in the 2016 periods over the
comparable 2015 periods is directly attributable to higher legal fees incurred in 2015 relating to due diligence costs associated
with ongoing discussions and negotiations with potential licensees or product development partners. During 2015 we also incurred
one-time legal fees associated with securing a freedom to operate opinion for which there was not a comparable expense in 2016.  

We
expect that our operating expenses will increase as we continue to develop our business and we devote additional resources towards
promoting that growth, most notably reflected in anticipated increases in general overhead, salaries for personnel and technical
resources, as well as increased costs associated with our SEC reporting obligations. However, as set forth elsewhere in this report,
our ability to continue to develop our business and achieve our operational goals is dependent upon our ability to raise significant
additional working capital. As the availability of this capital is unknown, we are unable to quantify at this time the expected
increases in operating expenses in future periods.  

Liquidity
and capital resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. As of September 30, 2016 we had $4,459
in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $488,181 as compared to $5,915 in cash and cash equivalents and
a working capital deficit of $317,564 at December 31, 2015. Our current liabilities increased 52% at September 30, 2016 from December
31, 2015, reflecting increases in interest payable and in the loan amount from a related party. Our principal source of operating
capital during the first nine months of 2016 came from additional borrowing from a related party which lent us an additional $166,000.  

We
do not have any commitments for capital expenditures. Our working capital is not sufficient to fund our operations for at least
the next 12 months and to satisfy our obligations as they become due. In June 2016, the holder of a $50,000 principal amount note
agreed to the extension of the due date of the note from June 30, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The remaining note in the principal
amount of $40,000 is convertible into 500,000 shares of our common stock at the option of the holder and is now due December 31,
2016. While there are no assurances the holder will elect to convert the note, in that event we granted the holder demand and
piggyback registration rights for those shares. We also owe a related party $339,544 which is due on demand. We do not have the
funds necessary to repay these obligations or to fund the costs associated with filing a registration statement if the noteholder
converts the note and exercises its registration rights. As described earlier in this report, we will need to raise between $1,000,000
and $2,000,000 in additional capital during the next 12 months. As we do not have any firm commitments for all or any portion
of this necessary capital, there are no assurances we will have sufficient funds to fund our operating expenses and continued
development of our products and to satisfy our obligations as they become due. In that event, our ability to continue as a going
concern is in jeopardy.  

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities   

We
used $167,456 of cash in our operating activities in the first nine months of 2016 a slight increase when compared to $158,083
used by our operating activities in the same period in 2015.  

Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities   

There
was no net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net
cash provided by financing for the first nine months of 2016 consisted of $166,000 in borrowings from Chong Corporation, a related
party, compared to a capital raise of $110,000 and the net borrowing of $51,000 from Chong Corporation in the first nine months
of 2015.  

Non
cash investing and financing activities   

Dividends
of common stock issued on the shares of outstanding Series A 10% convertible preferred stock resulted in $7,500 in non-cash financing.  

Critical
accounting policies   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable allowances and impairment of long-lived assets. We also have other key accounting policies, which
involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described
in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2016 appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

There
are no recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that require
adoption.  

Off
balance sheet arrangements   

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement 
generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party,
under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained
or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market
risk support for such assets.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Not
applicable for a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .   

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.
The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information relating to our company
required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the presence of continuing material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. These material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting result from limited segregation of duties
and limited multiple level of review in the financial close process.  

The
existence of the continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting increases the risk that a future
restatement of our financials is possible. In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we will need to expand our accounting
resources. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal
control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis, however, we do not expect that the deficiencies in our disclosure controls
will be remediated until such time as we have remediated the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
Subject to the availability of sufficient capital, we expect to expand our accounting resources during 2016 in an effort to remediate
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
