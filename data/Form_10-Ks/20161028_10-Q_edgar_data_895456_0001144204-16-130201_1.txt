1.    INTERIM
                                         FINANCIAL REPORTING  

In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial results. All such adjustments reflected in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are considered
to be of a normal and recurring nature. The results of the operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the whole year. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2.    TRADE
                                         RECEIVABLES  

Trade receivables are presented net of the related allowance
for uncollectible accounts of approximately $1,011,000, $820,000 and $966,000 at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September
30, 2015, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on the relative age and size of trade receivable
balances. Our credit policy generally provides that trade receivables will be deemed uncollectible and written-off once we have
pursued all reasonable efforts to collect on the account. 

3.    INVENTORIES  

Inventories, net of reserves, are comprised
of the following: 

4.    SUPPLEMENTAL
                                         CASH FLOW INFORMATION  

Supplemental cash flow information is as follows: 

5.    PER SHARE
                                         INFORMATION  

Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed
by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. The diluted earnings per share computation includes common share equivalents, when dilutive. There are no adjustments
to net income necessary in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. 

A reconciliation of the shares used
in the basic and diluted income per common share computation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
as follows: 

Weighted average shares that were antidilutive and therefore
not included in the calculation of earnings per share were 63,705 and 80,170 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Weighted average shares that were antidilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of earnings per
share were 125,222 and 81,880 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, diluted earnings per share of common stock is equal to basic earnings per share of common stock due
to the net loss. 

6.    RECENT
                                         FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation
  Stock Compensation (Topic 718). Some share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target to be achieved
before the employee can benefit from the award, also require an employee to render service until the performance target is achieved.
In some cases, the terms of an award may provide that the performance target could be achieved after an employee completes the
requisite service period. That is, the employee would be entitled to benefit from the award regardless of whether the employee
is rendering service on the date the performance target is achieved. Some entities account for those performance targets as performance
conditions that affect the vesting of the award and, therefore, do not reflect the performance target in the estimate of the grant-date
fair value. Others treat them as nonvesting conditions that affect the grant-date fair value of the award. The amendments apply
to reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance
target can be achieved after the requisite service period. The update is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income
Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20). The objective of this update is to simplify the income statement
presentation requirements in Subtopic 225-20 by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. Extraordinary items are events
and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence. Eliminating the extraordinary
classification simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration.
The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively
to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest
  Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). The objective of this update is to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs,
the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The amendments in this update
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis,
wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying
the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting
principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a
description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial
statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The adoption of this standard did not have an
effect on our consolidated financial statements as ASU 2015-15 permitted debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement
to remain as an asset and be amortized over the remaining term of the line of credit agreement. 

Accounting standards not yet adopted   

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in this update supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic
605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the
Codification. In addition, the amendments supersede the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition Construction-Type
and Production-Type Contracts, and create new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers.
In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14. The amendments in this update defer the effective date of Update
2014-09. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance
in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We have not yet determined the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation
of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). Currently, there is no guidance in GAAP about management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or
to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments should
reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require an evaluation
every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s
plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s
plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment
for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The update is effective
for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet
determined the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory
(Topic 330). The amendments in this update require an entity to measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured
using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP
with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities, the amendments
in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of
an interim or annual reporting period. We have not yet determined the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income
Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this update will simplify the presentation
of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of
an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. For public business entities,
the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. We have not yet determined the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842). The amendments in this update will require lessees to recognize (with the exception of short-term leases) a lease
liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and
a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset
for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting
for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. For public business
entities, the amendments in this update are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted for all entities upon issuance. We have not yet determined the impact this
ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation
  Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The amendments in this update were issued as part of the FASB s initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for
employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the amendments in this update eliminate the guidance
in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment.
For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted for all entities upon issuance. We have not yet determined
the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing
implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. The Update includes targeted improvements based on
input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. The update seeks to
proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity
of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis. The amendments in this update are
effective at the same time as ASU 2014-09. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit
plans should apply the guidance in update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. We have not yet determined the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12: Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which provides narrow scope improvements
and practical expedients related to ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The purpose of ASU 2016-12
is to clarify certain narrow aspects of Topic 606 such as assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes
and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts
at transition, and technical correction. The standard has the same effective date as ASU 2014-09. Public business entities, certain
not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We have not yet determined
the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, addressing eight specific cash flow issues
in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31,
2017, and for interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact this ASU
will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

7.    INCOME
                                         TAXES  

We file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction
and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. Federal tax examinations for years before 2012.
In 2014, we were subjected to an IRS examination for our consolidated U.S. Federal return for the year 2011. There were no adjustments
to our return as a result of that examination. State jurisdictions that remain subject to examination range from 2011 to 2015.
Foreign jurisdiction tax returns that remain subject to examination range from 2010 to 2015 for Canada and from 2010 to 2015 for
Puerto Rico. We do not believe we have any uncertain tax positions. 

Our policy is to accrue interest and penalties on any
uncertain tax position as a component of income tax expense. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015,
no such expenses were recognized. 

We provided for income taxes at an estimated effective
tax rate of 34.0% and 34.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the third quarter of 2016
and 2015, we reduced our estimated tax rate for the expected permanent capital investment in the Dominican Republic, which reduces
the amount of dividends that we need to provide for U.S. income taxes. 

8.    INTANGIBLE
                                         ASSETS  

A schedule of intangible assets is as follows: 

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $32,924
and $33,726 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $99,383 and $101,345 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average amortization period for patents is 15 years.

years ending December 31,:  

9.     CAPITAL
                                         STOCK  

On May 7, 2014, our shareholders approved the 2014 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ). The 2014 Plan includes 500,000 of our common shares that may be granted under various
types of awards as described in the 2014 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, we were authorized to issue 276,695 shares under this
plan. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, we issued 3,672 and 10,596 shares, respectively, of common stock to members of our Board of Directors. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded compensation expense of $42,000 and $126,000, respectively, which was the
fair market value of the shares on the grant dates. These shares are fully vested. 

Service Based Restricted Stock  

In the first quarter of 2016, we issued 30,000 restricted
stock units to certain members of our management that will be settled in one share of common stock of the company per unit. These
restricted stock units vest in increments of 25% per year over the next four years. We valued the units at an average fair value
of $11.56 per unit, which was the closing price of our stock on the last trading date prior to the grant date. Also in the first
quarter of 2016, we issued an additional 2,000 restricted stock units to a member of management. These units vest the same as
the first issuance. We valued the units at an average fair value of $10.29 per unit, which was the closing price of our stock
on the last trading date prior to the grant date. In the first quarter of 2015, we issued 28,000 restricted stock units to certain
members of our management that will be settled in one share of common stock of the company per unit. These restricted stock units
vest in increments of 25% per year from the grant date. We valued the units at a fair value of $13.42 per unit, which was the
closing price of our stock on the last trading date prior to the grant date. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we
recorded a net credit of $4,668 as a result of employee forfeitures, related to restricted stock units. For the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we recorded expense of $41,109 related to restricted stock units. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we recorded expense of $120,714 and $123,328, respectively, related to restricted stock units. 

Performance Based Restricted Stock  

In the first quarter of 2016, we made available up to
43,000 performance based restricted stock units to certain members of our management. Shares underlying the performance based
restricted stock units will be issued upon achieving certain established EPS goals at the end of fiscal year 2017. In the first
quarter of 2015, we made available up to 32,000 performance based restricted stock units to certain members of our management.
Shares underlying the performance based restricted stock units will be issued upon achieving certain established EPS goals at
the end of fiscal year 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not record any expense related
to these performance based restricted stock units as it is uncertain if we will reach the performance goals. 

Stock Options  

In the first quarter of 2016, we issued 30,000 stock
options to certain members of our management. These stock options vest in increments of 20% per year over the next five years.
The options are exercisable at $11.56 per option, which was the closing price of our stock on the last trading date prior to the
grant date. We have determined the fair value of the options to be $3.41 per option using the Black Scholes calculation. The significant
assumptions utilized for the Black Scholes calculations consist of an expected life of 6.5 years, historical volatility of 42.32%,
a risk free interest rate of 2.06%, a dividend yield of 3.81% and an initial employee forfeiture rate of 7.7%. Our expected life
estimate is based on the sum of the vesting terms divided by the number of vesting tranches. Also in the first quarter of 2016,
we issued an additional 2,000 stock options to a member of our management. These units vest the same as the first issuance. The
options are exercisable at $10.29 per option, which was the closing price of our stock on the last trading date prior to the grant
date. We have determined the fair value of the options to be $2.84 per option using the Black Scholes calculation. The significant
assumptions utilized for the Black Scholes calculations consist of an expected life of 6.5 years, historical volatility of 42.32%,
a risk free interest rate of 1.88%, a dividend yield of 4.30% and an initial employee forfeiture rate of 7.7%. In the first quarter
of 2015, we issued 28,000 stock options to certain members of our management. These stock options vest in increments of 20% per
year from the grant date. The options are exercisable at $13.42 per option, which was the closing price of our stock on the last
trading date prior to the grant date. We have determined the fair value of the options to be $4.70 per option using the Black
Scholes calculation. The significant assumptions utilized for the Black Scholes calculations consist of an expected life of 6.5
years, historical volatility of 46.20%, a risk free interest rate of 1.92%, a dividend yield of 2.99% and an initial employee
forfeiture rate of 3.8%. Our expected life estimate is based on the sum of the vesting terms divided by the number of vesting
tranches.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded
net credit of $10,032 as a result of employee forfeitures, related to stock option issuances. For the three months ended September
30, 2015, we recorded expense of $12,368, related to stock option issuances. For the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015,
we recorded expense of $20,133 and $37,107, respectively, related to stock option issuances. 

The following summarizes stock option transactions from
January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016: 

Repurchase of Common Stock  

In March 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $7,500,000 of common shares outstanding in open market or privately negotiated transactions over the next
12 months. Purchases of stock under this program were funded with borrowings from our amended and restated revolving credit facility.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were 39,613 and 145,784 shares repurchased and retired, for $410,646
and $1,646,587, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we have $5,853,413 of availability remaining under the March 2016 authorization. 

10.    SEGMENT
                                         INFORMATION  

We have identified three reportable segments: Wholesale,
Retail and Military. Wholesale includes sales of footwear and accessories to several classifications of retailers, including sporting
goods stores, outdoor specialty stores, mail order catalogs, independent retailers, mass merchants, retail uniform stores, and
specialty safety shoe stores. Retail includes all sales from our consumer websites, stores and all sales in our Lehigh division.
Military includes sales to the U.S. Military. The following is a summary of segment results for the Wholesale, Retail, and Military
segments. 

Segment asset information is not prepared or
used to assess segment performance. 

In October 2010, we entered into
a financing agreement with PNC Bank ( PNC ) to provide a $70 million credit facility. In December 2014, we amended
and restated the credit facility to increase the facility to $75 million and extend the term of the facility an additional five
years. The credit facility s base interest rate is the current prime rate less 0.25%, however the credit facility provides
us the option to borrow on up to eight fixed loans at LIBOR plus 1.25% in accordance with the 2014 amended and restated credit
agreement. The LIBOR rate is determined based on the fixed loan maturities, which vary from 30, 60, 90, or 180 days. As of September
30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, we had approximately $23.0 million, $17.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively,
in fixed LIBOR borrowings under the credit facility. The amended and restated credit facility matures in November 2019. 

The total amount available under
our amended and restated revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of
accounts receivable and inventory. As of September 30, 2016, we had $31.0 million in borrowings under this facility and total
capacity of $70.0 million. 

Our amended and restated credit
facility contains a restrictive covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. This restrictive covenant
is only in effect upon a triggering event taking place (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement). At
September 30, 2016, there was no triggering event and the covenant was not in effect. 

We have no other long-term debt
maturities. 

12.    FINANCIAL
                                         INSTRUMENTS  

Generally accepted accounting standards establish a framework
for measuring fair value. The fair value accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard clarifies how to measure fair value as permitted under other
accounting pronouncements. 

The fair value accounting standard defines fair value
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
This standard also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This
hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels
of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level
                                         1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
                                         2   Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such
                                         as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
                                         for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other
                                         inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   

Level
                                         3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and
                                         that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain
                                         pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant
                                         unobservable inputs.   

The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, other receivables
and accounts payable approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Accounts receivable
consists primarily of amounts due from our customers, net of allowances. Other receivables consist primarily of amounts due from
employees (sales persons  advances in excess of commissions earned and employee travel advances); other customer receivables,
net of allowances; and expected insurance recoveries. The carrying amounts of our revolving line of credit and other short-term
financing obligations also approximate fair value, as they are comparable to the available financing in the marketplace during
the year .  

13.     Reorganizational
                                         Charge   

During the third quarter of 2016,
we implemented initiatives to reorganize the company to maximize profitability, drive long-term revenue growth and maximize shareholder
value. The costs related to this reorganization are recorded to  Reorganizational Charge  in our condensed consolidated
statement of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, costs of approximately $1,160,000 were recognized
related to these initiatives, which consisted of severance costs. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $878,000 in accrued
reorganizing charges recorded to  Accrued expenses   Salaries and wages  in our condensed consolidated balance
sheet relating to future severance payments. We do not expect to incur additional costs related to our reorganization efforts. 

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information
derived from our Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, expressed as a percentage of net sales. The discussion
that follows the table should be read in conjunction with our Interim Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015  

Net sales.  Net sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $73.2 million compared to $70.0 million for the same period in 2015. Wholesale sales for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $52.9 million compared to $54.7 million for the same period in 2015. The $1.8 million decrease in Wholesale
sales was the result of a $2.8 million decrease in our lifestyle footwear category and a $1.2 million decrease in our outdoor
footwear category. These declines were partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in our commercial military footwear category,
a $0.6 million increase in our duty category, and a $0.4 increase in our work footwear category. We believe the declines were
principally the result of weak store traffic across retail, which created an inventory overhang in our channels of distribution
that continued to impact our lifestyle and outdoor footwear shipments during the third quarter. Retail sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were flat when compared to the same period in 2015. Military segment sales for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $10.1 million, compared to $5.1 million in the same period in 2015. In early 2013, we received an order
to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce  Hot Weather  combat boots. Shipments to the U.S. Military for
both periods were made under this order. In early 2016, we received an order to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce
 Temperate Weather  combat boots. We began shipping under this order in March 2016. 

Gross margin.  Gross margin for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $19.8 million, or 27.0% of net sales, compared to $22.1 million, or 31.6% of net sales, in the same
period last year. Wholesale gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $15.1 million, or 28.6% of net
sales, compared to $16.8 million, or 30.8% of net sales, in the same period last year. The 220 basis point decrease was
primarily due to higher manufacturing costs associated with the ramp up of production at our manufacturing facility in Puerto
Rico and to a lesser extent lower average selling prices. The Retail gross margin for the three months ended September 30,
2016 was $4.5 million, or 44.2% of net sales, compared to $4.6 million, or 44.6% of net sales, for the same period in 2015.
Military gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.1 million, or 0.9% of net sales, compared to $0.7
million, or 13.9% of net sales, for the same period in 2015. The decrease in margin was due to higher manufacturing costs
associated with the ramp up of production at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. 

SG A expenses.  SG A expenses were $17.7 million,
or 24.2% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $19.2 million, or 27.5% of net sales, a year ago. The $1.5 million
decrease is primarily related to lower advertising expense of $0.8 million, lower compensation expense of $0.3 million, and lower
freight and handling expenses of $0.3 million. 

Reorganizational Charge.  During the quarter ended September
30, 2016, we recorded $1.2 million in a reorganizational charge consisting of severance. The purpose of this reorganization was
to maximize profitability, drive long-term revenue growth and maximize shareholder value. 

Interest expense.  Interest expense was $0.2 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income taxes.  Income tax expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $0.2 million, compared to $0.9 million expense for the same period a year ago. We provided for income taxes
at effective tax rates of 34.0% for 2016 and 32.5% for 2015.  In the third
quarters of 2016 and 2015, we reduced our estimated effective tax rate for the full year for the expected permanent capital investment
in the Dominican Republic which reduces the amount of dividends that we need to provide for U.S. income taxes.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015  

Net sales.  Net sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $193.3 million compared to $204.0 million for the same period in 2015. Wholesale sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $134.6 million compared to $159.6 million for the same period in 2015. The $25.0 million decrease in Wholesale
sales was the result of a $8.4 million decrease in our work footwear category, a $7.5 million decrease in our outdoor footwear
category, a $6.9 million decrease in our lifestyle footwear category, a $4.4 million decrease in our western footwear category
and a $2.0 decrease in apparel sales. These declines were partially offset by a $3.9 million increase in our commercial military
footwear category. We believe the declines were principally the result of warmer temperatures, weak store traffic across retail
and the softening of local economies, especially those tied to oil   gas production, which created an inventory overhang in
our channels of distribution that continued to impact fill-in of our Georgia Boot, Rocky and Durango brands during the first three
quarters of 2016. Retail sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $32.2 million compared to $32.3 million for the
same period in 2015. Military segment sales for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $26.5 million, compared to $12.2
million in the same period in 2015. In early 2013, we received an order to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce
 Hot Weather  combat boots. Shipments to the U.S. Military for both periods were made under this order. In early 2016,
we received an order to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce  Temperate Weather  combat boots. We began
shipping under this order in March 2016. 

Gross margin.  Gross margin for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $54.9 million, or 28.4% of net sales, compared to $66.7 million, or 32.7% of net sales, in the same
period last year. Wholesale gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $39.6 million, or 29.4% of net
sales, compared to $50.7 million, or 31.7% of net sales, in the same period last year. The 230 basis point decrease was
primarily due to higher manufacturing costs associated with the ramp up of production at our manufacturing facility in Puerto
Rico, primarily in the second and third quarter of 2016. The Retail gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $14.3 million, or 44.4% of net sales, compared to $14.5 million, or 44.8% of net sales, for the same period in 2015.
Military gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million, or 3.9% of net sales, compared to $1.6
million, or 13.3% of net sales, for the same period in 2015. The decrease in margin was due to higher manufacturing costs
associated with the ramp up of production at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico, primarily in the second quarter of
2016. 

SG A expenses.  SG A expenses were $55.7 million,
or 28.8% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $58.2 million, or 28.5% of net sales for the
same period in 2015. The $2.5 million decrease is primarily related to lower advertising expense of $0.8 million, lower freight
and handling expenses of $0.9 million, and lower commission expense of $0.5 million. 

Reorganizational Charge.  During the quarter ended September
30, 2016, we recorded $1.2 million in a reorganizational charge consisting of severance. The purpose of this reorganization was
to maximize profitability, drive long-term revenue growth and maximize shareholder value. 

Interest expense.  Interest expense was $0.5 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income taxes.  Income tax benefit for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $0.8 million, compared to $2.7 million expense for the same period a year ago. We provided for income taxes
at effective tax rates of 34.0% for 2016 and 34.2% for 2015.  In the third
quarter of 2016 and 2015, we reduced our estimated effective tax rate for the full year for the expected permanent capital investment
in the Dominican Republic which reduces the amount of dividends that we need to provide for U.S. income taxes.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our principal sources of liquidity have been our income from operations
and borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility. 

Over the last several years our principal uses of cash have been
for working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth. Our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables
and inventory, offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result
of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of January through March of each year
and highest during the months of May through October of each year. We typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund
our seasonal working capital requirements. As a result, balances on our revolving credit facility will fluctuate significantly
throughout the year. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our property, merchandising fixtures, molds
and equipment associated with our manufacturing and distribution operations and for information technology. Capital expenditures
were $5.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2015. Total capital expenditures
for 2016 are anticipated to be approximately $6.9 million. 

In October 2010, we entered into a financing
agreement with PNC Bank ( PNC ) to provide a $70 million credit facility. In December 2014, we amended and restated
the credit facility to increase the facility to $75 million and extend the term of the facility an additional five years. The
credit facility s base interest rate is the current prime rate less 0.25%, however the credit facility provides us the option
to borrow on up to eight fixed loans at LIBOR plus 1.25% in accordance with the 2014 amended and restated credit agreement. The
LIBOR rate is determined based on the fixed loan maturities, which vary from 30, 60, 90, or 180 days. As of September 30, 2016,
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, we had approximately $23.0 million, $17.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively, in
fixed LIBOR borrowings under the credit facility. The amended and restated credit facility matures in November 2019. 

The total amount available under our amended
and restated revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable
and inventory. As of September 30, 2016, we had $31.0 million in borrowings under this facility and total capacity of $70.0 million. 

Our amended and restated credit
facility contains a restrictive covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. This restrictive covenant
is only in effect upon a triggering event taking place (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement). At
September 30, 2016, there was no triggering event and the covenant was not in effect. 

We have no other long-term debt maturities. 

Operating Activities.  Cash provided by (used in) operating
activities totaled $2.5 million and $(1.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided
by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily impacted by increases in accounts payable and
other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Cash used in   operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily impacted by increases in accounts receivable and inventory. 

Investing Activities.  Cash used in investing activities
was $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.5 million in the same period of 2015. Cash used
in investing activities reflects an investment in property, plant and equipment of $5.2 million in 2016 and $5.5 million in 2015.
Our 2016 and 2015 expenditures primarily relate to investments in molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations,
for information technology and for improvements to our distribution facility. 

Financing Activities.  Cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.1 million and was primarily related to net
borrowing proceeds of $7.3 million from our revolving credit facility, partially offset by payments of $2.5 million of dividends
on common stock and repurchases of common
stock of $1.6 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $6.3 million and
was primarily related to net borrowing proceeds of $8.8 million from our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the payment of $2.4 million of dividends on common stock. 

Inflation  

We cannot determine the precise effects of inflation; however,
inflation continues to have an influence on the cost of materials, salaries, and employee benefits. We attempt to offset the effects
of inflation through increased selling prices, productivity improvements, and reduction of costs. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  discusses our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
interim condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A summary of our significant
accounting policies is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Our management regularly reviews our accounting policies to make
certain they are current and also to provide readers of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements with useful and
reliable information about our operating results and financial condition. These include, but are not limited to, matters related
to accounts receivable, inventories, intangibles and income taxes. Implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates
and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable. This may include judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our management believes the following critical accounting policies
are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require more significant judgments
and estimates in the preparation of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue recognition  

Revenue principally consists of sales to customers, and, to a lesser
extent, license fees. Revenue is recognized when the risk and title passes to the customer, while license fees are recognized
when earned. Customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns, trade promotions and other discounts, which
are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale. 

Accounts receivable allowances  

Management maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The
allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on the relative age and size of trade receivable balances. 

Sales returns and allowances  

We record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer
returns and allowances. These reductions are influenced by historical experience, based on actual customer returns and allowances.
The actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from our estimates. If we determine that sales returns or
allowances should be either increased or decreased, then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such
a determination is made. 

Inventories  

Management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates
appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the
vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable, and we have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories
through our factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers. Should management encounter difficulties liquidating
slow moving or obsolete inventories, additional provisions may be necessary. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of our
inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required. 

Intangible assets  

Intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks and patents are
reviewed for impairment annually, and more frequently, if necessary. We perform such testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. 

In assessing whether indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired,
we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating
margins, weighted average cost of capital and other factors such as discount rates, royalty rates, cost of capital, and market
multiples to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management s judgment, and
changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for each
of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Future events could cause us to conclude that indications of intangible asset
impairment exist. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market
conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting segment.
Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Income taxes  

Management has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred
tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net operating losses that it believes may not be realized. We have considered
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance;
however, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in
the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.   

Except for the historical information
contained herein, the matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  include certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Those statements include, but may not
be limited to, all statements regarding our and management s intent, belief, and expectations, such as statements concerning
our future profitability and our operating and growth strategy. Words such as  believe,   anticipate, 
 expect,   will,   may,   should,   intend,   plan,   estimate, 
 predict,   potential,   continue,   likely  and similar expressions are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and in other statements we make involve risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, the factors
set forth under the caption  Risk Factors  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, and other factors detailed from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One or
more of these factors have affected, and in the future could affect our businesses and financial results and could cause actual
results to differ materially from plans and projections. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any of the forward-looking statements included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person
that our objectives and plans will be achieved. All forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
based on information presently available to our management. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

There have been no material changes since December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Disclosure controls
and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management,
with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were (1) designed
to ensure that material information relating to our Company is accumulated and made known to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, in a timely manner, particularly during the period in which this report was being
prepared, and (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Management believes, however, that a controls system, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
detected. 

Internal Controls . There has been no
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
