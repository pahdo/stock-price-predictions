     Table of Contents          MED SPA VACATIONS INC.     Notes to the Unaudited Financial Statements     For the period ended September 30, 2016       NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Med Spa Vacations Inc., (the  Company ) is a Nevada corporation incorporated on October 5, 2015. It is based in La Jolla, California. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company s fiscal year end is December 31.     Med Spa Vacations plans to develop a business that specializes in marketing health and wellness vacations to both individuals and corporate groups that are looking to revitalize and develop a fuller day-to-day life. The Company is looking to establish a niche in the travel market that caters to sustained wellness and rejuvenation, recognizing the ever-increasing social trend toward finding of a more holistic balance in life.      To date, the Company s activities have been limited to the sourcing of its advertising channels, initial branding efforts, and in its formation and the raising of equity capital.       NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation of Unaudited Interim Financial Statements       The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included for the period ended December 31, 2015.       Restricted Cash       The Company is required to restrict a portion of cash, per the terms of our merchant account agreement, for potential credit card chargebacks. We are subject to a cash reserve of up to 10% on credit card charges processed, with funds held for seven to twelve months depending on our account activity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $54 in restricted cash.      NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN       The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a loss from operations of $15,584, an accumulated deficit of $17,579 and has earned no revenues. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the period ending September 30, 2016.     The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.     These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.                 F-7

General Overview      We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 5, 2015. Our plan is to develop a business that specializes in marketing health and wellness vacations to both individuals and corporate groups looking to revitalize and develop a fuller day-to-day life. We are looking to establish a niche in the travel market that caters to sustained wellness and rejuvenation, recognizing the ever-increasing social trend toward finding of a more holistic balance in life.

We are looking to establish a niche in the travel market that caters to sustained wellness and rejuvenation, recognizing the ever-increasing social trend toward finding of a more holistic balance in life.

     Table of Contents           Emerging Growth Company      We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:            1.  The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;               2.  The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;               3.  The date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or               4.  The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer', as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.           As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.     As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.     We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.        Results of Operations      We have not earned any revenues from our inception on October 5, 2015 through September 30, 2016.      Three and Nine months ended September 30, 2016.                         9       
     Table of Contents         Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consist of the following:           General and administrative expenses consist of general office costs, marketing and other miscellaneous expenses. Professional fees are legal and accounting fees generally related to our recent filing of a registration statement on Form S-1.         Liquidity and Capital Resources      The following table provides selected financial data about our company as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.      Working Capital            Current assets are comprised mostly of our cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.       Cash Flows                        Nine months ended  September 30, 2016           Cash used in operating activities        $  (10,809  )     Cash used in investing activities        $  -          Cash provided by financing activities        $  -          Net Decrease In Cash During Period        $  (10,809  )        We had cash and cash equivalents of $7,196 as of September 30, 2016 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $18,005 as of December 31, 2015. We had working capital of $2,421 as of September 30, 2016 compared to working capital of $18,005 as of December 31, 2015.            The report of our auditors on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contains a going concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception. We have minimal assets and have achieved no operating revenues since our inception. We have been dependent on sales of equity securities to conduct operations. Unless and until we commence material operations and achieve material revenues, we will remain dependent on financings to continue our operations.      Operating Activities      Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,809. We incurred a net loss of $15,584 which was reduced by a net change in working capital of $4,775.       Investing Activities      We did not have cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Financing Activities      We did not have cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Cash Requirements      We will require additional cash as we expand our business. Our plans to compete in the wellness vacation business will require us to accelerate our pay per click (PPC) marketing program. Initially, to carry out these plans we will need to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or, if we are able to raise additional capital, the terms will be acceptable to us.     These conditions indicate a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We require additional debt or equity financing to have the necessary funding to continue operations and meet our obligations. We have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing our financial statements.      We estimate that we will require approximately $20,000, or approximately $1,667 per month, to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months.         Future Financings      We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.     Other than the sale of up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock currently being offered by a prospectus dated October 6, 2016, we presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.             Critical Accounting Policies        Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures      As of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.     The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.     Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.     C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we area party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us.         Item 1A. Risk Factors       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 2.
