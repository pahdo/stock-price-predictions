1.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures considered necessary for the fair presentation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been included.  Interim results are not necessarily reflective of the results of the entire year. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and notes thereto included in the Company s prospectus, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on May 18, 2016. 

The unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, Legion Parkway Company LLC, a security corporation formed on July 13, 2016, HarborOne Bank (the  Bank ) and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The Bank s subsidiaries consist of a mortgage company and two security corporations.  Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC ( Merrimack Mortgage ) was acquired and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank on July 1, 2015.  The security corporations were established for the purpose of buying, holding and selling securities on their own behalf.  The Company established Legion Parkway Company LLC for the same purpose.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Stock Conversion 

On June 29, 2016, the Bank reorganized into a two-tier mutual holding company structure with a mid-tier stock holding company. The Company sold 14,454,396 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, including 1,187,188 shares purchased by the Company s Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ). In addition, the Company issued 17,281,034 shares to HarborOne Mutual Bancshares, the Company s mutual holding company parent (the  MHC ) and 385,450 shares to The HarborOne Foundation ( Foundation ),     a charitable foundation that was formed in connection with the stock offering and is dedicated to supporting charitable organizations operating in the Bank s local community. A total of 32,120,880 shares of common stock were outstanding following the completion of the stock offering.  

The direct costs of the Company s stock offering of $3,870,000 were deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the offering.   

Upon the completion of the stock offering, a special  liquidation account  was established for the benefit of certain depositors of the Bank in an amount equal to the percentage ownership interest in the equity of the Company held by persons other than the MHC as of the date of the latest balance sheet contained in the prospectus. The Company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if the Company s shareholders  equity would be reduced below the amount of the liquidation account. The liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible account holders have reduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases in an eligible account holder s qualifying deposits will not restore such holder s interest in the liquidation account. 

Nature of Operations 

The Bank, originally established in 1917 as a state-chartered credit union, converted to a state-chartered co-operative bank on July 1, 2013.  The Bank provides a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses through its fourteen full-service and two limited-service bank offices in eastern Massachusetts, a commercial lending office in Providence, Rhode Island, and a residential loan office in Westford, Massachusetts.  Merrimack Mortgage maintains 33 offices in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, and is also licensed to lend in seven additional states.

The Company s primary deposit products are checking, money market, savings and term certificate of deposit accounts while its primary lending products are commercial real estate, commercial, residential mortgages and consumer loans, including indirect automobile lending. The Company also originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans primarily through Merrimack Mortgage. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuations of mortgage servicing rights, derivatives, goodwill and deferred tax assets.   

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed and generally do not exceed the time frame provided in The Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 

The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management.  This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  The allowance consists of general, allocated and unallocated components, as further described below. 

General component 

The general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by the Company s loan segments.  Management uses a     rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment.  Adjustments to this historical loss factor are considered for the following qualitative factors: levels/trends in delinquencies; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience/ability/depth of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends and conditions.  There were no changes in the Company s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during 2015 or the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment.  Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows: 

Residential real estate   The Company generally does not originate portfolio loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 percent without obtaining private mortgage insurance and does not generally grant loans that would be classified as subprime upon origination.  The Company generally has first or second liens on property securing equity lines of credit.  Loans in this segment are generally collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.  The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, can have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.    

Commercial real estate   Loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties in southeastern New England.  The underlying cash flows generated by the properties can be adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates, which in turn, could have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.  Management obtains rent rolls annually and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Construction   Loans in this segment include both residential and commercial construction loans.  Residential construction loans include loans to build one- to four-family owner-occupied properties, which are subject to the same credit quality factors as residential real estate loans.  Commercial construction loans may include speculative real estate development loans for which payment is derived from lease or sale of the property.  Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, time to lease or sell at an adequate price, and market conditions. 

Commercial   Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business.  Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business.  A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer or business spending, could have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.    

Consumer   Loans in this segment are generally secured by automobiles or unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. 

Allocated component 

The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired.  Residential real estate, commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis.  Impairment is determined by nonaccrual status, whether a loan is subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement or in the case of certain loans, based on the internal credit rating.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.  Accordingly, except for troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ), the Company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment evaluation.   

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.   

The Company periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans.  When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a TDR.  All TDRs are initially classified as impaired.  Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 

Unallocated component 

An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses.  The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

Compensation expense for the Company s ESOP is recorded at an amount equal to the shares allocated by the ESOP multiplied by the average fair market value of the shares during the year.  The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the year based upon the Company s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the ESOP.  The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

As an  emerging growth company  as defined in Title 1 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.  As of September 30, 2016, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)  , which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates.  The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity s portfolio.  For public entities that are SEC filers, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  For public entities that are not SEC filers, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020.  For non-public entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.  Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This update makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  For non-public business, entities this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)  .  This update requires a lessee to record a right-to-use asset and a liability representing the obligation to make lease payments for long-term leases.  For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  For non-public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall, (Subtopic 825-10).    The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  Targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles include the requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, the elimination of the requirement for non-public business entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost and the elimination of the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  For non-public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . The amendments in this update create Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , and supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve the core principle, a company should apply a five step approach to revenue recognition. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. For non-public business entities, this ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application is permitted, but only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity at September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

U.S. government-sponsored residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and securities whose underlying assets are loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA asset-backed securities ) have stated maturities of six to 27 years; however, it is expected that such securities will have shorter actual lives due to prepayments. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no sales of securities available for sale.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale amounted to $27,363,000 and gross realized gains amounted to $1,000.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale amounted to $8,735,000 and $30,730,000, respectively, and gross realized gains amounted to $242,000 and $187,000, respectively.  There were no securities called for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gains of $41,000 and $108,000, respectively, were recognized on securities called with an amortized cost of $15,725,000 and $5,000,000, respectively.

Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position follows: 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting period, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. 

At September 30, 2016, five debt securities with an amortized cost of $16,208,000 have unrealized losses with aggregate depreciation of 1.14% from the Company s amortized cost basis.   

The unrealized losses on the Company s securities were primarily caused by changes in interest rates.  All of these investments are guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises.  Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value of the investment.  Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not to credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.

3.  LOANS    

A summary of the balances of loans follows:  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold indirect auto loans of $10,010,000, and recognized gains of $79,000. No indirect auto loans were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $31,337,000 of indirect loans were sold and recognized gains of $136,000.  The unpaid principal balance of indirect auto loans serviced for others was $35,844,000 and $40,370,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

The Company sold residential portfolio loans of $29,456,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Included in mortgage banking income is gain on sale of $501,000.  No residential loans were sold from the portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company has transferred a portion of its originated commercial real estate loans to participating lenders.  The amounts transferred have been accounted for as sales and are therefore not included in the Company s accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company and participating lenders share ratably in cash flows and any gains or losses that may result from a borrower s lack of compliance with contractual terms of the loan.  The Company continues to service the loans on behalf of the participating lenders and, as such, collects cash payments from the borrowers, remits payments to participating lenders and disburses required escrow funds to relevant parties.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was servicing loans for participants aggregating $32,877,000 and $11,854,000, respectively.

There were no TDRs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The recorded investment of troubled debt restructurings was $31,776,000 and $35,312,000 at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Of these loans, $6,753,000 and $9,804,000 were nonaccruing at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Although not general practice, there were modifications that included extending maturity dates.  These amounts show an increase from the pre-modification balance due to capitalized delinquent interest and/or escrow.  All TDR loans are considered impaired and management performs a discounted cash flow calculation to determine the amount of impairment reserve required on each loan.  TDR loans which subsequently default are reviewed to determine if the loan should be deemed collateral dependent.  In either case, any reserve required is recorded as part of the allowance for loan losses. 

The following tables pertain to trouble debt restructures that defaulted in the first twelve months after restructure.  A default is defined as two or more payments in arrears.  

Mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure totaled $4,416,000 and $6,546,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are reported in loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Credit Quality Information 

The Company uses a ten grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, commercial construction and commercial loans, as follows: 

Loans rated 1   6 are considered  pass  rated loans with low to average risk. 

Loans rated 7 are considered  special mention.   These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management.   

Loans rated 8 are considered  substandard.   Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged.  There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected. 

19 

Table of Contents  

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Loans rated 9 are considered  doubtful.   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loans rated 10 are considered  uncollectible  (loss), and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted.   

Loans not rated consist primarily of residential construction loans and certain smaller balance commercial real estate and commercial loans that are managed by exception.   

On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans.  Annually, the Company engages an independent third party to review a significant portion of loans within these segments.  Management uses the results of these reviews as part of its annual review process.   

On a monthly basis, the Company reviews the residential construction, residential real estate and consumer installment portfolios for credit quality primarily through the use of delinquency reports. 

The following table presents the Company s loans by risk rating at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

4.  MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING   

The Company sells residential mortgages to government-sponsored entities and other parties.  The Company retains no beneficial interests in these loans, but may retain the servicing rights of the loans sold.  Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The risks inherent in mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) relate primarily to changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates.  The unpaid principal balances of mortgage loans serviced for others were $1.64 billion and $1.24 billion as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company elected to account for MSRs at fair value.  The Company obtains valuations from independent third parties to determine the fair value of MSRs.  Key assumptions used in the estimation of fair value include prepayment speeds, discount rates, default rates, cost to service, and contractual servicing fees.  At September 30, 2016 and December 2015, the following weighted average assumptions were used in the calculation of fair value of MSRs:

The following summarizes changes to mortgage servicing rights for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, contractually specified servicing fees included in other mortgage banking income amounted to $1,110,000 and $662,000, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, contractually specified servicing fees included in other mortgage banking income amounted to $2,869,000 and $1,312,000, respectively.

6.  BORROWED FUNDS    

Borrowed funds at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of FHLB advances and are summarized by maturity and call date below: 

The FHLB advances are secured by a blanket security agreement on qualified collateral defined primarily as 79% of the carrying value of first mortgage loans on residential property and 94% of the fair value of government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities obligations.   

The Company also has an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank secured by 72% of the carrying value of indirect auto loans with an amortized balance amounting to $225,091,000 and $288,016,000, respectively, of which no amount was outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

7.  INCOME TAXES   

Income Tax Provision 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an expense of $1,900,000 and $1,213,000, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 34.83% and 28.82%, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the tax provision expense was $1,165,000 and $1,699,000, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 34.18% and 28.68%, respectively.  The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 is due primarily to the effect of higher projected pre-tax income while maintaining the same level of tax-advantaged income, such as bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. 

Deferred Tax Liability 

At September 30, 2016, the Company reported a net deferred tax liability of $696,000, compared to a $989,000 liability as of December 31, 2015. The contribution to the charitable foundation in June 2016 created a deferred tax asset of $1,507,000.  Increases in offsetting components of deferred tax include a $2,032,000 liability for derivatives and $750,000 for allowance for loan losses.

8.  OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Loan Commitments  

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and advance funds on various lines of credit.  Those commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 

The following off-balance sheet financial instruments were outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The contract amounts represent credit risk. 

Commitments to extend credit and unadvanced portion of construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments to grant loans generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  The commitments for unadvanced funds on construction loans, home equity and revolving lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  Commitments to grant loans, and unadvanced construction loans and home equity lines of credit are collateralized by real estate, while revolving lines of credit are unsecured. 

9.  DERIVATIVES   

Interest Rate Risk Management   Derivative Instruments Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 

The Company is party to a variety of derivative transactions, including derivative loan commitments, forward loan sale commitments and interest rate swap contracts. The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. The Company also enters into derivative contracts as a means of reducing its interest rate risk and market risk.   

All derivatives are recognized in the unaudited interim Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings.  The Company did not have any fair value hedges or cash flow hedges at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

Derivative Loan Commitments 

Mortgage loan commitments qualify as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held for sale upon funding.  The Company enters into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified times in the future, with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market.  A mortgage loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock.  

23 

Table of Contents  

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose the Company to the risk that the price of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitment might decline from inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates.  If interest rates increase, the value of these loan commitments decreases.  Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increases.   

Forward Loan Sale Commitments 

The Company utilizes both  mandatory delivery  and  best efforts  forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loans that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments.   

With a  mandatory delivery  contract, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date.  If the Company fails to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, it is obligated to pay a  pair-off  fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall.  

With a  best efforts  contract, the Company commits to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes.  Generally, the price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded (e.g., on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower). 

The Company expects that these forward loan sale commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of derivative loan commitments.   

Interest Rate Swaps 

The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements that are transacted to meet the financing needs of its commercial customers. Offsetting interest rate swap agreements are simultaneously transacted with a third-party financial institution to effectively eliminate the Company s interest rate risk associated with the customer swaps. The primary risks associated with these transactions arise from exposure to the ability of the counterparties to meet the terms of the contract.  Mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $7,316,000 are pledged to secure the Company s liability for the offsetting interest rate swaps.  The interest rate swap notional amount below is the aggregate notional amount of the customer swap and the offsetting third-party swap.

The following table presents information pertaining to the Company s derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of net income: 

10.  COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS    

Supplemental Retirement Plans 

On March 1, 2016, in anticipation of the reorganization, the Company amended a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan with an executive to accelerate vesting.  This amendment increased the net present value of the benefit obligation in the amount of $891,000 and this increase was expensed in the first quarter of 2016.   

Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

On June 29, 2016, the Company established an ESOP to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Company stock. The plan is a tax-qualified retirement plan for the benefit of the Company employees.  Contributions are allocated to eligible participants on the basis of compensation, subject to federal tax limits.  The number of shares committed to be released per year is 59,359 through 2035.   

As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,157,508 unallocated shares held by the ESOP and 29,680 committed to be allocated.  The fair value of unallocated shares was approximately $18,242,000 at September 30, 2016.  Total compensation expense recognized in connection with the ESOP was $409,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. 

11.  MINIMUM REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS   

The Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ).  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing Tier 1 and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets.  Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several risk-weight categories, based primarily on relative risk.  The rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a leverage ratio of 4.0%.  Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, the capital rules require a bank holding company to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements equal to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. 

Under rules effective January 1, 2015, a bank holding company, such as the Company, is considered  well capitalized  if the bank holding company (i) has a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and (iii) is not subject to any written agreement order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

The FDIC has amended its prompt corrective action rules to reflect the revisions made by the revised capital rules described above.  Under the FDIC s revised rules, which became effective January 1, 2015, an insured state nonmember bank is considered  well capitalized  if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  In addition, because the Bank obtained FDIC deposit insurance in 2013, it was treated as a   de novo   institution and was required by the FDIC to maintain a leverage ratio of not less than 8.0% for the first seven years of operation following the effectiveness of its deposit insurance.  The Bank received notification from the FDIC that its status as a newly insured institution and the applicability of these enhanced regulatory requirements terminated on July 1, 2016. 

The Company s regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2016 and the Bank s regulatory capital ratios as of September 3016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the table below.

12.      COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)   

Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income.  Although certain changes in assets and liabilities are reported as a separate component of the retained earnings section of the balance sheets, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income (loss). 

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), included in retained earnings, are as follows:

13.  FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES   

Determination of Fair Value 

The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices.  However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various assets or liabilities.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability.   

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures: 

Cash and cash equivalents   - The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values based on the short-term nature of the assets. 

Securities   - All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management.  Securities measured at fair value in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in an active exchange market.  Securities measured at fair value in Level 2 are based on pricing models that consider standard input factors such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, credit spreads and new issue data.   

Federal Home Loan Bank stock   - The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock is equal to cost based on redemption provisions. 

Mortgage loans held for sale   - Fair values are based on prevailing market prices for similar commitments.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no mortgage loans held for sale that were greater than ninety days past due.   

The following table provides the fair value and contractual principal balance outstanding of mortgage loans held for sale accounted for under the fair value option: 

Loans   - Fair values for mortgage loans and other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  Fair values for non-performing loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or underlying collateral values, where applicable. 

Retirement plan annuities   - The carrying value of the annuities are based on their contract values which approximate fair value. 

Mortgage servicing rights   - Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. 

29 

Table of Contents  

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Deposits and mortgagors  escrow accounts   - The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) and mortgagors  escrow accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).  Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. 

Borrowed funds   - The fair values of borrowed funds are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current incremental borrowing rates in the market for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  

Accrued interest   - The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. 

Forward loan sale commitments and derivative loan commitments   - Forward loan sale commitments and derivative loan commitments are based on fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised.  The assumptions for pull-through rates are derived from internal data and adjusted using management judgment. Derivative loan commitments include the non-refundable costs of originating the loan based on the Company s internal cost analysis that is not observable.   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average pull-through rate for derivative loan commitments was 83% and 85%, respectively.  

Interest rate swaps   - The Company s interest rate swaps are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available.  For these interest rate derivatives, fair value is determined by a third party utilizing models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as swap rates and yield curves.  The pricing models used to value interest rate swaps calculate the sum of each instrument s fixed and variable cash flows, which are then discounted using an appropriate yield curve to arrive at the fair value of each swap.  The pricing models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the methodologies used do not require significant judgment. 

Off-balance sheet credit-related instruments   - Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  The fair value of off-balance sheet instruments are immaterial. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. 

Level 1   Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2   Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3   Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.   

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period, if applicable.  There were no transfers during the periods presented.

The table below presents, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 

The Company may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.  There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related individual assets.   

Losses in the following table represent the amount of the fair value adjustments recorded during the period on the carrying value of the assets held at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Losses applicable to write-downs of impaired loans and other real estate owned and repossessed assets are based on the appraised value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell.  The losses on impaired loans is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings, but rather as a component in determining the allowance for loan losses.  The losses on other real estate owned and repossessed assets represent adjustments in valuation recorded during the time period indicated and not for losses incurred on sales.  Appraised values are typically based on a blend of (a) an income approach using observable cash flows to measure fair value, and (b) a market approach using observable market comparables.  These appraised values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge, expertise or changes in market conditions from time of valuation.  

Summary of Fair Values of Financial Instruments  

The estimated fair values, and related carrying or notional amounts, of the Company s financial instruments are as follows.  Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are exempt from disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented herein may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company.

14.  EARNINGS PER SHARE   ( EPS ) 

Basic EPS represents net income attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.  Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for EPS calculations.  There were no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Certain of our accounting policies, which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.  Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances.  Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.   

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies described in the Company s prospectus, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) on May 18, 2016.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 

Total Assets.      Total assets increased $184.0 million, or 8.51%, to $2.35 billion at September 30, 2016 from $2.16 billion at December 31, 2015 as we continued our commercial loan growth strategy.  Additionally, on June 29, 2016, the Company completed a mutual to stock conversion.  Net proceeds from the initial public offering ( IPO ) were $140.5 million. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents.      Cash and cash equivalents decreased $21.4 million to $19.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $40.7 million at December 31, 2015, as excess cash and increased deposits were redeployed into commercial loans.  

Loans Held for Sale.      Loans held for sale at September 30, 2016 were $114.1 million, an increase of $50.3 million from $63.8 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to ongoing mortgage refinance and origination activity. Of the loans held for sale at September 30, 2016, $102.6 million were originated by Merrimack Mortgage and $11.5 million were originated by the Bank.  

Loans, net.      At September 30, 2016, net loans were $1.90 billion, an increase of $175.5 million, or 10.15%, from $1.73 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the Bank s commercial real estate, construction and auto loan originations, partially offset by a decrease in residential first and second mortgage loans. Total commercial real estate and commercial loans at September 30, 2016 were $539.7 million, an increase of $203.7 million, or 60.64%, from $336.0 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting the execution of our business strategy to increase commercial lending. Consumer loans increased $6.9 million, or 1.26%, including the sale of $10.0 million of indirect auto loans. Construction loans increased $4.6 million, or 12.86%, in the same period, primarily due to commercial construction loan originations. Our residential portfolio decreased by $35.9 million, or 4.44%, for the same period primarily due to sales of $29.4 million, with servicing retained by the Company. The allowance for loan losses was $15.8 million at September 30, 2016 and $13.7 million December 31, 2015. 

The following table provides the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated:

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Securities.      Total investment securities at September 30, 2016 were $164.6 million, a decrease of $27.5 million, or 14.32%, from December 31, 2015. The sale of $8.5 million of securities as well as $35.0 million in prepayments, calls and amortization were only partially offset by $14.2 million in securities purchases. The decline in investments reflects our continued strategy to change the composition of our balance sheet to higher yielding loans.  The following table provides the composition of our securities available for sale and our securities held to maturity at the dates indicated: 

Mortgage servicing rights.      Mortgage servicing rights are created as a result of our mortgage banking origination activities and accounted for at fair value. At September 30, 2016, we serviced mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.64 billion. Total mortgage servicing rights were $15.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $13.0 million at December 31, 2015. The $2.6 million increase was primarily due to new loan servicing rights added to the portfolio partially offset by a combination of changes in market interest rates and loan repayments. 

The following table represents the activity for mortgage servicing rights and the related fair value changes during the periods noted:

Table of Contents  

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights is determined by a third party provider that determines the appropriate prepayment speed, discount and default rate assumptions based on our portfolio. Any measurement of fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made at a particular point in time. Those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different point in time. The following table presents weighted average assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Prepayment speeds are significantly impacted by mortgage rates. Decreasing mortgage rates normally encourage increased mortgage refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the mortgage servicing rights, thereby reducing the value of mortgage servicing rights.  

Management has made the strategic decision not to hedge mortgage servicing assets at this point. Therefore, any future declines in interest rates would likely cause further decreases in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, and a corresponding detriment to earnings, whereas increases in interest rates would result in increases in fair value, and a corresponding benefit to earnings. Management may choose to hedge the mortgage servicing assets in the future or limit the balance of mortgage servicing rights by selling them or selling loans with the servicing released.  

Deposits.      Deposits increased $43.7 million, or 2.58%, to $1.73 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.69 billion at December 31, 2015. The growth in deposits was driven by an increase of $37.9 million in checking account deposits, $21.7 million in savings account deposits and $116,000 in certificates of deposits partially offset by a decline of $16.0 million in money market deposits that includes an increase in consumer accounts of $46.4 million offset by a decrease of $59.1 million in municipal funds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to focus on enhancing our deposit mix in order to better manage our cost of funds and to expand our customer relationships.  Additionally, we established brokered certificates of deposit to provide another avenue of funding. 

Borrowings.   Total borrowings from the FHLB were $245.1 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $4.5 million from $249.6 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease reflects $74.5 million in prepayment of FHLB borrowings at a weighted average cost of 1.57% for a prepayment penalty of $400,000 that occurred in the second quarter to ensure compliance with the   de novo   capital requirement of 8.0%. The decrease was partially offset by a first quarter five-year term $20.0 million FHLB borrowing to fund commercial loan growth and $50 million of short term borrowing. 

Stockholders  equity  .     Total stockholders  equity was $327.9 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $190.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increases from the prior period reflect the Company s mutual to stock conversion that was completed on June 29, 2016.  As part of the conversion, the Company established an ESOP which acquired 8% of the shares issued in the conversion, including shares contributed to the Foundation. The $11.6 million related to the ESOP is shown as a reduction to stockholders  equity on the consolidated balance sheets.  

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Overview  .     Consolidated net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, compared to net income of $2.2 million and $4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The year to date 2016 results include a one-time, pre-tax contribution of $4.8 million to establish the Foundation.  Excluding this non-recurring expense, net income would have been $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Average Balances and Yields.   The following tables set forth average balance sheets, annualized average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. Interest income on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis using a federal tax rate of 35%.  All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis.   The following table presents, on a tax equivalent basis, the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. 

Interest and Dividend Income.      Interest and dividend income increased $1.5 million, or 8.32%, to $19.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million, or 10.54%, increase in interest on loans and loans held for sale to $18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $16.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in loan interest income was attributable to an 8.29% increase in average loans outstanding as well as the shift in mix to higher yielding commercial loans, which resulted in an increase in average yield of 8 basis points. Interest and dividend income on securities decreased by $242,000, or 19.67%, from $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $988,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a 21.84% decrease in average investments outstanding offset by an 18 basis point improvement in the yield compared to same period in 2015.

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, interest and dividend income increased $5.4 million, or 10.83%, primarily reflecting the repositioning of the balance sheet to higher yielding commercial loans. Loan income increased $5.7 million to $51.0 million and average loans increased by $160.3 million from a year ago. 

Interest Expense.      Interest expense decreased $543,000, or 14.28%, to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted from a $415,000 decrease in interest expense on borrowings and a $128,000 decrease in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in interest expense on borrowings reflects the lower average borrowings outstanding by $80.9 million, or 25.80%, when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in interest expense on deposits resulted from a 0.48% decrease in average balances and a 3 basis point decrease in the cost of deposits. The cost of certificates of deposit declined 1 basis point to 1.14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the average balance decreased 10.50%. Average money market deposits increased by $4.3 million, or 0.71%. The cost of money market deposits was 44 basis points for the September 30, 2016 and 2015 quarterly periods. The cost of savings accounts remained the same at 17 basis points in the 2016 period as in the 2015 period and the average balance increased 10.56%. The cost of NOW accounts was 6 basis points and the average balance increased 8.18% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $757,000, or 6.87% to $10.3 million from $11.0 million. The decrease reflects a decrease in average FHLB borrowing of 20.75%, partially offset by average deposit growth of 5.41% that was tempered by a 3 basis point decrease in cost of deposit funds. Average FHLB borrowings decreased due to the prepayment of FHLB borrowings in the second quarter of 2016.     

Net Interest and Dividend Income.      Net interest and dividend income increased $2.0 million, or 14.51%, to $15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Growth in higher yielding commercial loans was primarily funded with deposit growth and capital provided by the IPO. The tax equivalent net interest spread increased 22 basis points to 2.78% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.56 % for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis also rose by 26 basis points to 2.93% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.67% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, net interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $6.1 million, or 15.92%, to $44.4 million from $38.3 million. The tax equivalent net interest spread increased 23 basis points to 2.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.46 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis also rose by 25 basis points to 2.82% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.57% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

HarborOne Bank Segment 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net Income.      Bank net income increased by $294,000 to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and, pre-tax income was $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a $396,000 increase from the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in pre-tax income reflects a $2.0 million increase in net interest income and a $1.2 million increase in noninterest income partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in noninterest expense and a $1.4 million increase in the provision for loan losses.  The provision for income taxes increased $102,000 offsetting the pre-tax income increase for the quarter.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, Bank net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $131,000 to $3.3 million from $3.4 million.  The decrease in net income reflects an increase of $5.5 million of noninterest expense and an increase of $1.5 million in provision for loan losses partially offset by increases of $1.8 million in net interest income and $632,000 in noninterest income. 

Provision for Loan Losses.      We recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.7 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $325,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in provision reflects the continued growth in commercial loans shifting the composition of the loan portfolio to a higher percentage of commercial lending, which requires a higher level of loan loss reserves than loans secured by automobiles and residential property.  The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the level of net charge-offs to $317,000 and $584,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $440,000 and $1.2 million for the same periods in 2015. Additionally, credit quality improved as nonaccrual loans declined to $24.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $30.2 million at September 30, 2015. 

Noninterest Income.      Total noninterest income increased to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and compared to $4.3 million for the prior year period. Income from mortgage banking operations increased $967,000, or 218.3%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $443,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily a result of the increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights of $155,000 in 2016 compared to a decline of $315,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, driven by the market rates changes during the period. Additionally, other mortgage banking income increased of $497,000 or 65.6%, from the third quarter 2015 reflecting an increase of $229,000 from gains on loan sales and a $197,000 increase related to fair value mark increases on loans held for sale and loan derivatives.   

Other noninterest income increased $205,000, or 5.3%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was driven by an increase in commercial loan swap fee income of $120,000, and a $122,000 increase in debit card interchange income. Gain on sales of investment securities was $1,000 and gain on consumer loan sales was $136,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, while no such sales were undertaken in the current year period. 

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, total noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.8 million, or 14.1%, to $14.6 million from $12.8 million. Total mortgage banking income increased $814,000 as other mortgage banking income increased $1.4 million partially offset by the increase in fair value loss on the mortgage servicing rights of $573,000 as the low rate environment of the first half of 2016 negatively impacted servicing rights values and positively impacted mortgage loan origination volumes.  Other noninterest income increased $990,000 or 8.7%, to $12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The components of the increase include $374,000 related to the income recognized on commercial loan swaps and deposit fee income increased $425,000, primarily due to increased debit card interchange income.    

Noninterest Expense.      Noninterest expense increased $1.4 million, or 9.1%, to $16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in noninterest expense included increased salaries and benefit costs of $1.5 million, as the Bank continued its hiring of additional commercial lending and credit support staff during 2016 and recorded $515,000 of ESOP expense. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $218,000 and loan expenses increased $240,000. The increases were partially offset by a $418,000 decrease in expenses related to strategic initiatives.  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015 the Bank recognized $355,000 in prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings of $25.0 million. 

Compared to the first nine months of 2015, noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $5.5 million, or 12.3% to $50.2 million from $44.7 million.  The year-to-date increase primarily reflects increased salaries and benefit costs of $5.3 million, as the Bank continued its hiring of additional commercial lending and credit support staff during 2016.

Income Tax Provision.      Provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $739,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, compared to $637,000 and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increased provision for income taxes was mainly due to an increase in the nine month effective rate to 30.6% from 25.4% and by the $154,000 increase in pre-tax earnings for the nine months of 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 is due primarily to the effect of higher projected pre-tax income while maintaining the same level of tax-advantaged income, such as bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt municipal bonds.  

Merrimack Mortgage Segment 

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016. 

Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are discussed below. The Bank acquired Merrimack Mortgage on July 1, 2015.  

Net Income.     Merrimack Mortgage recorded net income of $1.8 million and $2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 net income was $792,000. Exclusive of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $7.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 

Noninterest Income.      During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income totaled $15.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively.  Included in these amounts were gains on sales of mortgage loans of $13.1 million and $31.4 million, respectively, and loan fees, including servicing related income, of $2.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 noninterest income was $9.6 million, including $8.5 million in gains on sales of mortgage loans and $1.4 million in loan fees. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Merrimack Mortgage originated $992.7 million of residential mortgage loans. The following tables provide additional loan production detail (dollars presented in thousands):

Included in the gain on mortgage sales was $2.3 million and $5.9 million of originated mortgage servicing rights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Originated mortgage serving rights were $1.3 million for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Merrimack Mortgage sold $239.0 million and $581.4 million of loans to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae and recorded an average originated mortgage servicing right gain of 0.96% and 1.01%, respectively, of the underlying mortgage amount.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were $128.5 million of agency loan sales at an average originated mortgage servicing right gain of 1.01%. 

Merrimack Mortgage s mortgage loan servicing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in processing, underwriting and closing fees from customers and secondary market loan servicing fees, net of loan guarantee fees of $27,000 and $59,000, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the unpaid balance of the servicing portfolio totaled $1.09 billion as compared to $708.7 million at December 31, 2015.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $2.9 million and $362,000, respectively, driven primarily by the reduction in market interest rates during the period. Decreasing interest rates generally result in a decrease in mortgage servicing rights fair value as the assumed prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans tend to increase.  Conversely, as interest rates rise and prepayment speeds slow, mortgage servicing rights fair value tend to increase.  At the end of third quarter of 2016 rates began to rise which resulted in $196,000 increase in mortgage servicing rights fair value. 

Noninterest Expense.      Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $12.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Salary and benefits expenses totaled $9.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Salary expense was $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and commission-related expenses were $5.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, or 1.31% and 1.31% of closed loan volume. Loan expenses totaled $2.9 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and included direct loan origination expenses of $2.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, associated with the origination of $422.4 million and $296.9 million of mortgage loans.  Sub-servicing related expenses for the same three month period were $189,000 and $227,000, respectively. Occupancy expense totaled $407,000 and $447,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and primarily consisted of rent and other expenses associated with the retail branch network and corporate office. Other expenses totaled $578,000 and $325,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and primarily consisted of marketing expense and professional fees. 

Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $30.3 million, salary and benefits was $21.7 million including $6.4 million in salary expense and $12.7 million in commission related expenses.  Additionally, loan expenses were $5.9 million and included $5.5 million of direct loan origination expenses associated with the origination of $ 992.7 million of mortgage loans and sub-servicing related expenses were $487,000.  Occupancy and other expense were $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

At September 30, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was $15.8 million, or 0.82% of total loans and 65.95% of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $13.7 million, or 0.79% of total loans and 45.56% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 were $24.0 million, or 1.25% of total loans, compared to $29.4 million, or 1.69% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. However, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover losses which may be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required. 

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated:

Analysis of Loan Loss Experience.   The following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated: 

We recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $325,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. This increase generally reflects commercial and commercial real estate loan growth which generally have higher general reserve allocations than consumer credits. The increases have been partially offset by declines in nonaccrual and net charge offs. Charge off rates, as the basis for residential real estate and consumer loan general reserve allocations, directly impacts the allowance for loan loss analysis as does lower allocated reserves resulting from the improved credit quality.

Management of Market Risk 

Net Interest Income Analysis.    The Bank uses income simulation as the primary tool for measuring interest-rate risk inherent in our balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over specified time frames and using different interest rate shocks and ramps. The assumptions include, but are not limited to, management s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet composition and market conditions. Assumptions are supported with quarterly back testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.  

As of September 30, 2016, net interest income simulation results for the Bank indicated that our exposure over one year to changing interest rates was within our guidelines. The following table presents the estimated impact of interest rate changes on our estimated net interest income over one year:

(1)   The calculated change in net interest income assumes an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve.  

Economic Value of Equity Analysis.    The Bank also uses the net present value of equity at risk, or "EVE," methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve up 300 basis points and down 100 basis points.  

The board of directors and management review the methodology s measurements for both net interest income and EVE on a quarterly basis to determine whether the exposure resulting from the changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2016, the estimated changes in the net economic value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for the Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.  

Liquidity Management and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities, and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.  

Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of our interest rate risk and investment policies.  

Our cash flows are composed of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Net cash used by operating activities was $39.5 million and $23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and loan purchases, the purchase of securities and the purchase of time deposits with other banks, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities, proceeds from redemption of time deposits and proceeds from maturing securities and sales of other real estate owned, and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, was $150.6 million and $79.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts, FHLB advances and the issuance of common stock was $168.7 million and $65.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting from our strategy of managing growth and cash flows to preserve capital ratios and reduce expenses.  

HarborOne Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2016, HarborOne Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines. See Note 11 to our unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 

At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $98.9 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $178.6 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2016 totaled $251.4 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may use FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  For additional information on financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk see Note 8 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

The information required by this Item is included in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading    Management of Market Risk.    

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company and its management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
