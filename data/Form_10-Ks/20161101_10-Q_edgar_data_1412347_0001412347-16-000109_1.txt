WESTMORELAND RESOURCE PARTNERS, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP, or the Partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and require the use of management s estimates. The financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is unaudited, but reflects all adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods shown. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  These unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 Form 10-K ). There were no changes to our significant accounting policies from those disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our   2015   Form 10-K, except as described below. 
  On August 1, 2015, Westmoreland Coal Company ( WCC ), who owns and controls the Westmoreland Resources GP, LLC ( GP ), the general partner of Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP, contributed   100%   of the outstanding equity interests in Westmoreland Kemmerer, LLC ( WKL ) to the Partnership (the  Kemmerer Drop ). The Kemmerer Drop was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805-50, which requires that the transaction be presented as though it occurred at the beginning of the period, and prior years retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information similar to the pooling method. Accordingly, our financial statements give retrospective effect to the Kemmerer Drop for periods as of and subsequent to December 31, 2014, the earliest point of common control. Information about our acquisition and the accounting for the Kemmerer Drop is in Note 1,    Organization and Presentation    and Note 3,    Acquisition and Pushdown Accounting  ,  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )  2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 and retrospectively applied the guidance to prior periods. 
  Accounting Pronouncements Effective in the Future 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , issued as a new Topic, ASU Topic 606. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Partnership can either adopt these standards retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-02 require companies that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations generated by contracts longer than one year. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

4.     RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES    
    Restructuring Charges 
  Concurrent with WCC s acquisition of the GP and approximately   79.1%   of our limited partner interests completed in December 2014 (collectively, the  WCC Transactions ), we and WCC initiated a restructuring plan to streamline operations and eliminate duplicative roles and responsibilities across the two organizations. Total restructuring charges which concluded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the WCC Transactions of   $3.4 million   have been recorded to the restructuring and impairment expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations. 
  The table below represents the restructuring provision activity related to the restructuring plan: 

Impairment Charges 
  In April 2016, we entered into an agreement (the  Purchase Coal Agreement ) to purchase   1.0 million   tons of coal ( Purchased Coal ) from a third party through December 31, 2017. The Purchased Coal will be used to fulfill specific customer sales orders under preexisting long-term sales agreements. As a result of the Purchased Coal Agreement, we down-sized our work force and incurred and paid   $0.3 million   severance charge during the   three   months ended June 30, 2016 and an impairment charge on excess equipment of   $4.2 million   for the   three   months ended June 30, 2016. Impairment charges for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $3.2 million   on a shovel which was parted and scrapped during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We intend to market and sell the excess equipment and have reflected the expected amount to be recovered, based on prices for similar assets, as    Assets held for sale    on the consolidated balance sheet. 
   
  5.     LONG-TERM DEBT 
  Debt consisted of the following:

     Table of Contents  
  WESTMORELAND RESOURCE PARTNERS, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

The following table presents aggregate contractual debt maturities of all long-term debt:    

Credit Facilities 
  On December 31, 2014, we entered into a Financing Agreement with the lenders party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative and collateral agent (the  2014 Financing Agreement ). As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a term loan of   $304.8 million   outstanding under the 2014 Financing Agreement. Borrowings on such term loan bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to, at our option, the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) (floor of   0.75%   plus   8.5%  ) or the Reference Rate (as defined in the 2014 Financing Agreement). As of   September 30, 2016  , the 2014 Financing Agreement had a cash interest rate of   9.25%  , consisting of the LIBOR floor (  0.75%  ) plus   8.5%  . The term loan under the 2014 Financing Agreement matures in December   2018  .  
  The 2014 Financing Agreement also provides for  PIK Interest  (as defined in the 2014 Financing Agreement) at a variable rate per annum between   1.00%   and   3.00%   based on our Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2014 Financing Agreement). The rate of PIK Interest is recalculated on a quarterly basis with the PIK Interest added quarterly to the then-outstanding principal amount of the term loan under the 2014 Financing Agreement. PIK Interest under the 2014 Financing Agreement was   $2.3 million   and   $6.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The outstanding term loan amount represents the principal balance of   $291.0 million  , plus PIK Interest of   $13.7 million  . 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid down   $0.9 million   and   $1.4 million   of the term loan under the 2014 Financing Agreement with proceeds from oil and gas royalties and  right-of-way payments received. The 2014 Financing Agreement requires mandatory prepayment of principal with proceeds from such events. 
  In connection with the Kemmerer Drop, we amended the 2014 Financing Agreement on July 31, 2015 to (i) allow us to make cash distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed   $15.0 million   (previously   $7.5 million  ) when our Consolidated Total Net Leverage ratio is more than   3.75   or Fixed Charge Coverage ratio is less than   1.00   (as such ratios are defined in the 2014 Financing Agreement) and (ii) at any time that we have a revolving loan facility available, require us to have liquidity of at least   $7.5 million   (previously   $5.0 million  ), after giving effect to such cash distributions and applying availability under such revolving loan facility towards satisfying the liquidity requirement ( Restricted Distributions ). As of   September 30, 2016  , we have made   $14.1 million   in Restricted Distributions.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the terms of the 2014 Financing Agreement. 
  On October 23, 2015, WMLP and its subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) with the lenders party thereto and The PrivateBank and Trust Company, as administrative agent, which permits borrowings up to the aggregate principal amount of   $15.0 million   and letters of credit in an aggregate outstanding amount of up to   $10.0 million  , which reduces availability under the Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The Revolving Credit Facility contains the same terms as the 2014 Financing Agreement regarding Restricted Distributions. At   September 30, 2016  , availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was   $15.0 million  .

Deferred Financing Costs 
  Due to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, debt issuance costs related to our debt liabilities are now reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the notes. This change in accounting principle had the effect of reducing the non-current asset,   Deposits and other assets   and non-current liability,   Long-term debt, less current installments  , by $  8.0 million   as of December 31, 2015. 
  Capital Leases 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into   $9.3 million   of new capital leases. 
   
  6.     POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS, PENSION AND OTHER SAVING PLANS 
  Immediately prior to the Kemmerer Drop and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement, dated July 31, 2015, between the Partnership and WCC (the  Contribution Agreement ), all employees of WKL were transferred to WCC. On August 1, 2015, WCC assumed all liabilities, including the pension assets, associated with the transferred employees, including but not limited to all post-retirement pension, medical, other benefits and the related deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which were not contributed as part of the transaction. 
  Prior to August 1, 2015, WKL provided postretirement medical benefits and a defined benefit pension plan to qualified full-time employees pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The postretirement medical benefits were provided through self-insurance programs. The pension benefits are generally based on years of service and a specific dollar amount per year of service as specified in the plan agreement. As the Kemmerer Drop is accounted for as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control, our consolidated financial statements include the historical results of WKL, including postretirement medical expense, pension expense and income taxes, for the periods while under common control prior to the Kemmerer Drop (period of December 31, 2014 through August 1, 2015). In accordance with the Contribution Agreement, subsequent to the Kemmerer Drop, WCC, in compliance with the services agreement with our GP, as amended through the date hereof (the  Services Agreement ), and the Partnership s fourth amended and restated partnership agreement, as amended (the  Partnership Agreement ), will allocate expenses incurred for postretirement medical liabilities and pension liabilities attributable to the transferred employees on a cash basis through the period ending December 31, 2017.  Thereafter, WCC shall allocate such expenses in its sole discretion, in compliance with the Services Agreement and the Partnership Agreement. 
  Postretirement Medical Benefits 
  WKL provided postretirement medical benefits to retired employees and their dependents, as mandated by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Act of 1992 and pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. WKL also provided these benefits to qualified full-time employees pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. These benefits are provided through self-insured programs. 
  The components of net periodic postretirement medical benefit cost are as follows: 

These costs are included in the accompanying statements of operations in   Cost of coal revenues   and   Selling and administrative   expenses.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Pension 
  WKL provided a defined benefit pension plan to qualified full-time employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. WKL s funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount prescribed, as specified by applicable regulations.  
  The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: 

These costs are included in the accompanying statements of operations in   Cost of coal revenues   and   Selling and administrative   expenses. 
   
  7.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
  The book values of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the immediate short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  
  In connection with our refinancing in June 2013, certain of the second lien lenders and lender affiliates received warrants entitling them to purchase common units. The warrants are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of each warrant was   $5.49  , based on the following assumptions: spot price of   $5.61   per unit as traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exercise price of   $0.12   per unit. The fair value of the warrants are a Level 1 measurement. 
  See   Note 3   for additional disclosures related to fair value measurements of restricted investments. 
   
  8.     DISTRIBUTIONS OF AVAILABLE CASH 
  We distribute   100%   of our available cash within   45   days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our GP, subject to the conditions and limitations within the 2014 Financing Agreement. Available cash is determined at the end of each quarter and is generally defined in the Partnership Agreement as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established by our GP in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are retained to provide for the conduct of our business, the payment of debt principal and interest and to provide funds for future distributions for any one or more of the next four quarters, and to comply with applicable law. Our available cash may also include, if our GP so determines, all or any portion of the cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter. 
  We made cash distributions as follows (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  
  WESTMORELAND RESOURCE PARTNERS, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

On October 28, 2016, we declared a quarterly cash distribution for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $0.1333   per common unit and warrant with distribution rights. Additionally, we declared a paid-in-kind unit distribution of   $0.1333   per Series A Convertible Unit.  The cash distribution totaling approximately   $0.2 million  , will be paid to all common unitholders and warrant holders on November 14, 2016 to all unitholders of record as of November 7, 2016. 
   
  9.     ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our asset retirement obligation ( ARO ) totaled   $57.4 million  , including amounts reported as current liabilities.  
  Changes in the Partnership s ARO were as follows:  

The   $5.0 million   increase in the asset retirement obligation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the result of updated costs estimates, changes in mine plans and reclamation consents. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had   $137.2 million   in surety bonds outstanding to secure reclamation obligations. 
   
  10.   LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN     
  We grant employees and non-employee directors restricted common units under our Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ). 
  We recognized compensation expense from unit-based arrangements shown in the following table: 

A summary of restricted common unit award activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:

11.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Coal Sales Contracts 
  We are committed under long-term contracts to sell coal that meets certain quality requirements at specified prices. Many of these prices are subject to cost pass-through or cost adjustment provisions that mitigate some risk from rising costs. Quantities sold under some of these contracts may vary from year to year within certain limits at the option of the customer or us. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining terms of our long-term contracts range from   one   to   ten   years. 
  Purchase   Commitments    
  In April 2016, we entered into a fixed price agreement to purchase   1.0 million   tons of coal from a third party through December 31, 2017.  
  From time to time, we purchase coal from third parties in order to meet quality or delivery requirements under our customer contracts. We buy coal on the spot market, and the cost of that coal is dependent upon the market price and quality of the coal.  
  Legal and Regulatory 
  The Partnership is party to various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business at any point in time. We record accruals for potential losses related to these matters when, in management s opinion, such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Based on known facts and circumstances, we believe the ultimate outcome of these outstanding lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the results of these matters were different from management s current opinion and in amounts greater than our accruals, then they could have a material adverse effect. 
  Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 
  In May 2016 the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency s Department of Permitting ( OEPA ) notified us in writing that they believe   twelve   of our previously remediated Oxford mines have failed to meet the performance goals set forth in their approved mitigation plans. The OEPA letters allow that we may either a) evidence that their listed mitigation deficiencies are actually meeting the performance standards, b) request an extension of up to   2 years   to complete the outstanding mitigation obligations, or c) pursue other off-site mitigation credits. Our evaluation of the OEPA s claims is not yet complete, however based on the nature of their claims we believe it is reasonably possible that some level of remediation efforts will be required, although we cannot reasonably determine an estimate of loss at this time. 
  Guarantees 
  Our GP and the Partnership guarantee certain obligations of our subsidiaries. We believe that these guarantees will expire without any liability to the guarantors, and therefore will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or operations.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

12.   PARTNERS' CAPITAL AND CONVERTIBLE UNITS    
  Our capital accounts are comprised of approximately   0.16%   beneficial general partner interests and   99.84%   limited partner interests as of   September 30, 2016  . Our limited partners have limited rights of ownership as provided for under our Partnership Agreement and the right to participate in our distributions. Our General Partner manages our operations and participates in our distributions, including certain incentive distributions pursuant to the incentive distribution rights that are nonvoting limited partner interests held by our General Partner. Pursuant to our Partnership Agreement, our General Partner participates in losses and distributions based on its interest. The General Partner's participation in the allocation of losses and distributions is not limited and therefore, such participation can result in a deficit to its capital account. As such, allocation of losses and distributions, including distributions for previous transactions between entities under common control, has resulted in a deficit to the Limited Partners  capital account included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Series A Convertible Units 
  WCC owner of our General Partner hold and participate in distributions on our Series A Convertible Units. Series A Convertible Units have the right to share in distributions from us on a pro-rata basis with the common units. All or any portion of each distribution payable in respect of the Series A Convertible Units (the  Series A Convertible Unit Distribution ) may, at our Board of Directors' election, be paid in Series A paid-in-kind Units ( Series A PIK Units ). To the extent any portion of the Series A Convertible Unit Distribution is paid in Series A PIK Units for any quarter, the distribution to the holders of incentive distribution rights shall be reduced by that portion of the distribution that is attributable to the payment of those Series A PIK Units. The Series A Convertible Units will convert into common units, on a   one  -for-one basis, at the earlier of the date on which we first make a regular quarterly cash distribution with respect to any quarter to holders of common units in an amount at least equal to   $0.22   per common unit or upon a change of control. The Series A Convertible Units have the same voting rights as if they were outstanding common units and will vote together with the common units as a single class. In addition, the Series A Convertible Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matters that materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Series A Convertible Units in relation to other classes of partnership interests or as required by law. 
  Series B Convertible Units 
  On October 28, 2016, we issued   4,512,500   Series B Convertible Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Series B Units ) to WCC in exchange for WCC s   4,512,500   common units (the  Exchange ). Upon issuance of the Series B Units in the Exchange, WCC s common units were canceled.  
  The Series B Units do not share in distributions with the common units and are convertible at the option of the holder on a   one  -for-one basis into common units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the common units in which the Partnership is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the 2014 Financing Agreement. The Series B Units will convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of the Partnership. The Series B Units have the same voting rights as if they were outstanding common units and will vote together with the common units as a single class. In addition, the Series B Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matters that materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Series B Units in relation to other classes of partnership interests or as required by law. 
  Concurrently with the Exchange, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Partnership Agreement, which established the terms of the Series B Units. 
  Liquidation Units 
  All subordinated units were transferred to WCC in connection our General Partner being acquired on December 31, 2014. These units were then converted to liquidation units which have no distribution or voting rights, other than in connection with liquidation. For tax purposes, liquidation units are allocated additional taxable income but no additional taxable loss compared to other unit classes. 
  Warrants 
  In June 2013, in connection with a prior credit facility, certain lenders and lender affiliates received warrants entitling them to purchase   166,557   common units at   $0.12   per unit. The warrants participate in distributions whether or not exercised.

  Net Income (Loss) attributable to Limited Partners 
  Net income (loss) is allocated to the General Partner and the limited partners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, after giving effect to distributions and declared distribution on Series A Convertible Units, and General Partner units, including incentive distribution rights. Unvested unit-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions (whether paid or unpaid) are classified as participating securities and are included in our computation of basic and diluted limited partners' net income (loss) per common unit. Basic and diluted limited partners' net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing limited partners' interest in net income (loss) by the weighted average number of outstanding limited partner units during the period. We determined basic and diluted limited partners' net income (loss) per common unit as follows (in thousands, except per unit amounts): 

1   Unvested LTIP units are not dilutive units for the periods presented herein, but could be in the future. Anti-dilutive units are not used in calculating diluted average units.

14.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  In connection with our formation in August 2007, the Partnership and Oxford Mining   Company, LLC ( Oxford Mining )   entered into an administrative and operational services agreement (the  Services Agreement ) with our GP. The Services Agreement is terminable by either party upon   thirty   days  written notice. Under the terms of the Services Agreement, our GP provides services through its employees to us and is reimbursed for all related costs incurred on our behalf. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, the Partnership engaged the GP to continue providing services such as general administrative and management, engineering, operations (including mining operations), geological, corporate development, real property, marketing, and other services to the Partnership. Administrative services include without limitation legal, finance and accounting, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit and tax. Under the Services Agreement the Partnership pays the GP a fixed annual management fee of   $2.2 million   for certain executive and administrative services, and reimburses the GP at cost for other expenses and expenditures. The current terms of the Services Agreement expires on December 31,   2016  , and automatically renews for successive   one year   periods unless terminated. The primary reimbursements to our GP under the Service Agreement during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were for costs related to payroll. Reimbursable costs under the Services Agreement totaling   $0.2 million   and   $4.2 million   were included in accounts payable as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively. In December 2015, the Partnership prepaid the GP for the 2016 annual management fee of   $2.2 million  , of which   $0.5 million   was included in   Other current assets   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Finally, we sold coal to and performed various transportation and operational services for a subsidiary of WCC, which generated   $6.2 million   and   $20.5 million   in coal revenues and   $0.01 million   and   $0.03 million   in non-coal revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , receivables totaling   $8.0 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, were included in   Receivables - trade  .

  Overview 
  Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  WMLP . Westmoreland Coal Company, a Delaware corporation ( WCC ), owns 100% of our General Partner and, and as of the date of this filing,   93.8%    beneficial limited partner interest on a fully diluted basis. 
  We are a low-cost producer and marketer of high-value thermal coal to U.S. utilities and industrial users, and we are the largest producer of surface mined coal in eastern Ohio and Lincoln County, Wyoming. We focus on acquiring thermal coal reserves that we can efficiently mine with our large-scale equipment. Our reserves and operations are strategically located to serve our primary market area of the Midwest, northeastern U.S. and Wyoming.  
  We operate in a single business segment and have   five   operating subsidiaries, Oxford Mining, Oxford Mining Company-Kentucky, LLC ( Oxford Mining Kentucky ), Westmoreland Kemmerer Fee Coal Holdings, LLC ( WKFCH ), Westmoreland Kemmerer, LLC ( WKL ) and Harrison Resources, LLC ( Harrison Resources ). Our operating subsidiaries are primarily in the business of utilizing surface mining techniques to mine domestic coal and prepare it for sale to our customers or leasing our controlled coal reserves to others to mine. Our WKFCH and Harrison Resources operating subsidiaries own and hold coal reserves. Harrison Resources  coal reserves are surface mined and marketed by Oxford Mining. Oxford Mining Kentucky is an inactive operating subsidiary holding coal reserves in the Illinois Basin for which surface mining operation ceased in December 2013. 
  Series B Convertible Units 
  On October 28, 2016, we issued   4,512,500   Series B Convertible Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Series B Units ) to WCC in exchange for WCC s   4,512,500   common units (the  Exchange ). Upon issuance of the Series B Units in the Exchange, WCC s common units were canceled.  
  The Series B Units do not share in distributions with the common units and are convertible at the option of the holder on a   one  -for-one basis into common units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the common units in which the Partnership is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the 2014 Financing Agreement. The Series B Units will convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of the Partnership. The Series B Units have the same voting rights as if they were outstanding common units and will vote together with the common units as a single class. In addition, the Series B Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matters that materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Series B Units in relation to other classes of partnership interests or as required by law. 
  Concurrently with the Exchange, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Partnership Agreement, which established the terms of the Series B Units.

  Overview 

1   Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined and reconciled to net income (loss) at the end of this  Results of Operations  section. 
    
  Total revenue was   $90.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $4.0 million  , or   4.2%  , from   $94.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net loss for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.3 million  , compared to a net loss for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $12.7 million  . Adjusted EBITDA was   $22.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $6.6 million   from   $16.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Revenues 

Coal sales revenue was   $89.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $3.4 million  , or   3.7%  , from   $93.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a   2.1%   decrease in tons sold in the amount of   $2.0 million  , compounded by a   $0.72   per ton, or an aggregate   $1.5 million  , decrease in the average sale price per ton for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .    
  Non-coal revenues, primarily from limestone sales, non-coal services and other miscellaneous revenue was   $0.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.6 million  , from   $1.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   decrease in other revenue and limestone, respectively, compounded by a   $0.2 million   decrease in oil and gas royalties.  
  Cost of Coal     Revenues    

Cost of coal revenues (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) was   $65.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $11.8 million  , or   15.2%  , from   $77.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a   2.1%   decrease in tons sold, which corresponds to a   $1.6 million   decrease in cost of coal revenues, and a decrease in the cost to produce coal of   $5.01   per ton, or an aggregate   $10.2

     Table of Contents  

million  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in the cost to produce coal of   $5.01   per ton was primarily attributed to lower fuel prices and mine operating efficiencies.  
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 

DD A expense was   $11.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $3.9 million  , or   25.2%  , from   $15.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Amortization expense was   $0.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $1.7 million   decrease from   $2.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the asset retirement costs on closed mines resulting from revisions to cost estimates. Depreciation expense decreased   $1.5 million  , or   14.3%  , to   $9.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $10.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller operating fleet. Depletion expense was   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $0.7 million   decrease from   $2.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily attributable to the production and sale of   44.0 thousand   fewer coal tons during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Selling and Administrative 

Selling and administrative expenses were   $3.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.8 million  , or   20.0%  , from   $4.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily the result of cost reduction efforts made during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Nonoperating Results (including interest expense, interest income, other income, and change in fair value of warrants) 

Our interest expense increased   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $10.4 million   compared to   $8.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to the $120.0 million in additional debt incurred in connection with the Kemmerer Drop on August 1, 2015. 
   We recognized a loss in the change in fair value of warrants of   $0.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.4 million   compared to   $0.3 million   of income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Overview 

1   Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined and reconciled to net income (loss) at the end of this  Results of Operations  section. 
    
  Total revenue was   $263.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $33.7 million  , or   11.3%  , from   $297.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $27.6 million  , compared to a net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $25.3 million  . Adjusted EBITDA was   $58.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $8.5 million   from   $49.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Revenues 

Coal sales revenue was   $260.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $28.6 million  , or   9.9%  , from   $288.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a   7.8%   decrease in sales tons in the amount of   $22.6 million  , compounded by a   $1.01   per ton, or an aggregate   $6.0 million  , decrease in the average sale price per ton for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .    
  Non-coal revenues, primarily from limestone sales, non-coal services and other miscellaneous revenue was   $3.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $5.1 million  , from   $8.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a   $3.1 million   decrease in non-coal services, primarily due to $2.4 million in non-recurring coal handling and transportation service revenue performed on behalf of a subsidiary of WCC during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Additionally, other revenue decrease   $1.4 million   and limestone revenue decreased   $0.9 million  , offset in part by a   $0.2 million   increase in oil and gas royalties. The   $1.4 million   decrease in other revenue was due primarily to generating $1.8 million in June 2015 compared to $0.6 million in June 2016 in lost coal fees for granting two respective pipeline right-of-ways to multiple third parties.  
  Cost of Coal     Revenues    

Cost of coal revenues (excluding DD A) was   $199.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $39.0 million  , or   16.3%  , from   $238.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was

primarily attributable to a decrease of   0.5 million   in tons sold, which corresponds to a   $18.7 million   decrease in cost of coal revenues, and a decrease in the cost to produce coal of   $3.43   per ton, or an aggregate   $20.3 million  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in the cost to produce coal of   $3.43   per ton was primarily attributed to lower fuel prices and mine operating efficiencies.  
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 

DD A expense was   $41.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.9 million  , or   6.5%  , from   $44.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Amortization expense was   $8.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $3.4 million   increase from   $5.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the asset retirement costs on closed mines resulting from revisions to cost estimates. Depreciation expense decreased   $4.7 million  , or   14.6%  , to   $27.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $32.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a smaller operating fleet. Depletion expense was   $5.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $1.6 million   decrease from   $6.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily attributable to the production and sale of   0.5 million   fewer coal tons during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Selling and Administrative 

Selling and administrative expenses were   $9.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $3.6 million  , or   27.9%  , from   $12.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily the result of cost reduction efforts made during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Non-Operating Results (including interest expense, interest income, other income, and change in fair value of warrants) 

Our interest expense increased   $9.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $30.5 million   compared to   $20.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to the   $120.0 million   in additional debt incurred in connection with the Kemmerer Drop on August 1, 2015. 
  Our interest income was   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.1 million   from   $0.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting from a decrease in average cash on hand throughout the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

We recognized expense from the change in fair value of warrants of   $0.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $1.1 million   compared to   $0.8 million   of income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $0.3 million   of expense is the result of the increase in value of our units traded on the NYSE during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principals ( GAAP ). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by us to assess our operating performance, and we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because these measures: 
             
    are used widely by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; and 
                
    help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results. 
     Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant in assessing our operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
             
    do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 
                
    do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on certain of our debt obligations. 
     In addition, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Other companies in our industry and in other industries may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way that we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental data. 
  Distributable Cash Flow 
  Distributable Cash Flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less cash changes in deferred revenue, cash reclamation and mine closure expenditures, reserve replacement and maintenance capital expenditures,  cash pension and postretirement medical expenditures, and cash interest expense (net of interest income). Cash interest expense represents the portion of our interest expense accrued and paid in cash during the reporting periods presented or that we will pay in cash in future periods as the obligations become due. Other maintenance capital expenditures represent expenditures for coal reserve replacement, and for plant, equipment and mine development. Cash reclamation expenditures represent the reduction to our reclamation and mine closure costs resulting from cash payments. Earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest are not available for distribution to our unitholders and accordingly are deducted. 
  Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to our unitholders, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Although Distributable Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, we believe Distributable Cash Flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance, facilitating comparison with the performance of other publicly traded limited partnerships.

The tables below show how we calculated EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow and reconcile EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net Loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  
  Reconciliation of Net Loss to Distributable Cash Flows:

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Liquidity  
  We had the following liquidity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

We anticipate that our cash from operations, cash on hand and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our investing, financing, and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.  
  Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for, among other things, purchasing, maintaining and upgrading equipment used in developing and mining our coal, and acquiring reserves. Our principal liquidity needs are to finance current operations, replace reserves, fund capital expenditures, including costs of acquisitions from time to time, service our debt and pay quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders. Our primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs have been cash generated by our operations, borrowings under the 2014 Financing Agreement, and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, meet debt service obligations and fund planned capital expenditures substantially depends upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry. To the extent our future operating cash flow or access to financing sources and the costs thereof are materially different than expected, our future liquidity may be adversely affected. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our available liquidity was   $23.9 million  , which included   $8.9 million   in cash and   $15.0 million   of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility.  
  Debt Obligations  
   As of   September 30, 2016   the outstanding balance on our 2014 Financing Agreement was   $304.8 million  . This amount represents the principal balance of   $291.0 million  , plus PIK interest of   $13.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our 2014 Financing Agreement had a cash interest rate of   9.25%  , consisting of the LIBOR floor (  0.75%  ) plus   8.50%  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was   $15.0 million  . 
  Cash Distribution  
  Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash quarterly. Under our partnership agreement, available cash is determined at the end of each quarter and generally defined as cash generated from our business in excess of the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide for the conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law, to make payments related to any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters. Our available cash may also include, if our general partner so determines, all or any portion of the cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter. 
  Both our 2014 Financing Agreement and Revolving Credit Facility restrict us from making cash distributions in excess of $15.0 million in the aggregate when certain ratios and liquidity requirements are not met, see Note 5 of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in  Part I   Item 1   Financial Statements.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we have distributed   $14.1 million   in cash that count toward the $15.0 million in aggregate restricted distribution payments. On October 28, 2016, we declared a quarterly cash distribution for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , of   $0.1333   per common unit, warrant with distribution rights and a distribution of Series A PIK Units in lieu of a cash distribution for holders of Series A Convertible Units ( Third Quarter Distribution ).  The Third Quarter Distribution, totaling approximately   $0.2 million  , for all common unitholders and warrant holders of record as of November 7, 2016, will be paid November 14, 2016. The Third Quarter Distribution will bring the aggregate remaining permitted restricted distributions total to   $0.8 million   at that time. 
  On October 28, 2016, we issued   4,512,500   Series B Convertible Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Series B Units ) to WCC in exchange for WCC s   4,512,500   common units (the  Exchange ). Upon issuance of the Series B Units in the Exchange, WCC s common units were canceled. The Series B Units do not share in distributions with the common units and are convertible at the option of the holder on a   one  -for-one basis into common units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the common units in which the Partnership is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the 2014 Financing Agreement.  
  Historical Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The following table summarizes net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

     Table of Contents  

Net cash provided by operating activities was   $25.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $28.8 million   of net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $3.4 million  . The decrease of   $3.4 million   resulted from a net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $27.6 million  , an increase of   $2.3 million  , compared to net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $25.3 million  , a decrease of   $8.6 million   in cash provided by change in working capital and a   $2.9 million   decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, offset in part by an increase of   $7.4 million   in restructuring and impairment charges, and a    $2.3 million   increase in non-cash interest expense. The   $8.6 million   change in working capital resulted from   $12.1 million   decrease in cash flows from accounts receivables resulting from extending payment terms to a subsidiary of WCC, a decrease in cash flow of   $2.8 million   from the change in asset retirement obligation and a   $2.7 million   decrease in cash flows from a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, offset in part by   $4.8 million   increase in cash flows from the change in deferred revenue and a   $5.0 million   in cash flow from inventory. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $7.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $129.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of approximately   $122.2 million  . The   $122.2 million   decrease was attributable to   $115.0 million   in acquisition cost related to the August 1, 2015 acquisition of Westmoreland Kemmerer LLC compounded by a   $6.8 million   decrease in capital expenditure spend. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $13.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   $119.3 million   from net cash provided by financing activities of   $106.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $13.0 million   of cash flows used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisted of   $9.8 million   of cash used in distributions to partners and   $3.2 million   of cash used in the repayment of long-term debt. 
  Capital Expenditures  
  Our mining operations require investments to maintain, expand, and upgrade existing operations and to meet environmental and safety regulations. We have funded and expect to continue funding capital expenditures primarily from cash generated by our operations, borrowings under the 2014 Financing Agreement, and proceeds from asset sales. In the future, we may also fund capital expenditures with borrowings under the Loan Facility. 
  The following table summarizes our capital expenditures by type for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  .

AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO 
  FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF 
  WESTMORELAND RESOURCE PARTNERS, LP  
  This Amendment No. 2 (this    Amendment   ) to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP (the    Partnership   ), dated as of December 31, 2014, as amended on August 1, 2015 (the    Partnership Agreement   ), is hereby adopted effective as of October 28, 2016 by Westmoreland Resources GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the    General Partner   ), as general partner of the Partnership, pursuant to the authority granted to it in Section 5.6 and Section 13.1 of the Partnership Agreement.

WHEREAS  , the General Partner deems it in the best interest of the Partnership to effect this Amendment in order to (i) specify the rights and obligations of the Series B Convertible Units and (ii) provide for such other matters as are provided herein. 
  NOW THEREFORE  , the General Partner does hereby amend the Partnership Agreement as follows:

For the avoidance of doubt, the Series A Convertible Units and the Series B Convertible Units will be treated as a partnership interest in the Partnership that are  convertible equity  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.721-2(g)(3), and, therefore, each holder of a Series A Convertible Unit or a Series B Convertible Unit will be treated as a partner in the Partnership, other than with respect to the conversion features of the Series A Convertible Units and the Series B Convertible Units.  The initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A Convertible Unit (including each Series A PIK Unit) shall be the Series A Issue Price. The initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series B Convertible Unit shall be the Series B Issue Price.

If, following the transfer, the transferor Partner retains Units in the Partnership, the transferor s Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) above, and the transferee s Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Series B Conversion Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A) above. 
  6.  Section 5.5(d)   is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.5(d)(v) as follows:

   7 

EXHIBIT 3.4 

each such Series B Conversion Unit, as applicable, is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit) or Unrealized Loss (if the Capital Account of each such Series B Conversion Unit, as applicable, is greater than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit) had been allocated Pro Rata to each Partner holding Series B Conversion Units received upon such conversion until the Capital Account of each such Series B Conversion Unit, as applicable, is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit; and (B) second, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to Section 6.1(c) and Section 6.1(d).  In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets immediately after the conversion of a Series B Convertible Unit shall be determined by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt (taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code);   provided, however  , that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2).  The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership in such manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable.  If, after making the allocations of Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth above in this Section 5.5(d)(v), the Capital Account of each Partner with respect to each Series B Conversion Unit, as applicable, received upon such conversion of the Series B Convertible Unit, as applicable, is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit, then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding Common Units (other than Series B Conversion Units) and Partners holding Series B Conversion Units, as applicable, so as to cause the Capital Account of each Partner holding a Series B Conversion Unit, as applicable, to equal, on a per Unit basis with respect to each such Series B Conversion Unit, the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit. 
  7.  Section 5.9(a)   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 
  (a) Subject to Section 5.9(d), Section 6.6 and Section 6.9 (dealing with adjustments of distribution levels), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units (including the number of Common Units into which Series A Convertible Units or Series B Convertible Units may convert) are proportionately adjusted. 
  8.  Section 5.9   is hereby amended to add a new   Section 5.9(g)   as follows: 
  (g) For the avoidance of doubt, upon any Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record Holders of Common Units or any subdivision or combination (or reclassification into a greater or smaller number) of Common Units, the Partnership will proportionately adjust the number of Series B Convertible Units as follows: (i) if the Partnership issues Partnership Interests as a distribution on its Common Units or subdivides the Common Units (or reclassifies them into a greater number of Common Units), then the Series B Convertible Units shall be

EXHIBIT 3.4 

subdivided into a number of Series B Convertible Units equal to the result of multiplying the number of Series B Convertible Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such distribution or subdivision plus the total number of Partnership Interests constituting such distribution or newly created by such subdivision, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such distribution or subdivision, and (ii) if the Partnership combines the Common Units (or reclassifies them into a smaller number of Common Units), then the Series B Convertible Units shall be combined into a number of Series B Convertible Units equal to the result of multiplying the number of Series B Convertible Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units outstanding immediately following such combination, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such combination.   
  9.  Section 5.14(e)   is hereby amended and restated as follows: 
  The Series A Convertible Units will have such voting rights pursuant to the Agreement as such Series A Convertible Units would have if they were Common Units that were then outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units and the Series B Convertible Units as a single class, except that the Series A Convertible Units shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter on which Unitholders are entitled to vote that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Series A Convertible Units in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests in any material respect or as required by law. The approval of a majority of the Outstanding Series A Convertible Units shall be required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Series A Convertible Units are entitled to vote as a separate class. For the avoidance of doubt, each reference in this Agreement to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, Unitholders holding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, Unitholders of Common Units, Series A Convertible Units and Series B Convertible Units and each reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, a majority of the Outstanding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, a majority of the Common Units, Series A Convertible Units and Series B Convertible Units, each as Outstanding at such time.

EXHIBIT 3.4 

whole or in part, upon the request of the Series B Convertible Unitholder into Common Units on a one-for-one basis. 
  (ii) Immediately before any event causing the dissolution or liquidation of the Partnership or a Change of Control, the Series B Convertible Units shall automatically convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis. 
  (iii) To convert Series B Convertible Units into Common Units pursuant to Section 5.15(b)(i), the Series B Convertible Unitholder shall give written notice (a    Series B Conversion Notice   ) to the Partnership in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto stating that such Series B Convertible Unitholder elects to so convert Series B Convertible Units and shall state therein with respect to Series B Convertible Units to be converted pursuant to Section 5.15(b)(i) the following: (a) the number of Series B Convertible Units to be converted, (b) the Certificate(s) evidencing the Series B Convertible Units to be converted and duly endorsed, (c) the name or names in which such Series B Convertible Unitholder wishes the Certificate or Certificates for Series B Conversion Units to be issued, and (d) such Series B Convertible Unitholder s computation of the number of Series B Conversion Units to be received by such Series B Convertible Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)).

The Transfer Agent may refuse to deliver the Certificate representing Common Units being issued in a name other than the holder s name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due because the Common Units are to be issued in a name other than the holder s name.  Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulation.

  (D) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give to any holder of Series B Convertible Units any rights as a creditor in respect of its right to conversion. 
  (c)   Allocations  .  Except as otherwise provided in this Amendment, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit, including Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss to be allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1, shall be allocated to the Series B Convertible Units to the same extent as such items would be so allocated if the Series B Convertible Units were Common Units then Outstanding.

The approval of a majority of the Outstanding Series B Convertible Units shall be required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Series B Convertible Units are entitled to vote as a separate class.  For the avoidance of doubt, each reference in this Agreement to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, Unitholders holding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, Unitholders of Common Units, Series A Convertible Units and Series B Convertible Units and each reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, a majority of the Outstanding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, a majority of the Common Units, Series A Convertible Units and Series B Convertible Units, each as Outstanding at such time.

  (D) At the election of the General Partner, after application of Section 5.5(d)(v), with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the conversion of any Series B Convertible Units into Common Units, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated to each Partner holding Series B Conversion Units in the proportion of the number of Series B Conversion Units held by such Partner to the total number of Series B Conversion Units then outstanding, until each such Partner has been  
  
   13 

EXHIBIT 3.4 

allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Series B Conversion Units to an amount that, after taking into account the other allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction to be made with respect to such taxable period, will be equal to the product of (i) the number of Series B Conversion Units held by such Partner and (ii) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit that is not a Series B Conversion Unit.  The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Series B Conversion Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units that are not Series B Conversion Units. 
  14.  Section 6.3(a) is hereby amended and restated as follows  : 
  (a) Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner,   provided, however  ,     that Common Units and Series A Convertible Units issued in connection with the 2015 Contribution Agreement shall not be entitled to distributions and allocations with respect to any Quarter ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and Series B Convertible Units issued in connection with the 2016 Exchange Agreement (prior to conversion to Series B Conversion Units) shall not be entitled to distributions.  All amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date following the Westmoreland Closing Date from any source shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership to the Partners following the Westmoreland Closing Date pursuant to Section 6.4(b) equals the Operating Surplus from the Westmoreland Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter.  Any remaining amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on such date shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, be deemed to be  Capital Surplus.   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Partnership shall not make a distribution to any Partner on account of its interest in the Partnership if such distribution would violate the Delaware Act or any other applicable law. 
  15.  Section 6.10   is hereby amended to change all references to  Section 5.5(d)(iii)  to  Section 5.5(d)(iv).  
  16.  Article VI   is hereby amended to add a new   Section 6.11     as follows: 
  6.11      Special Provisions Relating to Series B Convertible Unitholders  . 
   (a) Subject to transfer restrictions in Section 4.8 of this Agreement, a Unitholder holding a Series B Conversion Unit shall provide notice to the Partnership of any Transfer of a Series B Conversion Unit by the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following such Transfer and (ii) the last Business Day of the calendar year during which such Transfer occurred, unless (x) the Transfer is to an Affiliate of such Unitholder or (y) by virtue of the application of Section 5.5(d)(v) and Section 6.1(d)(x), the Partnership has previously determined, based on the advice of counsel, that the Series B Conversion Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit.  In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.11, the Partnership shall take whatever steps are required to provide  
  
   14 

EXHIBIT 3.4 

economic uniformity to the Series B Conversion Unit in preparation for a Transfer of such Unit;   provided, however  , that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units (for this purpose the allocations of income, gain, loss and deductions, and the making of any guaranteed payments or any reallocation of Capital Account balances among the Partners in accordance with Section 5.5(d)(v) or Section 6.1(d)(x) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4) with respect to Series B Convertible Units or Series B Conversion Units will be deemed not to have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units). 
  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the holders of the Series B Convertible Units (i) shall (A) possess the rights and obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to Article III and Article VII and (B) have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to Section 5.5 and all other provisions related thereto and (ii) shall not (A) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring the approval or vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, except as provided in Section 5.15 or (B) be entitled to any distributions other than as provided in Section 5.15, Article VI and Article XII. 
  B.   Agreement in Effect  . Except as hereby amended, the Partnership Agreement shall remain unchanged and unmodified and in full force and effect. 
  C.   Applicable Law  . This Amendment shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. 
  D.   Severability  . Each provision of this Amendment shall be considered severable and if for any reason any provision or provisions herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any existing or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this Amendment that are valid, enforceable and legal.

EXHIBIT 95.1 
  Mine Safety Disclosure 
  The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate coal mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). The disclosures reflect United States (U.S.) mining operations only, as these requirements do not apply to our mines operated outside the U.S.  
  Mine Safety Information.    Whenever the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a violation which describes the associated condition or practice and designates a timeframe within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the violation that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes vacated. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the company and mine. Since MSHA is a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, its jurisdiction applies only to our U.S. mines. As such, the mine safety disclosures that follow contain no information for our Canadian mines. 
  The table that follows reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The table includes only those mines that were issued orders or citations during the period presented and, commensurate with SEC regulations, does not reflect orders or citations issued to independent contractors working at our mines. Due to timing and other factors, our data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA. The proposed assessments for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were taken from the MSHA system as of   October 26, 2016  . 
  
   1 

(1) 
    Mine Act Section 104(a) citations are for alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal mine safety or health hazard. 
              (2) 
    Mine Act Section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the period of time specified in the citation. 
              (3) 
    Mine Act Section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 
              (4) 
    Total number of flagrant violations issued under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
              (5) 
    Mine Act Section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition. 
              (6) 
    Total dollar value of MSHA assessments proposed during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (7) 
    Total number of mining-related fatalities during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (8) 
    Mine Act Section 104(e) written notices are for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of a coal mine health or safety hazard, or the potential to have such a pattern. 
              (9) 
    Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) involving a coal mine owned and operated by us.  The number of legal actions pending as of   September 30, 2016   that fall into each of the following categories is as follows: 
     (a)  Contests of citations and orders:  0 
  (b)  Contests of proposed penalties:  0 
  (c)  Complaints for compensation:  0 
  (d)  Complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference:  0 
  (e)  Applications for temporary relief:  0 
  (f)  Appeals of judges' decisions or orders to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission:  0
