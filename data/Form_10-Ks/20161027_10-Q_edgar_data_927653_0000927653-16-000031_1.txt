    Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Presentation:    The condensed consolidated financial statements of McKesson Corporation ( McKesson,  the  Company,  or  we  and other similar pronouns) include the financial statements of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority owned or controlled companies.  For those consolidated subsidiaries where our ownership is less than 100%, the portion of the net income or loss allocable to the noncontrolling interests is reported as  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests  on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  We consider ourselves to control an entity if we are the majority owner of and have voting control over such entity.  We also assess control through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and determine which business entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  We consolidate VIEs when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and our proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in Other Income, Net. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.  
  The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, therefore, do not include all information and disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements.   
  To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of these financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts.  In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.   
  The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements, accounting policies and financial notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   previously filed with the SEC on May 5, 2016 ( 2016 Annual Report ).   
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  The Company s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31.  Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company s fiscal year. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  Share-Based Payments  : In March 2016, amended guidance was issued for employee share-based payment awards.  Under the amended guidance, all excess tax benefits ( windfalls ) and deficiencies ( shortfalls ) related to employee share-based compensation arrangements are recognized within income tax expense. Under the previous guidance, windfalls were recognized in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ) and shortfalls were only recognized to the extent they exceeded the pool of windfall tax benefits. The amended guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, rather than a financing activity. The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We elected to early adopt this amended guidance in the first quarter of 2017. The primary impact of the adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement on a prospective basis, rather than APIC.  As a result, discrete tax benefits of   $9 million   and   $46 million   were recognized in income tax expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  We also elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2017.  None of the other provisions in this amended guidance had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  FINANCIAL NOTES (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Business Combinations:   In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted amended guidance for an acquirer s accounting for measurement-period adjustments.  The amended guidance eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively and instead requires that measurement-period adjustments be recognized during the period in which it determines the adjustment.  In addition, the amended guidance requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Fair Value Measurement:    In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted amended guidance that limits disclosures and removes the requirement to categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy if the fair value of the investment is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  The amended guidance will primarily affect our fiscal 2017 annual disclosures related to our pension benefits.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  :  In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted amended guidance for a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.  The amended guidance requires customers to determine whether or not an arrangement contains a software license element.  If the arrangement contains a software element, the related fees paid should be accounted for as an acquisition of a software license.  If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it is accounted for as a service contract.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Debt Issuance Costs  :  In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted amended guidance for the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs on a retrospective basis.  The amended guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be reported on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amended guidance.  In August 2015, a clarification was added to this amended guidance that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements can continue to be deferred and presented as an asset on the balance sheet.  Upon adoption, unamortized debt issuance costs of   $40 million   were reclassified primarily from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt at March 31, 2016.  
  Consolidation:    In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted amended guidance for consolidating legal entities in which a reporting entity holds a variable interest.  The amended guidance modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs and changes the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  Consolidation:   In October 2016, amended guidance was issued that requires a single decision maker of a VIE to consider indirect economic interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control on a proportionate basis when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE.  This amendment does not change the existing characteristics of a primary beneficiary.  The amended guidance becomes effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2018 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory:   In October 2016, amended guidance was issued to require entities to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments:   In August 2016, amended guidance was issued to provide clarification on cash flow classification related to eight specific issues including contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investees.  The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 on a retrospective basis.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses:   In June 2016, amended guidance was issued, which will change the impairment model for most financial assets and require additional disclosures.  The amended guidance requires financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets.  The amended guidance also requires us to consider historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount in estimating credit losses.  The amended guidance becomes effective for us commencing in 2021 and will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted.   We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Investments:   In March 2016, amended guidance was issued to simplify the transition to the equity method of accounting.  This standard eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method, an investor must restate its historical financial statements, as if the equity method had been used during all previous periods.  Additionally, at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method, any unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized through earnings.  The amended guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Derivatives and Hedging:   In March 2016, amended guidance was issued for derivative instrument novations.  The amendments clarify that a novation, a change in the counterparty, to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationships provided all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2018. The amended guidance allows for either prospective or modified retrospective adoption.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Leases:   In February 2016, amended guidance was issued for lease arrangements.  The amended standard will require recognition on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2020, on a modified retrospective basis.  Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Financial Instruments:   In January 2016, amended guidance was issued that requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income and enhanced disclosures about those investments.  This guidance also simplifies the impairment assessments of equity investments without readily determinable fair value.  The investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or result in consolidation of the investee are excluded from the scope of this amended guidance.  The amended guidance will become effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 and will be adopted through a cumulative-effect adjustment.  Early adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Inventory:    In July 2015, amended guidance was issued for the subsequent measurement of inventory.  The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation.  Accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail method.  The amended guidance will become effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:    In May 2014, amended guidance was issued for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  The amended guidance eliminates industry specific guidance and applies to all companies.  Revenues will be recognized when an entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled for that good or service.  Revenue from a contract that contains multiple performance obligations is allocated to each performance obligation generally on a relative standalone selling price basis.  The amended guidance also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  In March 2016, amended guidance was issued to clarify implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, additional amended guidance was issued to permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the good.  The April 2016 amendment also provided clarifications on determining whether a promised license provides a customer with a right to use or a right to access an entity s intellectual property.  In May 2016, another amendment was issued to provide certain scope improvements and practical expedients.  The May 2016 amendment clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectibility threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.  These amended standards are all effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 and allow for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption.  Early adoption is permitted but not prior to our first quarter of 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  2.    Proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange 
    
  On June 28, 2016, McKesson entered into a contribution agreement as well as various other agreements ( Agreements ) with Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. ( Change Healthcare ), a Delaware corporation, and others to form a joint venture ( JV ).  Under the terms of the Agreements, McKesson will contribute the majority of its McKesson Technology Solutions businesses ( Core MTS Business ) to the JV. McKesson will retain its RelayHealth Pharmacy and Enterprise Information Solutions ( EIS ) businesses.  Change Healthcare will contribute substantially all of its businesses to the JV excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses.  The purpose of the JV is to create a new healthcare information technology company, which will bring together the complementary strengths of the Core MTS Business and Change Healthcare to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care.  
    
  The completion of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including antitrust clearance.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2017.  Upon formation of the JV, McKesson and Change Healthcare shareholders are expected to own approximately   70%   and   30%   of the JV.  The JV will be jointly governed by McKesson and Change Healthcare shareholders.  The Company refers to the foregoing transaction as  Healthcare Technology Net Assets Exchange .  McKesson and Change Healthcare have agreed that they will take steps to launch an initial public offering of an entity holding equity in the JV in the months following the close of the transaction, subject to market conditions. Thereafter, McKesson expects to exit its investment in the JV in a transaction that is intended  to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    
  During the second quarter and first half of 2017, we recorded   $21 million   and   $25 million   of expenses associated with this proposed transaction, which are primarily recorded in Operating Expenses within our Technology Solutions segment in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
       
  In connection with the transaction, the JV has received commitments from certain banks for   $6.1 billion   of long-term debt financing. The proceeds are expected to be utilized for the repayment of the existing debt of Change Healthcare, cash distributions to Change Healthcare shareholders and McKesson and reimbursements of the transaction-related expenses incurred by McKesson and Change Healthcare.  
    
    Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale 
    
  During the second quarter of 2017, the assets and liabilities of the Core MTS Business to be contributed to the JV met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.  The net asset exchange transaction does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation as it does not constitute a significant strategic business shift.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2016,   $1.8 billion   of assets and   $0.6 billion   of liabilities related to the Core MTS Business are included in  Current assets held for sale  and  Current liabilities held for sale  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

3.    Goodwill Impairment 
    
    In conjunction with the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, we are evaluating strategic options for our EIS business, which is a reporting unit within our McKesson Technology Solutions segment.  During the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   (  $282 million   after-tax) to impair the carrying value of this business  goodwill.  Most of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for income tax purposes.  The impairment primarily resulted from a decline in estimated cash flows.   
    
  The goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets, to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  The impairment charge was then determined by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its implied fair value.  As of September 30, 2016, the valuation of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit used to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill was not complete.  As a result, the recorded impairment charge is provisional and subject to further adjustments as we finalize our fair value assessments in the third quarter of 2017.  At September 30, 2016, the remaining goodwill balance for this reporting unit was   $124 million  .  Refer to Financial Note 15,  Fair Value Measurements,  for more information on this nonrecurring fair value measurement.  

4.    Business Combinations 
    
  During the first half of 2017, we completed our acquisitions of Vantage Oncology Holdings LLC ( Vantage ), Biologics, Inc. ( Biologics ), UDG Healthcare Plc ( UDG ) and J Sainsbury Plc ( Sainsbury ), as further discussed below.  
    
  In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted the amended accounting guidance for an acquirer s accounting for measurement period adjustments.  Accordingly, as required, we now recognize all measurement period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined.  
  Vantage   Biologics 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we acquired Vantage, which is headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California.  Vantage provides comprehensive oncology management services, including radiation oncology, medical oncology, and other integrated cancer care services, through over   51   cancer treatment facilities in   13   states.  The net purchase consideration of   $515 million   was funded from cash on hand.  On April 1, 2016, we also acquired Biologics for net purchase consideration of   $692 million  , which was funded from cash on hand.  Biologics is one of the largest independent oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the U.S., and is headquartered in Cary, North Carolina.  Financial results for these acquisitions since the acquisition date are included in our results of operations within our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment.  These acquisitions collectively enhance our specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale and oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, provide solutions for manufacturers and payers, and expand the scope of our community-based oncology and practice management services.

The following table summarizes the preliminary recording of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for these two acquisitions as of the acquisition date: 

During the second quarter of 2017, we recorded certain measurement period adjustments to the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including the fair value of acquired intangible assets. The amounts as of the acquisition date are provisional and subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.  
  At September 30, 2016, approximately   $512 million   and   $566 million   of the adjusted preliminary purchase price allocations for Vantage and Biologics have been assigned to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits of synergies upon integrating the businesses. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and the fair value of noncontrolling interests over the fair value of the acquired net assets.  Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
  Included in the adjusted preliminary purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of   $15 million   and   $193 million   for Vantage and Biologics.  Acquired intangibles for Vantage primarily consist of   $7 million   of non-competition agreements with a weighted average life of   4 years  , and for Biologics primarily consist of   $170 million   of trade names with a weighted average life of   9 years  .  The adjusted preliminary fair value of Vantage s noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date was approximately   $89 million  , which represents the portion of net assets of Vantage s consolidated entities that is not allocable to McKesson.   
  UDG  
    
  On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of the pharmaceutical distribution businesses of UDG based in Ireland and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) with a net purchase consideration of    380 million   (or, approximately   $431 million  ), which was funded with cash on hand.  The acquired UDG businesses primarily provide pharmaceutical and other healthcare products to retail and hospital pharmacies.  The acquisition of UDG expands our offerings and strengthens our market position in Ireland and the U.K.  Financial results for UDG since the acquisition date are included in our results of operations within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment.

During the second quarter of 2017, we recorded certain measurement period adjustments to the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.  The net effect of the current period adjustments was an increase in goodwill of approximately   $20 million   from the provisional amounts as previously reported at June 30, 2016.  Goodwill reflects the expected future benefits of synergies upon integrating the businesses.  Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  At September 30, 2016, the adjusted preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, excluding goodwill and intangibles, were   $473 million   and   $342 million  .  Included in the adjusted preliminary purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of   $115 million   primarily representing customer relationships with a weighted average life of   10 years  .  The amounts as of the acquisition date are provisional and subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.  
    
  Sainsbury  
  On August 31, 2016, we completed our acquisition of the pharmacy business of Sainsbury based in the U.K. with a net purchase consideration of    125 million   (or, approximately   $164 million  ).  This acquisition further enhances our retail pharmacy service capabilities in the U.K.  Financial results for Sainsbury since the acquisition date are included in our results of operations within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment. 
  Under the terms of the agreement, on February 29, 2016, we made an advance cash payment of    125 million   (or, approximately   $174 million  ) representing the full purchase consideration, which was included in  Other Noncurrent Assets  within our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.  The advance payment bore interest at an annual rate of   3.3%  , compounded daily, from February 29, 2016 until the acquisition date.  Upon the completion of the acquisition, we received an interest payment.  
  Total provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, excluding goodwill and intangibles, was   $30 million   and   $10 million   as of the acquisition date.  Goodwill reflects the expected future benefits of synergies upon integrating the businesses.  Included in the preliminary purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of   $65 million   primarily representing restrictive pharmacy licenses with a weighted average life of   15   years.  The amounts as of the acquisition date are provisional and subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized.     
  The fair value of acquired intangibles for Vantage, Biologics, UDG, and Sainsbury was primarily determined by applying the income approach, using several significant unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate.  These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.  
    
  Rexall Health and Other Acquisitions 
    
  In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Rexall Health from the Katz Group Canada, Inc. for   $3 billion   Canadian dollars (or, approximately   $2.3 billion   U.S. dollars using the currency exchange ratio of   0.76   Canadian dollar to 1 U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2016).  Rexall Health, which operates approximately   470   retail pharmacies in Canada, particularly in Ontario and Western Canada, will enhance our Canadian pharmaceutical supply chain.  The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close during the second half of calendar year 2016.  Upon closing, financial results of the acquired business will be included in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business within our Distribution Solutions segment. 
  During the last two years, we also completed a number of other acquisitions within both of our operating segments.  Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates.  Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.   
  Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes.  
   
  5.    Discontinued Operations 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business, which we acquired through our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio, from our Distribution Solutions segment. Accordingly, the results of operations and cash flows of this business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  McKESSON CORPORATION 
  FINANCIAL NOTES (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

On January 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business to a third party. On May 31, 2016, we completed the sale of this business and recognized an after-tax loss of   $113 million   within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2017 primarily for the settlement of certain indemnification matters as well as the release of the cumulative translation losses.  We made a payment of approximately   $100 million   related to the sale of this business.  
  The results of discontinued operations during the second quarters and first six months of 2017 and 2016 were not material except for the loss recognized upon the disposition of our Brazilian business.  As of March 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of total assets and liabilities for this business were   $635 million   and   $660 million  , included under the captions  Current assets held for sale  and  Current liabilities held for sale  within our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
   
  6.  Restructuring 
    
  On March 14, 2016, we committed to a restructuring plan to lower our operating costs (the  Cost Alignment Plan ).  The Cost Alignment Plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce, and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019.  Business process initiatives primarily include plans to reduce operating costs of our distribution and pharmacy operations, administrative support functions, and technology platforms, as well as the disposal and abandonment of certain non-core businesses.  As a result, we recorded   $229 million   of pre-tax charges during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The restructuring liabilities were   $222 million   at March 31, 2016.  
    
  During the second quarter and first six months of 2017, we recorded a pre-tax credit of   $10 million   and   $1 million   as part of the Cost Alignment Plan, and we made   $26 million   and   $71 million   of cash payments, primarily related to severance.  At September 30, 2016, the restructuring liabilities of   $130 million   include   $89 million   recorded in other accrued liabilities and   $41 million   recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  
    
  Under the Cost Alignment Plan, we expect to record total pre-tax charges of approximately   $260 million   to   $280 million  , of which   $228 million   of pre-tax charges have been recorded to date.  Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are largely attributed to our Distribution Solutions segment. 
   
           7. 
    Divestiture of Businesses 
     In August 2015, we sold our ZEE Medical business within our Distribution Solutions segment for a total purchase price of   $134 million  .  We recorded a pre-tax gain from this sale of   $52 million   (  $33 million   after-tax) during the second quarter of 2016  and   $52 million   (  $29 million   after-tax) during the first six months of 2016.  
  During the first quarter of 2016, we sold our nurse triage business within our Technology Solutions segment for net sale proceeds of   $84 million   and recorded a pre-tax gain of   $51 million   (  $38 million   after-tax) from the sale.   
  These divestitures did not meet the criteria to qualify as a discontinued operation under the amended guidance, which became effective for us in the first quarter of 2016.  Accordingly, pre-tax gains from both divestitures were recorded in operating expenses within continuing operations of our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  Other than the gain on disposal, pre and after-tax income for these businesses were not material for the quarters and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

8.    Income Taxes  
    
  During the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, income tax expense related to continuing operations was   $200 million   and   $244 million   and included net discrete tax benefits of   $22 million   and   $24 million  .  During the first six months of 2017 and 2016, income tax expense related to continuing operations was   $439 million   and   $500 million   and included net discrete tax benefits of   $57 million   and   $29 million  .  Our discrete tax benefits for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 include tax benefits of   $9 million   and   $46 million   related to the adoption of the amended accounting guidance on employee share-based compensation.   
  During the second quarter of 2016, we evaluated the recent U.S. Tax Court s decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of share-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing agreement and recognized a discrete tax benefit of   $25 million  . 
  The income tax provision for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 also includes a tax benefit of   $8 million   related to the non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment.  Approximately   $269 million   of the total goodwill impairment charge was not tax deductible.  
  Our reported income tax rates for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were   38.1%   and   27.7%   and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were   30.5%   and   28.8%  .  The fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, the impact of the nondeductible impairment charge and discrete items. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $424 million   of unrecognized tax benefits, of which   $284 million   would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate, if recognized.  Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.  However, this may change as we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year. 
  We report interest and penalties on tax deficiencies as income tax expense.  We recognized income tax benefit of   $8 million   and income tax expense of   $1 million   during the second quarters of 2017 and 2016; and income tax benefit of   $11 million   and income tax expense of   $5 million   during the first six months of 2017 and 2016, before any tax benefit, related to interest and penalties in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, before any tax benefits, our accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits amounted to   $41 million   and   $75 million  . 
  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions.  During the first quarter of 2017, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to settle all outstanding issues relating to the fiscal years 2007 through 2009.  This settlement did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes.  We are subject to audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2010 through the current fiscal year. We are generally subject to audit by taxing authorities in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2006 through the current fiscal year. 
   
  9.  Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the  Domination Agreement ) entered into between McKesson and Celesio AG ( Celesio ) in 2014, McKesson is obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of    0.83   per Celesio share ( Compensation Amount ) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio.  Additionally, the noncontrolling interests in Celesio are redeemable at the option of the holder as a result of a right to put their Celesio shares at    22.99   per share ( Put Right ) under the Domination Agreement.  Accordingly, the noncontrolling interests in Celesio are presented as  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests  on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The Put Right amount is increased annually for interest in the amount of   five   percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any Compensation Amount or the guaranteed dividend already paid in respect of the relevant time period ( Put Amount ).  The Domination Agreement became effective when it was registered in the commercial register of Celesio at the local court of Stuttgart on December 2, 2014.

     Table of Contents  
  McKESSON CORPORATION 
  FINANCIAL NOTES (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Subsequent to the Domination Agreement s registration, certain noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio initiated appraisal proceedings ( Appraisal Proceedings ) with the Stuttgart Regional Court to challenge the Compensation Amount, the guaranteed dividend and/or the Put Amount.  If any such Appraisal Proceedings result in an adjustment to the Compensation Amount, the guaranteed dividend and/or the Put Amount, Celesio Holdings Deutschland GmbH   Co. KGaA (formerly known as McKesson Deutschland GmbH   Co. KGaA or Dragonfly GmbH   Co. KGaA) would be required to make certain additional payments for any shortfall to all Celesio noncontrolling shareholders who previously received the guaranteed dividend, Compensation Amount and/or the Put Amount.  
  The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date.  The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period.  There were   no   material exercises of the Put Right during the second quarter and first six months of 2017.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests of   $1.34 billion   and   $1.41 billion   exceeded the maximum redemption value of   $1.26 billion   and   $1.28 billion  .  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we owned approximately   76.0%   of Celesio s outstanding common shares. 
  Changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests were as follows: 

There were no material changes in our ownership interests of noncontrolling interests during the first six months of 2017 and 2016. 
   
  10.    Earnings Per Common Share 
    
  Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.  Diluted earnings per common share are computed similar to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

The computations for basic and diluted earnings per common share are as follows: 

(1) 
    Certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
     Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance-based and other restricted stock units.  Approximately   2 million   and   1 million   potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computations of diluted net earnings per common share for each of the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   2 million   and   1 million   potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computations of diluted net earnings per common share for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as they were anti-dilutive.

    Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net  
     Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the accumulated goodwill impairment losses were   $290 million   and   $36 million   primarily in our Technology Solutions segment.  Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 3,  Proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange  and  Goodwill Impairment,  for more information on goodwill reclassified to assets held for sale and the impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of 2017.  
  Information regarding intangible assets is as follows: 

Amortization expense of intangible assets was   $115 million   and   $230 million   for the quarter and six months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $109 million   and   $221 million   for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2015.  Estimated annual amortization expense of these assets is as follows:   $181 million  ,   $369 million  ,   $350 million  ,   $325 million   and   $298 million   for the remainder of 2017 and each of the succeeding years through 2021 and   $1,538 million   thereafter.  All intangible assets were subject to amortization as of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  .

    Debt and Financing Activities 
     Long-Term Debt 
  Our long-term debt includes both U.S. dollar and foreign currency (primarily Euro) denominated borrowings.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016,   $8,107 million   of total long-term debt was outstanding, of which   $2,166 million   and   $1,610 million   were included under the caption  Current portion of long-term debt  within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  On October 18, 2016, we repaid    350 million   of a Euro-denominated bond (or, approximately   $385 million  ) at its maturity. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we repaid   $400 million   of floating rate notes at maturity. 
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  We have a syndicated   $3.5 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Global Facility ), which has a   $3.15 billion   aggregate sublimit of availability in Canadian dollars, British pound sterling and Euros.  The Global facility matures on October 22, 2020.  Borrowings under the Global Facility bear interest based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate, Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, a prime rate, or alternative overnight rates as applicable, and agreed margins.  The Global Facility contains a financial covenant which obligates the Company to maintain a debt to capital ratio of no greater than   65%   and other customary investment grade covenants.  If we do not comply with these covenants, our ability to use the Global Facility may be suspended and repayment of any outstanding balances under the Global Facility may be required.  At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants.  There were   no   borrowings outstanding under this facility during the second quarter and first six months of 2017, and as of September 30, 2016.   
  We also maintain bilateral credit lines primarily denominated in Euros with a total committed and uncommitted balance of   $339 million  .  Borrowings and repayments were not material during the first six months of 2017.  During the first six months of 2016, we borrowed   $618 million   and repaid   $616 million   under these credit lines primarily related to short-term borrowings.  These credit lines have interest rates ranging from   0.18%   to   2.75%   plus the relevant floating reference rate.  As of September 30, 2016, there was   no   amount outstanding under bilateral credit lines.  
  Accounts Receivable Facilities 
  We previously maintained accounts receivable factoring facilities (the  Factoring Facilities ) denominated in foreign currencies.  During the first six months of 2017 and 2016, we borrowed   $6 million   and   $883 million   and repaid   $13 million   and   $887 million   in short-term borrowings under these facilities.  The Factoring Facilities expired in April 2016.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, there were   nil   and   $7 million   in secured borrowings outstanding under these facilities.   
  Commercial Paper 
  We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes.  Under the program, the Company can issue up to   $3.5 billion   in outstanding notes.  There were   no   material commercial paper issuances during the first six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and   no   amounts outstanding at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  
   
  13.    Pension Benefits 
    
  The net periodic expense for our defined pension benefit plans was   $8 million   and   $14 million   for the second quarter and  first six months of 2017 and   $18 million   and   $31 million   for the second quarter and first six months of 2016. 
    
  Cash contributions to these plans were   $6 million   and   $10 million   for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and   $10 million   and   $44 million   for the second quarter and first six months of 2016.  The projected unit credit method is utilized in measuring net periodic pension expense over the employees  service life for the pension plans.  Unrecognized actuarial losses exceeding   10%   of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized straight-line over the average remaining future service periods and expected life expectancy.

  FINANCIAL NOTES (CONTINUED) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  At times, we limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts.  In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes.  We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.   
  Foreign currency exchange risk 
  We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars.  We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.  We have certain foreign currency exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps.  These forward contracts and cross currency swaps are generally used to offset the potential income statement effects from intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.  These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange rate risk. 
  Derivatives Designated as Hedges 
  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had forward contracts to hedge the U.S. dollar against cash flows denominated in Canadian dollars with total gross notional values of   $323 million  , which were designated as cash flow hedges.  These contracts will mature between   March 2017   and   March 2020  .   
  From time to time, we enter into cross currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated borrowings to fixed-rate U.S. dollar borrowings.  For our cross currency swap transactions, we agree with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, one currency for another currency at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to agreed upon notional amounts.  These cross currency swaps are designed to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges.   
  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had cross currency swaps with total gross notional amounts of approximately   $1,011 million   and   $546 million  , which are designated as cash flow hedges.  These swaps will mature between February 2018 and April 2020.  
  For forward contracts and currency swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair values of hedges is recorded into accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Changes in fair values representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.  Gains or losses on these hedges recorded in other comprehensive income and earnings were not material during the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 
  We also have a number of forward contracts to primarily hedge the Euro against cash flows denominated in British pound sterling and other European currencies.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the total gross notional amounts of these contracts were   $143 million   and   $876 million  .   
  These contracts will mature through   December 2016   and none of these contracts were designated for hedge accounting.  Changes in the fair values of contracts not designated as hedges are recorded directly into earnings and accordingly, net gains of   $3 million   and   $5 million   for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and net gains of   $67 million   and   $22 million   for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 were recorded within operating expenses.  The gains or losses from these contracts are largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying intercompany foreign currency loans.

Information regarding the fair value of derivatives on a gross basis is as follows: 

Refer to Financial Note 15, "Fair Value Measurements," for more information on these recurring fair value measurements.  
   
  15.     Fair Value Measurements 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the carrying amounts of cash, certain cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.   
  Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost.  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these liabilities were   $8.1 billion   and   $8.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $8.1 billion   and   $8.6 billion   at   March 31, 2016  .  The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was determined using quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  Included in cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016   were investments in money market funds, time deposits, bankers  acceptances and foreign government debentures of   $3.4 billion   and   $2.4 billion  , which are reported at fair value. The fair value of the money market funds was determined by using quoted prices for identical investments in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.  The time deposits, bankers  acceptances and foreign government debentures included in the cash equivalents are valued at amortized costs or other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs.  The carrying value of all other cash equivalents approximates their fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.

Fair values of our forward foreign currency derivatives were determined using quoted market prices of similar instruments in an active market and other observable inputs from available market information.  Fair values of our foreign currency swaps were determined using the quoted foreign currency exchange rates and other observable inputs from available market information.  These inputs are considered Level 2 under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.  Refer to Financial Note 14, "Hedging Activities," for more information on our forward foreign currency derivatives including foreign currency forward contracts and swaps. 
  There were   no   transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the quarters and six months ended September 30,   2016   and   2015  . 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  We measure certain long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, our intent to hold the investment, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the financial outlook for the industry and location. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of goodwill for a reporting unit within our Technology Solutions segment, as further discussed below. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2016. 
    
  There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2016.

  As discussed in Financial Note 3, "Goodwill Impairment," during the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   (  $282 million   after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business, which is a  reporting unit within our Technology Solution segment.  The impairment primarily resulted from a decline in estimated cash flows.  The goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets, to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. 
    
  Fair value assessment of the reporting unit and the reporting unit's net assets are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. We considered the market approach as well as income approach using a discount cash flow ( DCF ) model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The DCF method was used to determine the fair value of intangible assets. 

16.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
    
  In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business.  As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages. 
  When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.  However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency.  Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.  When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.

Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision.  We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made.  As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties.  Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates. 
  Significant developments in previously reported proceedings and in other litigation and claims, since the filing of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 are set out below.  Unless otherwise stated, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings described below.  Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
  Litigation, Government Subpoenas and Investigations  
  As previously disclosed, in July 2015, True Health Chiropractic and McLaughlin Chiropractic Associates filed a motion for class certification purportedly on behalf of all persons who were sent marketing faxes that did not contain proper opt-out notices and from whom the Company and McKesson Technologies Inc. did not obtain prior express permission from June 2009 to the present in alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ( TCPA ), as amended by the Junk Fax Protection Act of 2005.  On August 22, 2016, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied Plaintiffs  motion.  On September 6, 2016, Plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On September 20, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings until the appeal has been resolved.  Neither court has ruled on Plaintiffs  motions.  
  From time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies.  The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner.  These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company.  Such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to settlements.  Examples of such subpoenas and investigations are included in the Company s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and previously filed Form 10-Qs. 
   
  17.    Stockholders  Equity 
    
  Each share of the Company s outstanding common stock is permitted   one   vote on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ).   
  In July 2015, the Company s quarterly dividend was raised from   $0.24   to   $0.28   per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company's future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 
  Share Repurchase Plans 
    
  During the second quarter and first six months of 2017, there were   no   share repurchases.  The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company s common stock was   $1.0 billion   at September 30, 2016.   
  In October 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $4 billion   of the Company s common stock.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  Information regarding other comprehensive income (loss) including redeemable noncontrolling interests, net of tax, by component is as follows:   

(1) 
    Foreign currency translation adjustments result from the conversion of non-U.S. dollar financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the Company s reporting currency, U.S. dollars, and were primarily related to our foreign subsidiary, Celesio, during the second quarters and first six months of 2017 and 2016. 
              (2) 
    The net foreign currency translation losses during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar from April 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016.  During the second quarter of 2016, the currency translation losses were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar from July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015.  The net foreign currency translation gains during the first six months of 2016 were primarily due to the recovery of the Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar from April 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015. 
              (3) 
    The second quarter and first six months of 2017 include net foreign currency translation gains of   $1 million   and losses of   $66 million   and the second quarter and first six months of 2016 include net foreign translation losses of   $20 million   and gains of   $30 million  , which are attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. 
              (4) 
    The first six months of 2017 includes net foreign currency translation losses of   $20 million   reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, within our condensed consolidated statements of operations due to the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.  
              (5) 
    The second quarter and first six months of 2017 include net actuarial losses of   nil   and   $1 million   and the second quarter and first six months of 2016 include net actuarial losses of   nil   and   $6 million  , which are attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.

    Segment Information 
     We report our operations in   two   operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions.  The factors for determining the reportable segments included the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities.  We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations. 
  Financial information relating to our reportable operating segments and reconciliations to the condensed consolidated totals is as follows:  

(1) 
    Revenues derived from services represent less than   2%   of this segment s total revenues. 
              (2) 
    Distribution Solutions operating profit for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 include pre-tax credits of   $43 million   and pre-tax charges of   $4 million   related to our last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method of accounting for inventories.  The second quarter and first six months of 2016 include pre-tax LIFO charges of $  91 million   and   $182 million  .  LIFO expense decreased in 2017 primarily due to the lower full year expectations for price increases. 
              (3) 
    The second quarter of 2016 includes a pre-tax gain of   $52 million   recognized from the sale of our ZEE Medical business, and the first six months of 2017 and 2016 include   $142 million   and   $59 million   of net cash proceeds representing our share of net settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits against drug manufacturers.  
              (4) 
    Technology Solutions operating profit for the first six months of 2016 includes a pre-tax gain of   $51 million   recognized from the 2016 first quarter sale of our nurse triage business. 
              (5) 
    The second quarter and first six months of 2017 include a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   for goodwill impairment related to the EIS reporting unit within our Technology Solutions segment.

Results of Operations 
  Overview: 

Revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to market growth, higher revenues associated with our 2017 acquisitions including Vantage Oncology Holdings LLC ( Vantage ), Biologics, Inc. ( Biologics ) and UDG Healthcare Plc ( UDG ), and expanded business with existing customers within our North America pharmaceutical distribution businesses.  These increases were partially offset by customer losses.  Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion.  Additionally, our Distribution Solutions segment is experiencing customer consolidation, including business combinations that impact our customers.   
  Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2017 decreased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends, the competitive pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business.  These decreases were partially offset by our acquisitions, benefits from our global procurement arrangements and lower last-in-first out ( LIFO ) inventory charges.  Gross profit for 2017 also reflects the impact of previously announced customer consolidation activity.  Additionally, gross profit for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 included   $142 million   and   $59 million   of cash receipts for our share of antitrust legal settlements.  For the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, LIFO inventory adjustments were a credit of   $43 million   and an expense of   $91 million  , and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, expenses of   $4 million   and   $182 million  .  LIFO expense decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower full year expectations for price increases.

Operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to our acquisitions, partially offset by cost savings from a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, our ongoing expense management efforts and favorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 also included a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   (  $282 million   after-tax) for goodwill impairment related to our Enterprise Information Solutions ( EIS ) business within our Technology Solutions segment, as further discussed below.  Operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 also benefited from pre-tax gains of $52 million and $103 million from the sale of two businesses. 
  Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses.  
  Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 was   $307 million   and $  617 million   and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was   $849 million   and   $1,193 million  .  Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were   $1.34   and $  2.63   and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were   $3.72   and   $5.08  .  Net income for the first six months of 2017 includes discrete income tax benefits of   $46 million   related to the early adoption of the amended accounting guidance on share-based compensation as well as an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of   $113 million  , or $0.50 per diluted share, resulting from the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business. 
  On June 28, 2016, McKesson entered into a contribution agreement as well as various other agreements (the  Agreements ) with Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. ( Change Healthcare ) and others to form a joint venture ( JV ).  Under the terms of the Agreements, McKesson will contribute the majority of its McKesson Technology Solutions businesses ( Core MTS Business ) to the JV. McKesson will retain its RelayHealth Pharmacy and EIS businesses.  Change Healthcare will contribute substantially all of its businesses to the JV excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses.   The purpose of the JV is to create a new healthcare information technology company, which will bring together the complementary strengths of the Core MTS Business and Change Healthcare to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs, improve patient access and outcomes, and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care.   
  The completion of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including antitrust clearance.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2017.  Upon formation of the JV, McKesson and Change Healthcare shareholders are expected to own approximately 70% and 30% of the JV.  The JV will be jointly governed by McKesson and Change Healthcare shareholders.  The Company refers to the foregoing transaction as  Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange .   
  During the second quarter of 2017, the assets and liabilities of the Core MTS Business to be contributed to the JV met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.  The proposed net asset exchange transaction does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation as it does not constitute a significant strategic business shift.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2016,   $1.8 billion   of assets and   $0.6 billion   of liabilities related to the Core MTS Business are included in  Current assets held for sale  and  Current liabilities held for sale  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. We expect to recognize a gain upon the closing of the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  
  Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 3,  Proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange  and  Goodwill Impairment,  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
    
  In conjunction with the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, we are evaluating strategic options for our EIS business, which is a reporting unit within our McKesson Technology Solutions segment.  During the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   (  $282 million   after-tax) to impair the carrying value of this business  goodwill.  Most of the goodwill impairment is not deductible for income tax purposes.  The impairment primarily resulted from a decline in estimated cash flows.  The goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets, to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  The impairment charge was then determined by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its implied fair value.  As of September 30, 2016, the valuation of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit used to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill was not complete.  As a result, the recorded impairment charge is provisional and subject to further adjustments as we finalize our fair value assessments in the third quarter of 2017.

Revenues: 

Revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased   2  % and   4  % compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately   99  % of our consolidated revenues.  
  Distribution Solutions 
  North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased primarily due to market growth, increased sales associated with our acquisitions including Vantage and Biologics and expanded business with existing customers.  These increases were partially offset by customer losses.  
  International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased   7  % and   8  % primarily due to our acquisitions including UDG and market growth.  International revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5% and 3% for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 primarily reflecting a decline in the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar.  
  Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 primarily due to market growth and a smaller acquisition, partially offset by lower revenues associated with the sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of 2016. 
  Our Distribution Solutions segment is experiencing customer consolidation, including business combinations that impact our customers.  
  Technology Solutions:   Technology Solutions revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, the transition of our workforce business within our International Technology business to a third party and the sale of a small business in the fourth quarter of 2016.  This segment s revenues for the first six months of 2017 were also unfavorably affected by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter of 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in our other businesses.

Gross Profit: 

bp - basis points 
  Gross profit and gross profit margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to a decline in our Distribution Solutions segment. 
  Distribution Solutions 
  Distribution Solutions segment s gross profit and gross profit margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods a year ago due to weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends, the competitive pricing environment and  lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. These decreases were partially offset by our acquisitions, benefits from our global procurement arrangements and lower LIFO inventory charges.  Gross profit for 2017 also reflects the impact of previously announced customer consolidation activity.  Additionally, gross profit for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 included   $142 million   and   $59 million   of cash receipts for our share of antitrust legal settlements.  For the second quarters of 2017 and 2016,  LIFO inventory adjustments were a credit of   $43 million   and an expense of   $91 million  ,  and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, expenses of   $4 million   and   $182 million  .   
  Our North America distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business  practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity.  A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our quarterly LIFO expense or credit is determined based on our estimates of annual LIFO expense which is impacted by expected changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external influences.  Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO expense.  The actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is calculated at the end of the fiscal year.  As a result of a change in estimate of branded price increases during the second quarter of 2017, we revised our full year estimate of our LIFO expense.  Our full year LIFO expense is anticipated to be lower than the prior year primarily due to lower price increases.  LIFO expense decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower full year expectations for price increases.  
  Technology Solutions 
  Technology Solutions segment s gross profit and gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2017 decreased compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to a decline in revenues and our product mix.  Gross profit for the first six months of 2017 increased primarily due to lower severance charges and higher pull through of deferred revenue, partially offset by the prior year sale of our nurse triage business.  Gross profit margin for the first six months of 2017 increased primarily due to lower severance charges, higher pull through of deferred revenue and the sale of our nurse triage business.  In the first six months of 2016, this segment recorded a $20 million severance charge associated with the wind down of a product line. The severance charge was recorded as follows: $15 million in cost of sales and $5 million in operating expenses.

Operating Expenses and Other Income, Net:    

Operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased   15  % and   8  % compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to our acquisitions, partially offset by cost savings from a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016, our ongoing expense management efforts and favorable foreign currency effects. Additionally, operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 include a non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   (  $282 million   after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment.  Operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 include pre-tax gains of $52 million and $103 million from the sale of two businesses. 
  On March 14, 2016, we committed to a restructuring plan to lower our operating costs (the  Cost Alignment Plan ).  The Cost Alignment Plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019.  Business process initiatives primarily include plans to reduce operating costs of our distribution and pharmacy operations, administrative support functions and technology platforms, as well as the disposal or abandonment of certain non-core businesses.  
  The Cost Alignment Plan is expected to incur a total of   $260 million   to   $280 million   of pre-tax charges, of which   $229 million   was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily representing severance and employee-related costs.  During the second quarter and first six months of 2017, we recorded a pre-tax credit of   $10 million   and   $1 million  .  Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are largely attributed to our Distribution Solutions segment.  We anticipate the Cost Alignment Plan to generate approximately $170 million to $190 million of net pre-tax savings during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 and an incremental $70 million to $90 million of net pre-tax savings in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.   This cumulative run rate of savings is expected to benefit the company in future years.  Our operating expenses benefited from the Cost Alignment Plan beginning the first quarter of 2017. 
  Distribution Solutions 
    
  Distribution Solutions segment s operating expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 were flat compared to the same periods a year ago primarily as increases associated with our acquisitions were fully offset by cost savings from the Cost Alignment Plan including lower compensation and benefit costs, our ongoing expense management efforts and favorable foreign currency effects of approximately 2% to 3%.  Additionally, operating expenses for 2016 benefited from a $52 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our ZEE Medical business.

Technology Solutions 
    
  Technology Solutions segment s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 increased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of   $290 million  , transaction expenses incurred in relation to the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange and severance charges.  Additionally, operating expenses for the first six months of 2016 included a pre-tax gain of   $51 million   from the sale of our nurse triage business.  These increases were partially offset by cost savings from the Cost Alignment Plan and our ongoing expense management efforts.

  Corporate expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to cost savings from the Cost Alignment Plan including lower compensation and benefit costs and outside service fees.  
  Acquisition Expenses and Related Adjustments 
  Acquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions and the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, were   $40 million   and $  33 million   in the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 and   $90 million   and   $63 million   in the first six months of 2017 and 2016.  These expenses primarily include consulting fees, employee severance and retention incentives and legal fees.  Increases in the acquisition-related  expenses were primarily due to the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange and our current year acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in expenses associated with our February 2013 acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc. ( PSSI ).  Our integration of PSSI was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2017.

  Segment Operating Profit 
    
  Distribution Solutions:    Operating profit and operating profit margin decreased for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to lower gross profit.

  Technology Solutions:    Operating profit and operating profit margin decreased for the second quarter and first six months of  2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to higher operating expenses including a   $290 million   pre-tax charge for goodwill impairment related to our EIS business.  Additionally, operating profit for the first six months of 2016 included a $51 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our nurse triage business.

Interest Expense:    Interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 decreased primarily due to repayments of debt and certain foreign currency denominated credit facilities. 
  Income Taxes:    Our reported income tax rates for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 were   38.1%   and   27.7%   and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were   30.5%   and   28.8%  .  The fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, the impact of the nondeductible impairment charge and discrete items. 
  Income tax expense for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 includes net discrete tax benefits of   $22 million   and   $24 million   and for the first six months of 2017 and 2016,   $57 million   and   $29 million  .  Our discrete tax benefits for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 include   $9 million   and   $46 million   tax benefits related to the early adoption of the amended accounting guidance on employee share-based compensation.  Our income tax provision for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 also includes a tax benefit of   $8 million   related to the non-cash pre-tax charge of   $290 million   to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment.  Approximately   $269 million   of the total goodwill impairment charge was not tax deductible.  
  Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax:    Loss from discontinued operations, net for the first six months of 2017 includes an after-tax loss of $113 million from the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.  Loss from discontinued operations, net was   $16 million   for the first six months of 2016. Diluted loss per common share from discontinued operations for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was   $0.50   and   $0.07  . 
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests:    Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2017 primarily represents the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of  0.83 per Celesio share that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the  Domination Agreement ).  Refer to Financial Note 9,  Noncontrolling Interests,  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for additional information. 
  Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation  : Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was   $307 million   and   $617 million  , and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were   $1.34   and   $2.63   for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016.  Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was   $849 million   and   $1,193 million  , and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were   $3.72    and   $5.08   for the first six months of 2017 and 2016.  
  Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding  :     Diluted earnings per common share were calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of   228 million   and   235 million   for the second quarters and first six months of 2017 and 2016.  Weighted average diluted shares for 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily reflecting common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.  In addition, from time to time, we may access the long-term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. 
  Operating activities generated cash of   $2,928 million   and   $1,251 million   during the   first six months of 2017 and 2016  .  Operating activities for the   first six months of 2017   were affected by higher drafts and accounts payable and increases in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth.  Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts and payments to vendors.  Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sale and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. 
  Investing activities utilized cash of   $1,346 million   and   $69 million   during the   first six months of 2017 and 2016  .  Investing activities for the first six months of 2017 include   $2,041 million   of cash paid for acquisitions, of which $935 million was prepaid before March 31, 2016 and was released from restricted cash balances.  Investing activities for 2017 also include a payment of approximately $100 million to sell our Brazilian business.  Investing activities for the first six months of 2016 included $204 million in net proceeds from the sale of businesses. 
  Financing activities utilized cash of   $114 million   and   $1,190 million   during the   first six months of 2017 and 2016  .  Financing activities for the   first six months of 2017   include cash receipts of   $10 million   and payments of   $17 million   for short-term borrowings.  Long-term debt repayments for the   first six months of 2017   were primarily cash paid on certain long-term debt.  Financing activities for the   first six months of 2016   included cash receipts and payments of   $1,501 million   for short-term borrowings.  Long-term debt repayments during the first six months of 2016 were primarily due to the repayment of a $400 million bond.  Additionally, financing activities for the   first six months of 2017 and 2016   included   $58 million   and   $605 million   of cash paid for stock repurchases, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings. 
  The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company s common stock was   $1.0 billion   at September 30, 2016. The Company s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.  During the first six months of 2017, there were no share repurchases. 
  In October 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to   $4 billion   of the Company s common stock. 
  We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that future volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 
   
  Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources 

(1) 
    Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders  equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
              (2) 
    Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders  equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value.  Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in British pound sterling, time deposits, bankers  acceptances, and Canadian government debentures.  
  The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions.  We mitigate the risk of our short term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. 
  Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of   September 30, 2016   included approximately $2.9 billion held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States.  Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations.  Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. 
  Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities.  Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.    
  Our debt to capital ratio decreased in 2017 primarily reflecting higher McKesson stockholders  equity.  
  In July 2015, the Company s quarterly dividend was raised from $0.24 to $0.28 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company's future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. 
  The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Celesio was   $1.34 billion   at September 30, 2016, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of   $1.26 billion  .  The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date.  Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio received a put right that enables them to put their Celesio shares to McKesson at  22.99 per share, the price of which is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid ( Put Amount ).  The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period.  The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain.  Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of  0.83 per Celesio share (the  Compensation Amount ) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period.  Refer to Financial Note 9,   Noncontrolling Interests,  to the condensed  consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  In connection with the proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, the JV has received commitments from certain banks for   $6.1 billion   of long-term debt financing.  The proceeds are expected to be utilized for repayment of the existing debt of Change Healthcare, cash distributions to McKesson and the Change Healthcare shareholders and payments of the transaction-related expenses. Refer to Financial Note 2,  Proposed Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  Credit Resources 
  We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuance.  
  Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions.  Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 12,  Debt and Financing Activities,  to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Each Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Committed Loans, (ii) four Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans.  Each telephonic notice by a Borrower pursuant to this   Section 2.02(a)   must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower.  Each Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Except as provided in   Sections 2.03(c)   and   2.04(c)  , each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the applicable Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) the identity of the Borrower and the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the requested currency of such Borrowing.  If the applicable Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the Committed Loan so requested shall be made in Dollars.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans;   provided  ,   however  , that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Committed Loans denominated in Sterling or Euro, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, they will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  No Committed Loan may be converted to or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Committed Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.

(b)        Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans, or continuation of Committed Loans denominated in Sterling or Euro, in each case described in   Section 2.02(a)  .

  (c)        Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan.  During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether in Dollars or any Alternative Currency) without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. 
  (d)        The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  The determination of the Eurocurrency Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  
  (e)        After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect at any time with respect to Committed Loans.

  (F)        a default of any Lender s obligations to fund under   Section 2.03(c)   exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless (i) the applicable Borrower shall have Cash Collateralized an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the full amount of such Letter of Credit, provided that the Cash Collateral in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share shall be released to such Borrower promptly upon request after the effective date of the replacement of such Lender in accordance with   Section 11.15  , or (ii) the L/C Issuer has otherwise entered into satisfactory arrangements with such Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer s actual or potential Fronting Exposure.

Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;   provided,     however  , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of      clause (ii)   of   Section 2.03(a)   or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the applicable Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   Section 4.03   is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

(c)        Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations  . 
  (i)        Upon receipt from the Beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified the L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that applicable Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than 12:00 noon Local Time on the Business Day following the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time (to be specified by the L/C Issuer to the applicable Borrower prior to such date of payment) on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an    Honor Date   ), such Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.  In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this   Section 2.03(c)(i)   and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the applicable Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing.  If the applicable Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the    Unreimbursed Amount   ), and the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in   Section 2.02   for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in   Section 4.03   (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice).  Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)(i)   may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;   provided     that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
  
    37 

(ii)        Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar denominated payments in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of   Section 2.03(c)(iii)  , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in Dollars. 
  (iii)        With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in   Section 4.03   cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(ii)   shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this   Section 2.03  . 
  (iv)        Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
  (v)        Each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this   2.03(c)  , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided,     however  , that each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 4.03   (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
  
    38 

(vi)        If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.03(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.03(c)(ii)  , the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Repayment of Participations  . 
  (i)        At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with   Section 2.03(c)  , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L/C Advance was outstanding) in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
  (ii)        If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in   Section 11.05   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
  (i)        any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
  
    39 

(ii)        the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such Beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
  (iii)        any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
  (iv)        any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any Beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
  (v)         any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or 
  (vi)        any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
  The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Company s instructions or other irregularity, the Company will immediately notify the L/C Issuer.  Each Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
  
    40 

(f)        Role of L/C Issuer  .  Each Lender and each Borrower agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any Beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;   provided,     however  , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the applicable Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the Beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of   Section 2.03(e)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicable Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to such Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by such Borrower which such Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the Beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
  
    41 

(g)        Cash Collateral  .  Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the applicable Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations.    Sections 2.03(a)(ii)(F)  , 2.05, 2.18(a)(v) and 8.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder.  For purposes of this   Sections 2.03  , 2.05, 2.18  (a)(v)   and   Section 8.02(c)  ,    Cash Collateralize    means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, as applicable, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders).  Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.  Each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.  For purposes of this   Section 2.03  ,    Cash Collateral    means the cash and deposit account balances pledged and deposited with or delivered to the Agent, pursuant to a requirement to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations.  Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
  (h)        Applicability of ISP and UCP  .  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP, with the exception of Rule  5.09 thereof, shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. 
  (i)        Letter of Credit Fees  .  The applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate   times   the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit).  Such letter of credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable on the tenth calendar day following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
  
    42 

(j)        Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer  .  The applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 0.125 % per annum   times   the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with   Section 1.07  .  In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges (including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to issuances, amendments, renewals, extensions and any demands for payment), of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
  (k)        Conflict with Issuer Document  .  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 
  (l)        Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries  .  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit and to make any Cash Collateral deposits required hereunder.  The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Company, and that the Company s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
  (m)        Reports to Administrative Agent  .  The L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, upon each calendar month end, a report setting forth for such period the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under the Letters of Credit that were outstanding during such month. 
  (n)        Designation of L/C Issuer.    The Company may, at any time and from time to time, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, designate as an L/C Issuer one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below.  The acceptance by a Lender of an appointment as an L/C Issuer hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer, executed by each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, as the case may be, (x) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement and (y) references herein to the term  L/C Issuer  shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an issuer of Letters of Credit hereunder. 
  
    43 

(o)        Letter of Credit Reports  .    On (i) the last Business Day of each calendar month, and (ii) each date that an L/C Credit Extension occurs with respect to any Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a written report in the form of   Exhibit K   hereto, appropriately completed with the information for every Letter of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer that is outstanding hereunder.

  (a)        The Swing Line.    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this   Section 2.04  , shall make loans (each such loan, a    Swing Line Loan   ) from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period, to (i) in the case of Bank of America, any Borrower that is a U.S. Person or that is organized under the laws of Canada, which shall consist of Swing Line Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Swing Line Canadian Dollar Sublimit, (ii) in the case of Citibank N.A., any Borrower that is a U.S. Person or that is organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands or any other Designated Borrower Jurisdiction that is a Participating Member State, which shall consist of Swing Line Loans denominated in Euro, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Swing Line Euro Sublimit and (iii) in the case of Barclays Bank PLC, any Borrower that is a U.S. Person or that is organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands or any other Designated Borrower Jurisdiction that is a Participating Member State, which shall consist of Swing Line Loans denominated in Sterling, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Swing Line Sterling Sublimit;   provided  ,   however  , that (x) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (ii) the Total Outstandings denominated in Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit, (iii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lender s Commitment and (iv) in the case of the Lender acting as the Swing Line Lender with respect to such Swing Line Loan (whether directly or through an Affiliate), unless such Lender shall agree otherwise in its sole discretion, such Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure plus (without duplication) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swing Line Loans issued by such Swing Line Lender shall not exceed such Lender s Commitment  ,   (y) the Borrowers shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan, and (z) no Swing Line Lender shall be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this   Section 2.04,   prepay under   Section 2.05  , and reborrow under this   Section 2.04  .  Each Swing Line Loan denominated in (i) Canadian Dollars shall be a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, (ii) Euro shall be a Euro Overnight Rate Loan and (iii) Sterling shall be a Sterling Overnight Rate Loan.  Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan by a Swing Line Lender, each other Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
  
    44 

(b)        Borrowing Procedures.   Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon any Borrower s irrevocable notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone (other than with respect to Swing Line Borrowings denominated in Sterling) or (B) by a Swing Line Loan Notice;   provided   that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swing Line Loan Notice. Each such Swing Line Loan Notice must be received by the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon Local Time on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day.  Promptly after receipt by any Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice, such Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, such Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless such Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing (other than with respect to Swing Line Borrowings denominated in Sterling, in which case such notice must be in writing)) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. Local Time on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing such Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of   Section     2.04  (a)  , or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in ARTICLE IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Swing Line Lender will, not later than 4:00 p.m. Local Time on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the applicable Borrower. 
  (c)        Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. 
  (i)        Each Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably authorizes each Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan (with a one-month Interest Period) in the applicable currency in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of   Section 2.02  , without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in   Section 4.03  .  The applicable Swing Line Lender shall furnish the applicable Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in the applicable currency and in Same Day Funds for the account of such Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office for payments in such currency not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to   Section 2.04(c)(ii)  , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made an Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to such Swing Line Lender.  
  
    45 

(ii)        If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with   Section 2.04(c)(i)  , the request for Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans submitted by such Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by such Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan in the applicable currency and each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Line Lender pursuant to   Section 2.04(c)(i)   shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to such Swing Line Lender. 
  (iii)        If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.04(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.04(c)(i)  , such Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of any Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this   clause (iii)   shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (iv)        Each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.04(c)   shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any Swing Line Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.04(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 4.03  .  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (d)        Repayment of Participations  .   
  (i)        At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the applicable Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender. 
  
    46 

(ii)        If any payment received by any Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by such Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in   Section 11.05   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of such Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender  .  The applicable Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the applicable Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk participation pursuant to this   Section 2.04   to refinance such Lender s Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender. 
  (f)        Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender  .  The applicable Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.  Such payment shall be in Same Day Funds in the applicable Alternative Currency, unless the applicable Swing Line Lender (at its option) shall have specified that it will require payment in Dollars (with any corresponding obligations of the Lenders under   Section 2.04(c)   to be denominated in Dollars and to be made as Base Rate Committed Loan).  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Swing Line Lender shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such payment promptly following the determination thereof.  In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this   Section 2.04(f)   and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the applicable Borrower shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the Swing Line Lender for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing.

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) and currency of Committed Loans to be prepaid.  The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to   Section 3.05  .  Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 
  (b)        If for any reason (other than a change in exchange rates, in which case clause (d) shall apply) the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the applicable Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;   provided,     however  , that the Borrowers shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this   Section 2.05(b)   unless after the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect. 
  (c)        Any Borrower may, upon notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;   provided   that (i) such notice must be received by such Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. Local Time on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by any Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. 
  (d)        (i)    If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment     to an amount not to exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect. 
  
    48 

(ii)      If at any time, solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the Aggregate Commitments, the applicable Borrower shall (x) immediately repay Loans or (y) Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to and within the time period required by   Section 2.03(g)  , in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y) in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount of all Revolving Credit Exposure to be less than or equal to the Aggregate Commitments. 
  (iii)      If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that (x) the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans at such time exceeds the aggregate Swing Line Sublimit and/or (y) that the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency exceeds the Swing Line Canadian Dollar Sublimit, the Swing Line Euro Sublimit or the Swing Line Sterling Sublimit, applicable for such Alternative Currency, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay the applicable Swing Line Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed the Swing Line Sublimit and/or Swing Line Canadian Dollar Sublimit, the Swing Line Euro Sublimit and/or the Swing Line Sterling Sublimit, as applicable.   
   
  2.06        Termination or Reduction of Commitments  .  The Company may, upon notice to the Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments;   provided   that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Foreign Designated Borrower Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such sublimit (in the case of the Swing Line Sublimit, on a pro rata basis across each of the Swing Line Canadian Dollar Sublimit, the Swing Line Euro Sublimit and the Swing Line Sterling Sublimit) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments.  Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender, according to its Pro Rata Share.  All facility fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 

2.07        Repayment of Loans  .

2.08        Interest  . 
    
  (a)        Subject to the provisions of   Section 2.08(b)  , (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; (iii) each Swing Line Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Rate; (iv) each Swing Line Loan denominated in Euro shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Euro Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (v) each Swing Line Loan denominated in Sterling shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Sterling Overnight Rate plus the Applicable Rate; 
  (b)        If any amount payable by a Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall, upon the request of the Required Lenders (provided no such request shall be required in the case of an Event of Default under   Section 8.01(f)   or 8.01  (g)  ) thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  Furthermore, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. 
  (c)        Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.

    50 

2.09        Fees  .  In addition to certain fees described in   Sections 2.03(i)   and 2.03  (j) 
    
  (a)        Facility Fee  .  The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a facility fee payable in Dollars on the tenth calendar day following the end of each calendar quarter, which shall be equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Committed Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage.  The facility fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans, Swing Line Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in   ARTICLE IV   are not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each date specified above following the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand).  The facility fee shall be calculated on a calendar quarter basis in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
  (b)        Other Fees  .  (i)  The Company shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and, except to the extent expressly otherwise agreed, shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
  (ii)        The Borrowers shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and, except to the extent expressly otherwise agreed, shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
   
  2.10        Computation of Interest and Fees  .  All computations of interest for Canadian Prime Rate Loans and for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America s  prime rate  shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year) or, in the case of interest in respect of other Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,   provided   that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to   Section 2.12(a)  , bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  
    51 

2.11        Evidence of Debt  . 
  (a)        The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach Schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
  (b)        In addition to the accounts and records referred to in   Section 2.11(a)  , each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
  
    52 

2.12        Payments Generally  . 
    
  (a)        All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 12:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States or such other address as the Administrative Agent specifies from time to time.  If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent amount of the Alternative Currency payment amount.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office.  All payments received by an Agent after the applicable time specified in this   Section 2.12(a)   shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by a Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
  
    53 

(b)      (i  )  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to (a) the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (b) two hours prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   Section 2.02   and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Agent, then such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by any Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Agent. 
  (ii)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. 
  A notice of the Agent to any Lender or the applicable Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this   subsection (b)   shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
  (c)        If any Lender makes available to the Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this   ARTICLE II  , and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in   ARTICLE IV    are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
  
    54 

(d)        The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to   Section 11.04(c)   are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation, to make any such purchase or to make any payment under   Section 11.04(c)   on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, fund any participation or to make any purchase or payment. 
  (e)        Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
   
  2.13        Sharing of Payments  .  If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Committed Loans, or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them;   provided,     however  , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in     Section 11.05   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to   Section 11.08  ) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this   Section 2.13   and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this   Section 2.13   shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. 

2.14        [Reserved].  

55 

2.15        Increase in Commitments.    
    
  (a)        Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Company may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $1,000,000,000.  At the time of sending such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).  Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no such Lender shall have an obligation to so agree) and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase.  Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Lender of the Lenders  responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.15(a)  , during the first 90 days following the date hereof, the Company may invite Eligible Assignees to become Lenders under this Agreement in connection with a requested increase without first providing any Lender with the opportunity to increase its Commitment as provided above. 
  (b)        If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this   Section 2.15  , the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the    Increase Effective Date   ) and the final allocation of such increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.  As a condition precedent to such increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Company, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in   ARTICLE V   and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that, for purposes of this   Section 2.15  , (1) the representation and warranty contained in   Section 5.08(a)    shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to   Section 6.01(a)   and 6.01  (b)  , respectively, and (2) the reference to the date hereof in   Section 5.05(b)   and   Section 5.08(b)    shall be deemed to refer to the Increase Effective Date and (B) no Default exists.  The Company shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to   Section 3.05  ) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this   Section 2.15  . 
  
    56 

(c)        In the event of an increase in Commitments pursuant to this   Section 2.15  , the provisions of this   Section 2.15   shall govern any conflicts with provisions in   Sections 2.13   or      11.01  . 
   
  2.16        Designation of Borrowers 
    
  (a)        The Company may at any time, upon not less than 15 Business Days  notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), designate any consolidated Subsidiary of the Company that is organized in a Designated Borrower Jurisdiction and that is engaged in a line of business that is substantially similar to those lines of businesses conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (an    Applicant Borrower   ) as a Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of   Exhibit E-1   (a    Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement   ).  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such  know your customer  information, supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents  or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or in the case of  know your customer  information, each Lender) in their sole discretion, including, without limitation, with respect to an Applicant Borrower that is organized under the laws of Germany, evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that such Applicant Borrower (i) is an entity incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany as a limited liability company (  Gesellschaft mit beschr nkter Haftung  ) and (ii) satisfies asset, revenue, and minimum employee tests required under the laws of Germany to permit a U.S. Lender to lend to such Applicant Borrower and Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require.  If the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders agree that an Applicant Borrower shall be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents  or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of   Exhibit E-2   (a    Designated Borrower Notice   ) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof (the    Designated Borrower Effective Date   ), whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Designated Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement;   provided   that no Committed Loan Notice, Swing Line Notice or Letter of Credit Application may be submitted by or on behalf of such Designated Borrower until the date five Business Days after the Designated Borrower Effective Date applicable to such Designated Borrower. 
  
    57 

(b)        The Obligations of the Company and each Designated Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary shall be joint and several in nature.  The Obligations of all Designated Borrowers that are Foreign Subsidiaries shall be several in nature. The Company shall execute a Guaranty in respect of any Designated Borrower prior to or on the Designated Borrower Effective Date applicable to such Designated Borrower.  Any Designated Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary shall execute a Guaranty in respect of the Company s and any other Designated Borrower s Obligations hereunder prior to or on the Designated Borrower Effective Date applicable to such Designated Borrower.  In the case the Company designates a Designated Borrower, the Company and each Designated Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a reaffirmation agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Person s Guaranty prior to or on the Designated Borrower Effective Date applicable to such Designated Borrower so designated by the Company. 
  (c)        Each Subsidiary of the Company that becomes a  Designated Borrower  pursuant to this   Section 2.16   hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, and (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Designated Borrower hereunder.  Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Company, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein.  Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Designated Borrower. 
  (d)    The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days  notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrower s status as such, provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or other amounts payable by such Designated Borrower on account of any Loans made to it, as of the effective date of such termination.

As soon as practicable (but in any event not more than five Business Days) after receipt of notice from the Company or the Administrative Agent of the Company s intent to designate a Designated Foreign Borrower, any Protesting Lender shall notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to lend to such Designated Foreign Borrower.

Any Lender, Swing Line Lender or L/C Issuer that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Response Deadline shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender.

  (e)        Minimum Extension Requirement  .  If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders (including Swing Line Lenders and L/C Issuers) that have agreed to so extend the Maturity Date (each, an    Extending Lender   ) and the Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall be more than 51% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the related Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the related Anniversary Date (but subject to the prior satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clause (f) below), the Maturity Date of this Agreement and the Maturity Date with respect to the Commitments of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a  Lender ,  Swing Line Lender  and/or  L/C Issuer , as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender shall remain in full force and effect until and shall terminate on the Existing Maturity Date for such Non-Extending Lender, unless such Non-Extending Lender is replaced prior to the related Anniversary Date by an Additional Commitment Lender as provided in clause (d) above.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this   Section 2.18(a)(ii)   will be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  
    62 

(iii)        Certain Fees  .  A Defaulting Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive any facility fee pursuant to   Section 2.09(a)   for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans funded by it and (2) its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral (and the Borrowers shall (A) be required to pay to each L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive letter of credit fees as provided in   Section 2.03(i)  .  Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral.  With respect to any facility fee or letter of credit fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender, the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
  (iv)        Reallocation of Pro Rata Shares to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment), but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment and provided that each such reallocation will be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)        Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans.    If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law; (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders  Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers  Fronting Exposure.

(b)        Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Company, Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares (without giving effect to   Section 2.18(a)(iv),   whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that (x) to the extent that any non-Defaulting Lender incurs any loss, cost or expense as a result of such purchase of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan, such Defaulting Lender shall reimburse such non-Defaulting Lenders for any such loss, cost or expense, (y) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender and (z) except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  
    64 

(ii)  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Party to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 10.06(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this   clause (ii)  .

  (e)        (i)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A) set forth in   Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A)  ,   (ii)(B)   and   (ii)(D)   below or (B) required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  
    65 

(ii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Person, 
  (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed  copies of IRS Form W 9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  
    
  (B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

66 

(IV)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed  copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BENE (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit J-2   or   Exhibit J-3  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit J-4   on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
    
  (C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed  copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
    
  (D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this   clause (D)  ,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
    
  (iii)  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

67 

(f)        Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 3.01  , it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this   Section 3.01   with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
  (g)        Each party s obligations under this   Section 3.01   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
  
    68 

3.02        Illegality  . 
    
  (a)        If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or charge interest with respect to Credit Extensions or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, solely in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate.  If any of the circumstances set forth above arise with respect to Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Alternative Currency denominated Loans shall be made or maintained, as applicable, at a rate for short term borrowings of such Alternative Currency determined in a customary manner in good faith by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Company.

3.03        Inability to Determine Rates  .   
    
  If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof,  (a) (i) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (ii)  adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (a) above, the    Impacted Loans   ) or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) without cost or penalty or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
  (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in this section, the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Company and the Required Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders     notify the Administrative Agent and the Company that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such     Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Company written notice thereof.

  (ii)        subject any Lender or Agent to any taxes of any kind whatsoever (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes that are covered by   Section 3.01  , (B) Taxes described in   clauses (b)-(d)   of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or L/C Issuer, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        Capital Requirements  .  If any Lender or L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender s or L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. 
  (d)        Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this   Section 3.04   shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that, notwithstanding the provisions of   Sections 3.04(a)  ,   3.04(b)   and 3.04(c), (i) the Borrowers shall only be liable for amounts in respect of increased costs or reductions for the period beginning up to six months prior to the date on which such demand was made (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof), and (ii) the Lender claiming compensation therefor shall have applied consistent return metrics applied to other similarly situated borrowers or obligors with respect to such increased costs or reductions. 
   
  3.05        Funding Losses  .  Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

  (c)        any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or 
  
    72 

(d)        any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to   Section 11.15  ;  
  including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained for the performance of any foreign exchange contracts, in each case, excluding loss of any anticipated profits; 
  provided   that the Company shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any of the foregoing amounts incurred in connection with such Lender being a Defaulting Lender. 
  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this   Section 3.05  , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

The Company hereby agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment requested by the Company. 
  (c)        Upon any Lender s making a claim for compensation under   Section 3.04   or if any Borrower is required to pay amounts to any Lender under   Section 3.01   as a result of any Taxes or Other Taxes, in each case the Company may, subject to Section 3.06(b), replace such Lender in accordance with   Section 11.15  .

The provisions of this   ARTICLE IX   are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions other than the provisions of   Section 9.06   relating to the Company s consultation and notice rights.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this   Section 11.06(b)    shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with   Section 11.06(d)  . 
  
    107 

No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the  Trade Date ) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Company has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation). Upon receipt of a list of Disqualified Institutions from the Company (or any updates thereto), the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide such list or updates, as applicable, to the Lenders (including by posting to a Platform).  Any Person shall become a  Disqualified Institution  for purposes of this Agreement two (2) Business Days after the Administrative Agent provides such list or updates, as applicable, to the Lenders (including by posting to a Platform).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to the definition of  Disqualified Institution ), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and  (y) the execution by the Company of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment in violation of this paragraph shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (b) shall apply.   
   If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Company s prior written consent in violation of the preceding paragraph, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all obligations of the applicable Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Commitment, and/or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.   
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization, each Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such plan of reorganization, (2) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such plan of reorganization notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be  designated  pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such plan of reorganization in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

  (d)        (i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, any Borrower, any of the Borrowers  Affiliates or Subsidiaries and any Defaulting Lender) (each, a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it);   provided   that (i) unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have approved the sale of participations to such Person (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) [Reserved]; (iii) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (iv) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (v) the Borrowers, the Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement; and (vi) such Lender complies with   Section 11.06(d)(ii)  .  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to   Section 11.01    that directly affects such Participant.  Subject to   Section 11.06(e)  , the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 3.01  ,   3.04   and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   Section 11.06(b)     (it being understood that the documentation required under   Section 3.01(e)   shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   paragraph (b)   of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 11.08    as though it were a Lender,     provided     such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.13    as though it were a Lender. 
  
    109 

(ii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as  a non-fiduciary agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. 
  (f)        Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central banking authority;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     Eligible Assignee    means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer and (ii) unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);   provided   that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)  Eligible Assignee  shall not include (x) any Borrower, any of the Borrowers  Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or any Defaulting Lender or (y) any Disqualified Institution.

In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrowers, any such notice being waived by the Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;   provided  ,   however   that (i) the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application and (ii) in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of   Section 2.18   and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. 

11.09        Interest Rate Limitation  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the    Maximum Rate   ).  If the Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Company.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 

11.10        Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

11.11        Integration  .  This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control;   provided   that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 

11.12        Survival of Representations and Warranties  .  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Agent and each Lender, regardless  
  
    115 

of any investigation made by the Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 

11.13        Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

11.14        [Reserved] 
   
  11.15        Replacement of Lenders  .  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under   Section 3.04  , (ii) a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 3.01  , (iii) any Lender is a Non-Extending Lender for any extension of the Maturity Date, (iv) any Lender is a  Defaulting Lender , (v) any Lender does not consent to an amendment to the definition of Designated Borrower Jurisdiction that has been consented to by the Required Lenders, (vi) any Lender is a Protesting Lender under Section 2.16 or (vii) any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives any Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then, subject to Section 3.06(b), such Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 11.06  ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),   provided   that: 
    
  (a)        the Company shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 11.06(b)  ; 
  (b)        such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under   Section 3.05  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (c)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 3.04   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 3.01  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;  
  (d)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from clause (v) above, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the proposed amendment;  
  (e)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from clause (vi) above, such assignee shall have consented to make Loans to the applicable Designated Foreign Borrower.  
  
    116 

(e)        such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
   
  11.16        Governing Law  . 
    
  (a)        THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE;     PROVIDED   THAT THE AGENT, EACH SWING LINE LENDER, THE L/C ISSUER AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

  11.17        Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury  .  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 

11.18        No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility  .  In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates  understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers, on the other hand, (B) such Borrower and each other Loan Party has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) such Borrower and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A)  the Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) Neither the Agent nor the Lenders nor any of the Arrangers has any obligation to any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Agent nor the Lenders nor the Arrangers has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Agent, the Lenders or the Arrangers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 

11.19        USA Patriot Act Notice  .  Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub.  L.  107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the    Act   ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act. 

117 

11.20        Judgment  .  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of a Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the    Judgment Currency   ) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the    Agreement Currency   ), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in the Agreement Currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

  FORM OF GUARANTY 
    
  THIS GUARANTY dated as of [ ], 20[ ] (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this    Guaranty   ), made by and among McKesson Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (the    Company    and, together with any other entity that becomes a guarantor hereunder pursuant to Section 18, the    Guarantors   ) and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the    Administrative Agent   ) for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties. 
  WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Credit Agreement dated as of October 22, 2015 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the    Credit Agreement    capitalized terms defined therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as therein defined) among McKesson Corporation, a Delaware corporation, the Designated Borrowers from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the    Lenders   ), the Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as L/C Issuer, and Bank of America, N.A. (acting through its Canada branch), Citibank, N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC, each as Swing Line Lender.  The Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lenders and the L/C Issuer are hereinafter referred to as the    Guaranteed Parties   . 
  WHEREAS, the Company may be required from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement to cause certain of its Subsidiaries to join this Guaranty or enter into such other guarantee agreements as provided in the Credit Agreement; and 
  WHEREAS, each Guarantor will obtain benefits from the incurrence of Loans by any Borrower and the issuance of, and participation in, Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement and, accordingly, desires to execute this Guaranty in order to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders and the L/C Issuer to make Loans to any Borrower and issue, and/or participate in, Letters of Credit. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and hereby covenants and agrees with each other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties as follows: 
  Section 1.      Guaranty  .  Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranties, as primary obligor and not merely as surety to the Guaranteed Parties, the due and punctual payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations (as defined below) when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.    362(a)).  The term    Guarantied Obligations    is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and includes: 
  
   Exhibit I-1 

(a)    any and all Obligations of each Borrower (other than the applicable Guarantor s own Obligations) now or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Notes issued by any Borrower and the other Loan Documents, including those arising under successive borrowing transactions under the Credit Agreement which shall either continue the Obligations of each Borrower or from time to time renew them after they have been satisfied; and 
  (b)    those expenses set forth in Section 8. 
  Section 2.      Liability of the Guarantors Absolute  .  Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows: 
  (a)    This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and not of collectibility. 
  (b)    The Administrative Agent may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between Lenders and any Borrower with respect to the existence of such Event of Default. 
  (c)    The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor under the Loan Documents and the obligations of any other guarantor of the obligations of any Guarantor under the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against any of such other Guarantors or any of such other guarantors and whether or not any of such other Guarantors is joined in any such action or actions. 
  (d)    Each Guarantor s payment of a portion, but not all, of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge such Guarantor s liability for any portion of the Guarantied Obligations that has not been paid.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any Guarantor s covenant to pay a portion of the Guarantied Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guarantied Obligations that is not the subject of such suit. 
  
   Exhibit I-2 

(e)    The Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any Guarantor s liability under this Guaranty, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guarantied Obligations, (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations and take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations in accordance with any applicable security agreement; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guarantied Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guarantied Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guarantied Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of this Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, may have against any such security, as the Administrative Agent in its discretion may determine consistent with the Credit Agreement and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against any other Guarantor or any security for the Guarantied Obligations; and (vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Loan Documents.  This Section 2(e) shall not modify Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement. 
  
   Exhibit I-3 

(f)    This Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations), including the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce, or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Loan Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guarantied Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including provisions relating to Events of Default) of this Guaranty, any of the other Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or security for the Guarantied Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty or such Loan Document or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security; (iii) the Guarantied Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto, at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Loan Documents or from the proceeds of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations, even though the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guarantied Obligations; (v) any Lender s or the Administrative Agent s consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of any Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Guarantied Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any collateral which secures any of the Guarantied Obligations; (vii) any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which any Guarantor may allege or assert against the Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, including but not limited to failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury (but excluding the defense of payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations); and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guarantied Obligations. 
  Section 3.      Waivers by the Guarantors  .  Each Guarantor hereby waives with respect to the Guarantied Obligations, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders: 
  (a)    any right to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as a condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against any Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from such Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in favor of such Guarantor or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of the Administrative Agent or any Lender whatsoever; 
  
   Exhibit I-4 

(b)    any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of any Guarantor including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of such Guarantor from any cause other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations; 
  (c)    any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; 
  (d)    any defense based upon the Administrative Agent s or any Lender s errors or omissions in the administration of the Guarantied Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; 
  (e)    (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Guaranty and any legal or equitable discharge of any Guarantor s obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting any Guarantor s liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto;

  (g)    any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Guaranty. 
  Section 4.      Payment by the Guarantors; Application of Payments  .  Each Guarantor hereby agrees, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any other Person may have at law or in equity against such Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of any Guarantor to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when and as the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.    362(a)), each Guarantor will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders holding the Guarantied Obligations, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all Guarantied Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to such Guarantor, would have accrued on such Guarantied Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against such Guarantor for such interest in any such bankruptcy proceeding) and all other Guarantied Obligations then owed to the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders as aforesaid.  All such payments shall be applied promptly from time to time by the Administrative Agent: 
  
   Exhibit I-5 

First  , to the payment of the costs and expenses of any collection or other realization under this Guaranty, including reasonable compensation to the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith; 
  Second  , to the payment of all other Guarantied Obligations to each Lender holding Guarantied Obligations its applicable share as provided in the Credit Agreement; and 
  Third  , after payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations, to the payment to each Guarantor, or its successors or assigns, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining from such payments. 
  Section 5.      Each Guarantor s Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, Etc  .  Until the Guarantied Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of (a) any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including 
   (i) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, (ii) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that the Administrative Agent or any Lender now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, and (iii) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and (b) any right of contribution any Guarantor may have against any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Borrower or other Guarantor, to all right, title and interest the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such other guarantor.  The Administrative Agent, on behalf of Lenders, may use, sell or dispose of any item of collateral or security as it sees fit without regard to any subrogation rights any Guarantor may have, and upon any such disposition or sale any rights of subrogation against such collateral such Guarantor may have shall terminate.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification rights at any time when all Guarantied Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof. 
  
   Exhibit I-6 

Section 6.      Subordination of Other Obligations  .  Any indebtedness of any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any other Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantied Obligations, and any such indebtedness of such Guarantor to any other Guarantor collected or received by such Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under any other provision of this Guaranty. 
  Section 7.      Representations and Warranties of the Guarantors  .  As of the date hereof, each Guarantor represents and warrants that: 
  (a)    such Guarantor (i) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, (ii) has the power and authority and all required governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to own its assets, carry on its business and to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this Guaranty, (iii) is duly qualified and is licensed and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, and (iv) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law; except, with respect to clause (iii) or clause (iv), to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
  (b)    such Guarantor has duly executed and delivered this Guaranty, and this Guaranty constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability; 
  (c)    the execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Guaranty do not (i) require any approval, consent, exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority (each of the foregoing, an  Authorization ), except to the extent that failure to have obtained or completed, as applicable, such Authorization would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) contravene the terms of such Guarantor s Organization Documents, (iii) conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which such Guarantor is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any Governmental Authority to which such Guarantor or its property is subject or (iv) violate any Requirement of Law; and 
  (d)    there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the best knowledge of such Guarantor, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in arbitration or before any Governmental Authority, against such Guarantor affecting the validity of this Guaranty or the ability of such Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty. 
  Section 8.      Expenses  .  Each Guarantor agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, on demand, and to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless against liability for, any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and reasonable allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this Guaranty. 
  
   Exhibit I-7 

Section 9.      Continuing Guaranty; Termination of Guaranty  .  This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the Guarantied Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments shall have terminated.  Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving rise to any Guarantied Obligations.  No failure or delay on the part of any Guaranteed Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 
  Section 10.      Authority of any Guarantor  .  It is not necessary for any Lender or the Administrative Agent to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any Guarantor. 
  Section 11.      Financial Condition of the Guarantors  .  Any extensions of credit may be granted to any Guarantor or continued from time to time without notice to or authorization from any other Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of such Guarantor at the time of any such grant or continuation.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with any Guarantor their assessment, or such Guarantor s assessment, of the financial condition of any Guarantor.  Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from each other Guarantor on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of such Guarantor and its ability to pay and perform its respective Guarantied Obligations for so long as this Guaranty is in effect, and each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of each other Guarantor and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations.  Each Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of any Guarantor now known or hereafter known by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
  Section 12.      Rights Cumulative  .  The rights, powers and remedies given to the Lenders and the Administrative by this Guaranty are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies given to any Lender and the Administrative Agent by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the other Loan Documents or any agreement between any Guarantor and any Lender and/or the Administrative Agent.  Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay by any Lender or the Administrative Agent in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of any such right, power or remedy. 
  Section 13.      Bankruptcy; Post-Petition Interest; Reinstatement of Guaranty  .   
  
   Exhibit I-8 

(a)    So long as any Guarantied Obligations remain outstanding, each Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceedings of or against any Guarantor.  The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any Guarantor or by any defense which such Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated except with the written consent of each Guarantor directly affected thereby (it being understood that the addition or release of any Guarantor hereunder shall not constitute a change, waiver, discharge or termination affecting any Guarantor other than the applicable Guarantor so added or released) and with the written consent of the applicable Persons required pursuant to Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement at all times until the termination of this Guaranty pursuant to Section 9 hereof.

  Section 18.      Additional Guarantors  .  Any Person required to become party to this Guaranty pursuant to Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement may do so by executing and delivering a Guaranty Supplement in the form attached hereto at Exhibit I and such Person shall become a Guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein.  The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor hereunder.  The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor as a party to this Guaranty. 
  Section 19.      Governing Law  . 
  (a)    THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT EACH GUARANTEED PARTY SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.   
  (b)    ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS GUARANTY, EACH PARTY HERETO CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS.  EACH PARTY TO THIS GUARANTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS GUARANTY.  EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

The obligation of a Guarantor in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the    Judgment Currency   ) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the    Agreement Currency   ), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in the Agreement Currency, each Guarantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Guarantor (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
