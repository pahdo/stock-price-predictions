      Table of Contents           EOS INC.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (UNAUDITED)       NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited financial statements, footnote disclosures, and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    Basis of Presentation and Organization       EOS Inc., a company in the developmental stage (the  Company ), was incorporated on April 3, 2015 in the State of Nevada. The Company has conducted limited business operations and had no revenues from operations since its inception. The Company s business plan is to market and distribute skin care products, including masks and serums.       Going Concern       These financial statements were prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to going concern, which assumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of $294,769 and $149,991 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and it had no revenue from operations.     The Company faces all the risks common to companies at development stage, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources, high initial expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams, and difficulties in managing growth. The Company's losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     The Company is currently addressing its liquidity issue by continually seeking additional funds through private placements of its securities and/or capital contributions and loans by Yu-Cheng Yang, its president and sole director. The Company believes its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this time.                  8       
      Table of Contents          These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts which may differ from those in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.       Net Income (loss) per Share       Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. At September 30, 2016, the Company does not have any outstanding common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented.       Income Taxes       Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     The Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes , which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes.                  9       
      Table of Contents          Any such adjustment could be material to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. At September 30, 2016, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations, financial position or cash flow.       Subsequent events       Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring recognition as of September 30, 2016 have been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855,  Subsequent Events.       NOTE 2. ACCRUED EXPENSES      Accrued expenses consist of the following:            NOTE 3. DUE TO RELATED PARTIES      The Company has advanced funds from its officer and shareholder for working capital purposes. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $175,912 and $150,000 advances outstanding, respectively. The Company has agreed that the outstanding balances bear 0% interest rate and are due upon demand after 30 days written notice by the officer and shareholder.      NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES      As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $294,769 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.            The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from April 3, 2015 (Inception) to September 30, 2015           The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:           The difference between the effective rate reflected in the provision for income taxes on loss before taxes and the amounts determined by applying the applicable statutory U.S. tax rate are analyzed below:                        For the nine months ended September 30, 2016                                  Statutory tax benefit             (34  )%     Nondeductible/nontaxable items             -          Change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance             34  %     Provision for income taxes             -   %         For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties expenses. Currently, the Company is not subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.      NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT      From April 3, 2015 to December 31, 2015, the Company has issued 54,122,997 common stock shares at par value in a total amount of $54,123 from its shareholders.     On February 24, 2016, the Company has issued 10,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock shares at a purchase price of $0.01 per share in a total amount of $100,000 from fifteen shareholders.                Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.         Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements       This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this discussion and analysis by management, contains or incorporates forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made in report are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  believes,   estimates,   could,   possibly,   probably,  anticipates,   projects,   expects,   may,   will,  or  should  or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations.      The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.      Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015      Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was $0. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was $0.     General and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal and professional service fees. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $11,783, as compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in those expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in accounting, legal and professional fees.     Our net loss was $(11,783) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was a result of the increase in general and administrative expenses.      Nine months ended September 30, 2016      Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $0. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $34. From April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2016, our net revenue was $0. From April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015, our interest income was $0.     General and administrative expenses primarily consist of accounting, legal, and professional service fees. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $144,812. From April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015, our general and administrative expenses were $150,000. The decrease in those expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and professional fees.     Our net loss was $(144,778) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. From April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015, our net loss was $(150,000). The decrease in loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal and professional fees.             Liquidity and Capital Resources      Cash and cash equivalents were $48,416 at September 30, 2016, and $54,132 at December 31, 2015. Our total current assets were $48,416 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $54,132 at December 31, 2015. Our total current liabilities were $189,062 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $150,000 at December 31, 2015.      We had negative working capital at September 30, 2016, of $(140,646), compared to negative working capital of $(95,868) at December 31, 2015. The increase in negative working capital was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses and amounts due to related parties.  Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $(131,628). Net cash used in operating activities from April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015, was $(150,000).      Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $125,912. Net cash provided by financing activities from April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015, was $204,123. The decrease was primarily due to less working capital loaned from officer, partially offset by the increase in proceeds from issuance of common stocks.     Net change in cash and cash equivalents was a decrease of $(5,716) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net change in cash and cash equivalents was an increase of $54,123 from April 3, 2015 (date of inception) through September 30, 2015.      Inflation      Our opinion is that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations and is not expected to have any material effect on our operations.      Climate Change      Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
