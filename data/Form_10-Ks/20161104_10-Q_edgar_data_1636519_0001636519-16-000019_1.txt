  Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of Business 
  The Madison Square Garden Company (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Madison Square Garden ) is a live sports and entertainment business. The Company classifies its business interests into   two   reportable segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports. MSG Entertainment includes live entertainment events such as concerts, family shows, performing arts and special events, which are presented or hosted in the Company s diverse collection of venues. MSG Entertainment also includes the Company's original productions     Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes   (   Christmas Spectacular   ) and   New York Spectacular Starring The Radio City Rockettes   (   New York Spectacular   )   as well as Boston Calling Events, the   live events   production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. MSG Sports includes the Company s professional sports franchises: the New York Knicks (the    Knicks   ) of the National Basketball Association (the    NBA   ), the New York Rangers (the    Rangers   ) of the National Hockey League (the    NHL   ), the New York Liberty (the    Liberty   ) of the Women s National Basketball Association (the    WNBA   ), the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (the    AHL   ) and the Westchester Knicks of the NBA Development League (the    NBADL   ). The MSG Sports segment is also home to a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, tennis and college wrestling, all of which the Company promotes, produces and/or presents. 
  The Company conducts a significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns the Madison Square Garden Arena ( The Garden ) and The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, the Company leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and has a booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. 
  The Company was incorporated on March 4, 2015 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Networks Inc. (   MSG Networks    or    Former Parent   ), formerly known as The Madison Square Garden Company. On September 11, 2015,   MSG Networks    board of directors approved the distribution of all the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden to MSG Networks  shareholders (the    Distribution   ), which occurred on September 30, 2015. See Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   for more information regarding the   Distribution   to its common stockholders. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated and combined interim financial statements (referred to as the  Financial Statements  herein) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (   GAAP   ) and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information, and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . The Financial Statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, the Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year. The dependence of the MSG Sports segment on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company's fiscal year. The dependence of the MSG Entertainment segment on revenues from the   Radio City Christmas Spectacular   generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second quarter of the Company s fiscal year. 
  For the periods after the Distribution, the financial information disclosed   is presented on a consolidated basis, as the Company became a standalone public company on September 30, 2015.    For the periods prior to the Distribution, the financial information was prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Former Parent and are presented as carve-out financial statements as the Company was not a standalone public company prior to the Distribution. See Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   for more information regarding the basis of presentation for periods before and after the Distribution.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Continued) 

The combined statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 include allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by MSG Networks and not historically recorded at the business unit level, such as expenses related to finance, human resources, information technology, and facilities, among others. These expenses were allocated on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro-rata basis of combined revenues, headcount or other measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the combined financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and do not reflect its combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a separate, standalone public company during the periods presented on a combined basis. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, standalone public company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. 
  For purposes of the combined financial statements, income tax expense has been recorded as if the Company filed tax returns on a standalone basis separate from Former Parent. This separate return methodology applies to accounting guidance for income taxes in the combined financial statements as if the Company was a standalone public company for the periods prior to the Distribution. Therefore, cash tax payments and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective of the Company s actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the Distribution. Prior to the Distribution, the Company's operating results were included in Former Parent s consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Pursuant to rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities, the Company expects to file its initial U.S. income tax return for the period from October 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. The calculation of the Company s income taxes involves considerable judgment and use of both estimates and allocations. 
   
  Note   2  . Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation and Combination 
  For the periods prior to the Distribution, the financial statements include certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at Former Parent s corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to the Company. All intercompany transactions between the Company and Former Parent have been included in the combined financial statements as components of MSG Networks  investment. All significant intracompany transactions and accounts within the Company's consolidated and combined financial statements have been eliminated. Expenses related to corporate allocations prior to the Distribution were considered to be effectively settled in the combined financial statements at the time the transaction was recorded, with the offset recorded against MSG Networks  investment.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the accompanying Financial Statements in conformity with   GAAP   requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, tax accruals and other liabilities. In addition, estimates are used in revenue recognition, revenue sharing expense (net of escrow), luxury tax expense, income tax expense, performance and share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, litigation matters and other matters, as well as in the valuation of contingent consideration and noncontrolling interests resulting from business combination transactions. Management believes its use of estimates in the Financial Statements to be reasonable. 
  Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take in the future. The Company adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on management s best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. Changes in estimates resulting from weakness in the economic environment or other factors beyond the Company s control could be material and would be reflected in the Company s financial statements in future periods.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The following is an update to the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  : 
  Business Combinations 
  The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the management to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the Company is allowed to adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination). 
  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company recognizes separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. The Company measures goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which is also measured at fair value if the consideration is non-cash, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that the Company incurs to complete a business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and the Company charges these costs to selling, general and administrative expense as they are incurred. In addition, the Company recognizes measurement-period adjustments in the period in which the amount is determined, including the effect on earnings of any amounts the Company would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.   
  On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Boston Calling Events, LLC (   BCE   ). In accordance with      Accounting Standards Codification (   ASC   )   Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , and   ASC   Topic 810,   Consolidation  , the financial position of   BCE   has been consolidated to the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The results of operations for   BCE   have been included in the Company s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition in the MSG Entertainment segment. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than the Company are reflected under  Noncontrolling interests  and  Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations, respectively.  
  See Note   3   for more information regarding the Company s acquisition of BCE.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  Deferred revenue reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   includes amounts due to the third-party promoters of   $40,965   and   $45,877  , respectively. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
  In February 2015, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   ) issued Accounting Standards Update (   ASU   )   No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which changes the analysis to be performed in determining whether certain types of legal entities should be consolidated. Specifically, it (1) modifies the assessment of whether limited partnerships are variable interest entities (each a  VIE ) or voting interest entities, (2) eliminates the presumption that a limited partnership should be consolidated by its general partner, (3) removes certain conditions for the evaluation of whether a fee paid to a decision maker constitutes a variable interest, and (4) modifies the evaluation concerning the impact of related parties in the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE. This standard was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2015-05,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract and expense the cost as the services are received. This standard was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 on a prospective basis for all arrangements entered into or materially modified after July 1, 2017. The adoption

  (Continued) 

of the standard did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the   FASB issued   ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  .  This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange f  or those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14  , Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  :   Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)  , which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard under ASU No. 2014-09. ASU No. 2016-08 clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the principle in ASU No 2014-09 for determining whether a good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, should be accounted for separately. ASU No 2016-10 also clarifies that entities are not required to identify promised goods or services that are immaterial in the context of the contract and allows entities to elect to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised service. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which clarifies the following aspects in ASU 2014-09: collectability, presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash considerations, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition, and technical correction. Early adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and the related updates discussed above is permitted and the Company can early adopt ASU No. 2014-09 and the related updates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. If the Company does not apply the early adoption provision, ASU No. 2014-09 and the related updates will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the standard and updates will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted with the exception of certain provisions related to the presentation of other comprehensive income. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Subtopic 842)  ( ASU No. 2016-02 )  , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in FASB ASC Topic 840,    Leases  . The new standard requires lessees to account for leases as either finance leases or operating leases and generally requires all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet, including those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting guidance, through the recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. The new standard also requires extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosures about leasing activities. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous accounting guidance. ASU No. 2016-02 is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach for all leases existing as of the effective date. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  . This standard eliminates the requirement for an investor to retrospectively apply the equity method when an investment that it had accounted for by another method qualifies for use of the equity method. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  . This standard requires the income tax effects of all awards to be recognized in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled. This standard also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares

for tax withholding purposes than currently allowable, without triggering liability accounting, and provides companies with the option to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, this standard requires companies to present excess tax benefits as operating activity rather than as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).   This standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues and is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . ASU No. 2016-16 requires entities to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Note   3  . Acquisitions 
  BCE Acquisition 
  On   July 1, 2016  , in connection with the Company s strategy to broaden its live experience offerings, the Company acquired a controlling interest in   BCE  , the   live events   production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. The Company acquired net tangible assets of   $2,221  . In addition, based on the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized   $11,800   of amortizable intangible assets and   $12,538   of goodwill. See Note   6   for more information regarding the intangible assets and goodwill recognized in this acquisition. The estimated fair value of the noncontrolling interest of   $11,394   was based on the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the lack of control and lack of marketability associated with the noncontrolling interests and was classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy as they were valued using unobservable inputs.

Components of net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan recognized in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:    

(a)   
    Effective July 1, 2016, the Company changed the approach used to measure service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan. Previously, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plans  obligations. Beginning fiscal year 2017, the Company elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans  liability cash flows ( Spot Rate Approach ). The Company believes the Spot Rate Approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of plans  obligations and it is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, which is applied prospectively. This change in estimate did not result in a material reduction of the net periodic costs for Pension Plans and Postretirement Plan for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , had the Company not changed the approach. 
     For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plans reported in the table above includes   $485   of expenses related to MSG Networks  employees, representing the contributory charge from the Company to MSG Networks for participation in the Pension Plans. In addition, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company allocated to MSG Networks   $229   of net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plans related to corporate employees not specifically identified to either the Company or MSG Networks.  
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the net periodic benefit cost for the Postretirement Plan reported in the table above includes   $18   of expenses related to MSG Networks employees, representing the contributory charge from the Company to MSG Networks for participation in the Postretirement Plan. In addition, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company allocated to MSG Networks   $11   of net periodic benefit cost for the Postretirement Plan related to corporate employees not specifically identified to either the Company or MSG Networks.  
  In addition, prior to the Distribution, MSG Networks sponsored the MSG Holdings, L.P. 401(k) Savings Plan and the MSG Holdings, L.P. Excess Savings Plan (collectively, the    Savings Plans   ). In connection with the Distribution, the MSG Holdings, L.P. 401(k) Savings Plan was converted into a multiple employer plan and pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, the Company became the sponsor and a contributing employer to this plan. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , expenses related to the   Savings Plans  , excluding expenses related to MSG Networks  employees, included in the accompanying combined statements of operations were   $1,118   and   $832  , respectively. The amount for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   includes   $89   of expenses related to the Company s corporate employees which were allocated to MSG Networks.

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , expenses related to the Union Savings Plan included in the accompanying combined statements of operations were   $22   and   $18  , respectively.

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , share-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeiture, was recognized in the consolidated and combined statements of operations as a component of direct operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and was   $8,355   and   $3,105  , respectively.

  The fair value of RSUs that vested during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $13,642  .

On June 21, 2016, Cablevision was acquired by a subsidiary of Altice N.V. and a change in control occurred, which resulted in members of the Dolan Family no longer being controlling stockholders of the surviving company, Altice USA. Accordingly, Altice USA is not a related party of the Company, and thus the related party transactions disclosed herein that relate to Cablevision were recognized prior to June 21, 2016.

  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Corporate general and administrative expense, net - MSG Networks amount reflects charges from the Company to MSG Networks under the TSA of   $2,048  , net of general and administrative costs charged to the Company by MSG Networks. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company s corporate overhead expenses are primarily related to centralized functions, including executive compensation, finance, treasury, tax, internal audit, legal, information technology, human resources and risk management functions.

  Note 15. Income Taxes  
  Income tax (benefit) expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $(2,934)   and   $122  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   9.2%   and   (8.2)%  , respectively.  
  The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is different when compared to the statutory federal rate of   35%     as a result of     $11,201     of recorded Federal and state valuation allowances which offset the benefit of most of  the operating losses. Such increase in the valuation allowances reflects a reduction of     $3,126     as the mark-to-market gains on available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income allowed for the recognition of benefit on a portion of such operating losses. The income tax benefit also reflects expense of     $138     primarily related to non-deductible expenses.    
  The Company s effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   is different when compared to the statutory federal rate of   35%     as a result of Federal and state valuation allowances recorded against operating losses.

The Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company s policy is to reflect interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, as a component of income tax expense. 
   
  Note   16  . Segment Information 
  The Company is comprised of   two   reportable segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports. In determining its reportable segments, the Company assessed the guidance of FASB ASC 280-10-50-1, which provides the definition of an operating segment. The Company has evaluated this guidance and determined that there are two reportable segments based upon the information provided to its chief operating decision maker. The Company allocates certain corporate costs to each of its reportable segments. In addition, the Company allocates its venue operating expenses to each of its reportable segments. Allocated venue operating expenses include the non-event related costs of operating the Company s venues, and include such costs as rent for the Company s leased venues, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and labor related to the overall management of the venues. Depreciation expense related to The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, and the Forum is not allocated to the reportable segments and is reported in    All other  .  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company refined its approach to allocating   corporate, venue operating and other shared expenses  . Management analyzed the specific support provided by individual corporate and venue personnel using a detailed efforts-based analysis. The Company considered this approach to better refine segment profitability for users of the financial information and, therefore, made this change in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Prior period results are reflected as originally reported and have not been restated. Had the revised approach been used in fiscal year 2016, operating income (loss) reported in MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 would have improved by approximately   $1,928   and   $536  , respectively. This improvement would have been offset by an increase of   $2,464   in the operating loss of   All other  . The adjusted operating income reported in MSG Sports and MSG Entertainment during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 would have improved by approximately   $1,637   and   $935  , respectively. This improvement would have been offset by an increase of   $2,572   in the adjusted operating loss of   All other  . 
  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is their operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses, which is referred to as   adjusted operating income (loss)  , a non-GAAP measure. The Company believes   adjusted operating income (loss)   is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis.   Adjusted operating income (loss)   and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company s performance. The Company uses revenues and   adjusted operating income (loss)   measures as the most important indicators of its business performance, and evaluates management s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  
  Adjusted operating income (loss)   should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has presented the components that reconcile   adjusted operating income (loss)   to operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

  All dollar amounts included in the following MD A are presented in thousands, except as otherwise noted. 
  Introduction 
  MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to  we,   us,   our,   Madison Square Garden  or the  Company  refer collectively to The Madison Square Garden Company, a holding company, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries through which substantially all of our operations are actually conducted. The Company is comprised of two reportable segments: MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports. MSG Entertainment includes live entertainment events such as concerts, family shows, performing arts events and special events, which are presented or hosted in the Company s diverse collection of venues. MSG Entertainment also includes the Company's original productions     Christmas Spectacular   and   New York Spectacular      as well as Boston Calling Events, the   live events   production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. MSG Sports includes the Company s professional sports franchises: the   Knicks   of the   NBA  , the   Rangers   of the   NHL  , the   Liberty   of the   WNBA  , the Hartford Wolf Pack of the   AHL  , and the Westchester Knicks of the   NBADL  . The MSG Sports segment is also home to a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, tennis and college wrestling, all of which the Company promotes, produces and/or presents. 
  The Company conducts a significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns The Garden and The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre in Chicago. In addition, the Company leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and has a booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. 
  Factors Affecting Results of Operations 
  The consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     is presented on a consolidated basis, as the Company became a standalone public company on September 30, 2015.   The Company's combined statements of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Former Parent and are presented as carve-out financial statements as the Company was not a standalone public company prior to the Distribution. 
  The combined statements of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   include allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by MSG Networks and not historically recorded at the business unit level, such as expenses related to finance, human resources, information technology, and facilities, among others. These expenses were allocated on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro-rata basis of combined revenues, headcount or other measures. Management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the combined financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and may not reflect its combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a separate, standalone company during the period presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. 
  This MD A is organized as follows: 
  Results of Operations.   This section provides an analysis of our unaudited results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   on a consolidated and where applicable, combined and segment basis. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources.   This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity, an analysis of our cash flows for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , as well as certain contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements.

  Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.    

NM   Percentage is not meaningful 
  The following is a summary of changes in revenues, direct operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses by segment for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year period.  

(a)   
    See  Business Segment Results  for a more detailed discussion relating to the operating results of our segments. 
               (b)   
    See Note   16   to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in  Part I   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of the Company s refinement of its methodologies used to allocate its   corporate, venue operating and other shared expenses  . 
       
     Selling, general and administrative expenses  
  The   increase   in Other reflects   (i) an increase in employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) the Company being subject to New York State and City capital tax during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and (iii) higher professional fees primarily associated with the Company s business development initiatives. The increase in employee compensation and related benefits was primarily a result of the Company operating as a standalone public company in the current year period and the absence of certain costs in the prior year period, based on accounting requirements for the preparation of carve-out financial statements. As such, certain costs reported in the combined statement of operations for the prior year period do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and do not reflect its combined results of operations had it been a separate,

standalone public company during the prior year period. See    Factors Affecting Results of Operations  for a discussion of the comparability of financial results.    
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $870  , or   3%  , to   $26,110   as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher depreciation expense on property and equipment placed into service in October 2015 and amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Earnings (loss) in equity method investments    
  Earnings in equity method investments for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $3,673  , or   137%  , to a loss of   $994  . Earnings (loss) in equity method investments reflects the Company s share of the net earnings (loss) of equity method investments, inclusive of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with these investments. The Company s share of the earnings (loss) of its equity method investments is recorded on a three-month lag basis. The year-over-year decrease reflects the absence of non-recurring gains in the prior year period at one of our joint ventures. 
  Income taxes  
  Income tax   benefit   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $2,934   and income tax   expense   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $122  .  
  The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   9.2%   is different when compared to the statutory federal rate of   35%     as a result of     $11,201     of recorded Federal and state valuation allowances which offset the benefit of most of  the operating losses. Such increase in the valuation allowances reflects a reduction of     $3,126     as the mark-to-market gains on available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive income allowed for the recognition of benefit on a portion of such operating losses. The income tax benefit also reflects expense of     $138     primarily related to non-deductible expenses. 
  The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   (8.2)%   is different when compared to the statutory federal rate of   35%     as a result of Federal and state valuation allowances recorded against operating losses. The income tax expenses of     $122     is primarily related to non-deductible expenses. 
  Adjusted operating income (loss) 
  The following is a reconciliation of operating loss to adjusted operating income:    

NM   Percentage is not meaningful 
  Adjusted operating income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $22,146  , or   93%  , to   $1,622   as compared to the prior year period.  The net   decrease   is attributable to the following: 

Other net decreases   reflect   (i) an increase in employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) the Company being subject to New York State and City capital tax during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and (iii) higher professional fees primarily associated with the Company s business development initiatives. The increase in employee compensation and related benefits was primarily a result of the Company operating as a standalone public company in the current year period and the absence of certain costs in the prior year period, based on accounting requirements for the preparation of carve-out financial statements. As such, certain costs reported in the combined statement of operations for the prior year period do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and do not reflect its combined results of operations had it been a separate, standalone

      Other net increases 
    289 

$ 
    33,672 

The increase in event-related revenues at The Garden was primarily due to a change in the mix of events and additional events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period.  
  The increase in revenues from the presentation of the   New York Spectacular   was driven by   56   scheduled performances presented in the current year period as compared to no scheduled performances in the prior year period. This was a result of the Company s decision to shift the timing of the production run from the spring to the summer.  
  The increase in event-related revenues at the Forum was primarily due to additional events and a change in the mix of events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
  The increase in event-related revenues at the other venues was primarily due to revenues   from BCE, which was acquired in July 2016, as well as   an increase in event-related revenues at The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Beacon Theatre and The Chicago Theatre primarily driven by additional events and the mix of events held at these venues during the current year period as compared to the prior year period.

The decrease in event-related revenues at Radio City Music Hall, excluding the   Christmas Spectacular   and the   New York Spectacular  , was primarily driven by the impact from the absence of NBC s   America s Got Talent  ,     which was presented at the venue during the prior year period. The decrease was partially offset by additional events and a change in the mix of events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
  Direct operating expenses 
  Direct operating expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $34,857  , or   61%  ,  to   $91,858   as compared to the prior year period. The net   increase   is attributable to the following:

    $ 
    34,857 

The increase in direct operating expenses from the presentation of the   New York Spectacular   was driven by   56   scheduled performances in the current year period as compared to no scheduled performances in the prior year period. This was a result of the Company s decision to shift the timing of the production run from the spring to the summer.  
  The increase in event-related direct operating expenses at The Garden was primarily due to a change in the mix of events held at the venue and, to a lesser extent, additional events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
  The increase in event-related direct operating expenses at the Forum was primarily due to additional events held at the venue and a change in the mix of events during the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
  The increase in event-related direct operating expenses at the other venues was primarily due to expenses   from BCE, which was acquired in July 2016, as well as   an increase in event-related operating expenses at The Theater at Madison Square Garden and The Chicago Theatre primarily driven by the mix of events and additional events held at these venues during the current year period as compared to the prior year period.  
  The decrease in event-related direct operating expenses at Radio City Music Hall, excluding the   Christmas Spectacular   and the   New York Spectacular  , was primarily due to fewer events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period.  This decrease was partially offset by a change in the mix of events held at the venue during the current year period as compared to the prior year period. 
  The decrease in venue operating costs was primarily due to lower labor-related costs at our venues in the current year period as compared to the prior year period.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $5,632  , or   32%  , to   $23,440   as compared to the prior year period. The increase mainly reflects higher (i) corporate general and administrative costs, (ii) employee compensation and related benefits, and (iii) professional fees.   The increase in corporate general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the Company operating as a standalone public company in the current year period and the absence of certain corporate general and administrative costs in the prior year period, based on accounting requirements for the preparation of carve-out financial statements. As such, selling, general and administrative expenses reported in the combined statement of operations for the prior year period do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and do not reflect its combined results of operations had it been a separate, standalone public company during the prior year period.

  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $3,553  , or   10%  , to   $39,513   as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher (i) employee compensation and related benefits, (ii) costs associated with the new advertising sales representation agreement with MSG Networks, that became effective on September 28, 2015, and (iii) corporate general and administrative costs, slightly offset by lower marketing and other expenses.   The increase in corporate general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the Company operating as a standalone public company in the current year period and the absence of certain corporate general and administrative costs in the prior year period, based on accounting requirements for the preparation of carve-out financial statements. As such, selling, general and administrative expenses reported in the combined statement of operations for the prior year period do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the Company and do not reflect its combined results of operations had it been a separate, standalone public company during the prior year period. See    Factors Affecting Results of Operations  for a discussion of the comparability of financial results. 
  Adjusted operating income 
  Adjusted operating income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $8,994  , or   37%  , to   $15,419  , as compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in direct operating expenses, lower revenues and higher selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above. 
  MSG Sports results for fiscal year 2017 will reflect the impact of higher revenues from the new NBA national media rights deal as well as higher team personnel compensation primarily due to the significant increase in the NBA s salary cap for the 2016-17 season.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Overview 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from the operations of our businesses and available borrowing capacity under our   $215,000   revolving credit agreements (see  Financing Agreements   Knicks Revolving Credit Facility  and  Financing Agreements   Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility  below). Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items, capital spending, investments and related loans that we may fund from time to time, and repurchases of shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. The decisions of the Company as to the use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. 
  The Company plans to continue to grow its live sports and entertainment business, both organically and through acquisition and development, including expanding its portfolio of venues and exploring investments in opportunities that range from new content to adjacencies that strengthen the Company s position in delivering premium live experiences. For example, in May 2016, the Company announced plans to build a new venue in Las Vegas which is anticipated to be   400,000   square feet and have   17,500   seats.   
  We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements. Over the next twelve months, we believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately   $1,294,000   in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016  , along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities combined with operating cash flows to fund our operations, pursue new business opportunities, including those discussed above, and repurchase shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock. As a result of the one-time tax payment made by MSG Networks related to the acceleration of taxable income on   $348,000   of the Company s deferred revenue in connection with the Distribution, the Company did not have to make cash income tax payments of approximately   $152,000   that would otherwise have been due for the prior fiscal year. This was a one-time event that will not recur. To the extent the Company desires to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, weak U.S. and global economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time. 
  On September 11, 2015, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $525,000   of the Company s Class A Common Stock once the shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock began  regular way  trading on October 1, 2015. Under the authorization, shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $347,009   of availability remaining under its stock repurchase authorization. 
  Financing Agreements    
  Knicks Revolving Credit Facility  
  On September 30, 2016,   Knicks LLC  , our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to   $200,000   with a term of   five   years to fund working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. 
  The   Knicks Revolving Credit Facility   requires   Knicks LLC   to comply with   a debt service ratio of 1.5:1.0 over a trailing four quarter period  . As of September 30, 2016,   Knicks LLC   was in compliance with this financial covenant.  
  All borrowings under the   Knicks Revolving Credit Facility   are subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including covenant compliance, accuracy of representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and absence of a default.    Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which at the option of Knicks LLC may be either (a) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.125% per annum or (b) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.125% per annum.   Knicks LLC is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from   0.20%   to   0.25%   per annum in respect of the average daily unused commitments under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility. The Knicks Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn as of September 30, 2016.  
  All obligations under the   Knicks Revolving Credit Facility   are secured by a first lien security interest in certain of Knicks LLC s assets, including, but not limited to, (a) the Knicks LLC s membership rights in the NBA and (b) revenues to be paid to the Knicks LLC by the NBA pursuant to certain U.S. national broadcast agreements.

Table of Contents  

Subject to customary notice and minimum amount conditions, Knicks LLC may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (except for customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency loans).   Knicks LLC is required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, including without limitation if the maximum available amount under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 350% of qualified revenues. 
  The Knicks Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictions on the ability of Knicks LLC to take certain actions as provided in (and subject to various exceptions and baskets set forth in) the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility, including the following: (i) incurring additional indebtedness and contingent liabilities; (ii) creating liens on certain assets; (iii) making restricted payments during the continuance of an event of default under the Knicks Revolving Credit Facility; (iv) engaging in sale and leaseback transactions; (v) merging or consolidating; and (vi) taking certain actions that would invalidate the secured lenders  liens on any Knicks LLC s collateral. 
  Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility  
  On September 30, 2016, Knicks LLC entered into an unsecured revolving credit with a lender for an initial maximum credit amount of   $15,000   and a   one  -year term. This facility was undrawn as of September 30, 2016. 
  Revolving Credit Facilities with Nonconsolidated Affiliates 
  In connection with the Company s investment in AMSGE, the Company provides a   $100,000   revolving credit facility to this entity, of which   $97,500   had been drawn as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  In connection with the Company s investment in Tribeca Enterprises, the Company provides a $13,500 revolving credit facility to this entity, of which   $13,103   is outstanding inclusive of   $95   of PIK interest as of   September 30, 2016  . PIK interest owed does not reduce availability under the revolving credit facility. The maximum capacity of the revolving facility may be increased by an additional   $2,500  , subject to certain conditions being met.  
  Bilateral Letters of Credit Line 
  The Company has established a bilateral credit line with a bank to issue letters of credit in support of the Company s business operations. Fees owed on outstanding letters of credit are credited against interest income the Company receives in return from its investments in notes receivable with the same bank. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were letters of credit for   $7,085   outstanding. 
   
  Cash Flow Discussion 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $1,294,081  , as compared to   $1,444,317   as of   June 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Operating Activities  
  Net cash used in operating activities   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   by   $19,904   to   $21,650   as compared to the prior year period largely driven by an increase in the current year period net loss partially offset by an increase in other non-cash items and, to a lesser extent, changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in operating cash flows from other non-cash items includes (i) an increase in share-based compensation expense, (ii) a loss in equity method investments in the current year period as compared to earnings in the prior year period partially offset by (iii) a benefit from deferred income taxes in the current year period. Changes in assets and liabilities were due to (i) a decrease in net related party receivables related to the programming rights agreements with MSG Networks partially offset by (ii) a decrease in deferred revenue due to timing and (iii) an increase in net related party payables due to MSG Networks associated with the advertising sales representation agreement as well as other changes in assets and liabilities.

Investing Activities  
  Net cash used in investing activities   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $22,071   to   $48,542   as compared to the prior year period largely driven by (i) lower capital expenditures primarily due to the purchase of a new aircraft during the prior year period, (ii) a decrease in the Company's acquisition of its interest in   cost method   investments and (iii) a decrease in outstanding loans to nonconsolidated affiliates under the revolving credit facilities offset by the acquisition of available-for-sale securities and a controlling interest in BCE during the current year period.  
  Financing Activities  
  Net cash used in financing activities   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $80,044   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in the prior year period of   $1,525,241  . This change is mainly due to net transfers from Former Parent which were primarily comprised of a $1,467,093 cash contribution during the prior year period and, to a lesser extent, repurchases of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock during the current year period.  
   
  Seasonality of Our Business 
  The dependence of the MSG Sports segment on revenues from its NBA and NHL sports teams generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues in the second and third quarters of the Company s fiscal year. The dependence of the MSG Entertainment segment on revenues from the   Christmas Spectacular     generally means it earns a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income in the second quarter of the Company s fiscal year.  
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note   2   to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in  Part I   Item 1. Financial Statements  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the first quarter of fiscal year   2017  . There have been no material changes to  the Company s critical accounting policies from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31   st    and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.  The Company s two reporting units for evaluating goodwill impairment are the same as its reportable segments and both of them have goodwill.  The goodwill balance reported on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   by reportable segment is as follows:    

During the first quarter of fiscal year   2017  , the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill identified   for either of its reporting units  .  
  The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for the MSG Sports reporting unit. This assessment considered factors such as:   
             
    macroeconomic conditions; 
                
    industry and market considerations; 
                
    cost factors; 
                
    overall financial performance of the reporting unit; 
                
    other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and 
                
    relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. 
     
   34 

Table of Contents  

The Company performed the quantitative assessment of impairment for the MSG Entertainment reporting unit. The estimate of the fair value of the MSG Entertainment reporting unit was primarily determined using discounted projected future cash flows.  For MSG Entertainment, this valuation includes assumptions for the number and expected financial performance of live entertainment events and productions, which include, but are not limited to, the level of ticket sales, concessions and sponsorships. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow valuation include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and the identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. 
  Based on these impairment tests, the Company s reporting units had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). The Company believes that if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.  
  Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
  Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31   st    and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   by reportable segment:    

During the first quarter of fiscal year   2017  , the Company performed its annual impairment test of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that there were no impairments identified. Based on results of the impairment tests performed, the Company s indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset's estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.  
   
  Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There were no material changes to the disclosures regarding market risks in connection with our pension and postretirement plans, foreign currency risk exposure and commodity risk exposures. See Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  .  
  The following is an update to our potential interest rate risk exposure:  
  We have potential interest rate risk exposure related to borrowings incurred under our   Knicks Revolving Credit Facility   and   Knicks Unsecured Credit Facility   collectively, the    Knicks Credit Facilities  .  Changes in U.S. interest rates may increase interest expense paid with respect to any borrowings incurred under the   Knicks Credit Facilities  . 
  Borrowings under our   Knicks Credit Facilities   incur interest, depending on our election, at a floating rate based upon LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Funds Rate or the U.S. Prime Rate, plus, in each case, a fixed spread. If appropriate, we may seek to reduce such exposure through the use of interest rate swaps or similar instruments. See    Item 2  .   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Financing Agreements    for more information on our   Knicks Credit Facilities  . We currently have no interest rate risk exposure as we have no debt outstanding.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
  The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In addition, no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
