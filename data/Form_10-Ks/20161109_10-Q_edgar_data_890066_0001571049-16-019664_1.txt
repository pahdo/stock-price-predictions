NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying condensed
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore,
do not include all information and notes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders  equity, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. However, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for a fair presentation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been included in the results of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Operating results for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings per
share of common stock are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by including the average dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during
the periods. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method. 

Diluted earnings per
share calculations were not required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, since there were no options
outstanding. 

NOTE 3   LOANS AND ASSET
QUALITY  

Asset Quality .
The following tables set forth the amount of the Bank s current, past due, and non-accrual loans by categories of loans and
restructured loans, at the dates indicated. 

The balances in the
above charts have not been reduced by the allowance for loan loss and the unearned income on loans. For the period ending September
30, 2016, the allowance for loan loss is $2,315,000 and the unearned income is $1,008,000. For the period ending December 31, 2015,
the allowance for loan loss is $3,150,000 and the unearned income is $1,071,000. 

At September 30, 2016
there were three troubled debt restructured loans consisting of a commercial loan of $232,000, a residential real estate loan of
$49,000 and a consumer loan of $37,000. The consumer loan was restructured during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and is currently
on nonaccrual. The commercial loan had a troubled debt restructured balance of $241,000 and the residential real estate loan had
a balance of $49,000 at December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016,
there was $1,185,000 in loans outstanding, included in the current and 30-89 days past due columns in the above table, as to which
known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers
to comply with present loan repayment terms. Such loans consist of loans which were not 90 days or more past due but where the
borrower is in bankruptcy or has a history of delinquency, or the loan to value ratio is considered excessive due to deterioration
of the collateral or other factors. The three loans outstanding, totaling $1,185,000, are as follows: $786,000 Commercial Real
Estate loan where the guarantor is in bankruptcy and the loan has an accelerated payoff since we have an assignment of rents from
the property which has a very long-term national tenant; $167,000 Home Equity Line of Credit which is paying as agreed, however
the borrower has defaulted on other commercial loans which have been satisfied; and a $232,000 Commercial loan with a loan to value
ratio which has deteriorated, which has a complete specific reserve of $232,000. All three of these loans are classified with a
risk rating of Substandard. 

Non-accrual loans with
specific reserves at September 30, 2016 are comprised of: 

Consumer loans 
  Two loans to two borrowers in the amount of $134,000 with a specific reserve of $54,000 established for the loans. 

Commercial Real Estate 
  One loan to a borrower in the amount of $290,000, secured by commercial and/or residential properties with a specific reserve
of $109,000 established for the loan. 

Residential Real Estate 
  Two loans to two borrowers in the amount of $79,000, secured by residential property with a specific reserve of $18,000
established for the loan. 

Below is a summary of the recorded investment
amount and related allowance for losses of the Bank s impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Credit Quality Information 

The
following tables represent credit exposures by creditworthiness category for the quarter ending  September 30, 2016  and
the year ended December 31, 2015. The use of creditworthiness categories to grade loans permits management to estimate a portion
of credit risk. The Bank s internal creditworthiness is based on experience with similarly graded credits. Loans that trend
upward toward higher credit grades typically have less credit risk and loans that migrate downward typically have more credit risk.

The Bank s internal risk
ratings are as follows: 

1  Superior   minimal risk (normally supported by pledged deposits, United States government securities, etc.)   

2  Above Average   low risk. (all of the risks associated with this credit based on each of the bank s creditworthiness
criteria are minimal)   

3  Average   moderately low risk. (most of the risks associated with this credit based on each of the bank s creditworthiness
criteria are minimal)   

4  Acceptable   moderate risk. (the weighted overall risk associated with this credit based on each of the bank s
creditworthiness criteria is acceptable)   

5  Other Assets Especially Mentioned   moderately high risk. (possesses deficiencies which corrective action by the bank
would remedy; potential watch list)   

6  Substandard   (the bank is inadequately protected and there exists the distinct possibility of sustaining some loss if
not corrected)   

7  Doubtful   (weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, improbable)   

8  Loss   (of little value; not warranted as a bankable asset)   

Loans rated 1-4 are considered  Pass 
for purposes of the risk rating chart below. 

Risk ratings of loans
by categories of loans are as follows: 

NOTE 4   FAIR VALUE  

ASC 820-10 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 

Fair Value Hierarchy  

ASC
820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or
unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities  

Level 2   Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar securities)  

Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)  

In determining the appropriate levels, the
Company performs a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820-10. 

The Company s
bond holdings in the investment securities portfolio are the only asset or liability subject to fair value measurements on a recurring
basis. At September 30, 2016, these assets include 25 loans, excluding $408,000 of consumer and indirect loans, classified as impaired,
which include nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and a homogeneous pool of indirect loans all considered
to be impaired loans, which are valued under Level 3 inputs. Loans which are deemed to be impaired ($3.7 million of loans with
$413,000 of specific reserves as of September 30, 2016) and foreclosed real estate assets are primarily valued on a nonrecurring
basis at the fair values of the underlying real estate collateral. The Company is predominantly a cash flow lender with real estate
serving as collateral on a majority of loans ($3.0 million of the total impaired loans as of September 30, 2016). On a quarterly
basis, the Company determines such fair values through a variety of data points and mostly rely on appraisals from independent
appraisers. We obtain an appraisal on properties when they become impaired and have new appraisals at least every year. Typically,
these appraisals do not include an inside inspection of the property as our loan documents do not require the borrower to allow
access to the property. Therefore the most significant unobservable inputs is the details of the amenities included within the
property and the condition of the property. Further, we cannot always accurately assess the amount of time it takes to gain ownership
of our collateral through the foreclosure process and the damage, as well as potential looting, of the property further decreasing
our value. Thus, in determining the fair values we discount the current independent appraisals, with a range from 0% to 16%, based
on individual circumstances. The remaining impaired loans ($641,000 with $286,000 of specific reserves as of September 30, 2016)
include mobile homes, commercial, consumer, and indirect auto loans, which are valued based on the value of the underlying collateral. 

The changes in the assets subject to fair
value measurements are summarized below by Level: 

The estimated fair
values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below. The fair
values of a significant portion of these financial instruments are estimates derived using present value techniques and may not
be indicative of the net realizable or liquidation values. Also, the calculation of estimated fair values is based on market conditions
at a specific point in time and may not reflect current or future fair values. 

The following presents
the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments. 

Fair values are based
on quoted market prices for similar instruments or estimated using discounted cash flows. The discounts used are estimated using
comparable market rates for similar types of instruments adjusted to be commensurate with the credit risk, overhead costs and optionality
of such instruments. 

The fair value of cash
and due from banks, federal funds sold, investments in restricted stocks and accrued interest receivable are equal to the carrying
amounts. The fair values of investment securities are determined using market quotations. The fair value of loans receivable is
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis. 

The fair value of non-interest
bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts, securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
and accrued interest payable are equal to the carrying amounts. The fair value of fixed-maturity time deposits is estimated using
discounted cash flow analysis. 

The gross unrealized
losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

Declines in the fair
value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected
in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary-impairment losses, management considers, among other things,
(i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer, and (iii) the intent and ability of the Company to retain it s investment in the issuer for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. 

As of September 30,
2016, management had the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as available for sale for a period of time sufficient
for a recovery of cost. On September 30, 2016, the Bank held 16 investment securities having continuous unrealized loss positions
for more than 12 months. Management has determined that all unrealized losses are either due to increases in market interest rates
over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased, current call features that are nearing, and the
effect the sub-prime market has had on all mortgage-backed securities. The Bank has no mortgage-backed securities collateralized
by sub-prime mortgages. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if
market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit
quality. Except as noted above, as of September 30, 2016, management believes the impairments detailed in the table above are temporary
and no impairment loss has been recognized in the Company s consolidated income statement. 

A rollforward of the
cumulative other-than-temporary credit losses recognized in earnings for all debt securities for which a portion of an other-than-temporary
loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:

NOTE 5   RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS  

The FASB has issued
several exposure drafts which, if adopted, would significantly alter the Company s (and all other financial institutions )
method of accounting for, and reporting, its financial assets and some liabilities from a historical cost method to a fair value
method of accounting as well as the reported amount of net interest income. The Company has not determined the extent of the possible
changes at this time. The exposure drafts are in different stages of review, approval and possible adoption. 

In May 2014, the FASB
issued  ASU 2014 - 09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU 2014-09 implements a common
revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity
should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the
contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Corporation
on January 1, 2017. The Corporation is still evaluating the potential impact on the Corporation's financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB
and the International Accounting Standards Board (the  IASB ) jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition
standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards ( IFRS ). Previous revenue recognition guidance in GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together
with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting
for economically similar transactions. In contrast, IFRS provided limited revenue recognition guidance and, consequently, could
be difficult to apply to complex transactions. Accordingly, the FASB and the IASB initiated a joint project to clarify the principles
for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS that would: (1) Remove inconsistencies
and weaknesses in revenue requirements; (2) Provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; (3) Improve comparability
of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; (4) Provide more useful information
to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and (5) Simplify the preparation of financial statements
by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. To meet those objectives, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue
from Contracts with Customers.   The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when
it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies generally will be required to use more judgment
and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating
the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation. The standard is now effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017; early adoption is not permitted. For financial reporting purposes, the standard allows for either full retrospective
adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard
is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the standard recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09
and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have
on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In June 2014, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance
Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.   The amendments in the ASU require that a performance
target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation , as it relates to
awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The performance target should not be reflected
in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes
probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s)
for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before
the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the
remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period
should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest.
The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the
performance target is achieved. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either: (1) prospectively to all
awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (2) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding
as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
As of June 30, 2014, the Company did not have any share-based payment awards that include performance targets that could be achieved
after the requisite service period. As such, the adoption of ASU No. 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In June 2014, the FASB
issued  ASU 2014-11,  Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860).   ASU 2014-11 requires that repurchase-to-maturity
transactions be accounted for as secured borrowings consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements. In addition,
ASU 2014-11 requires separate accounting for repurchase financings, which entails the transfer of a financial asset executed
contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty. ASU 2014-11 requires entities to disclose certain
information about transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically similar to repurchase agreements. In addition,
ASU 2014-11 requires disclosures related to collateral, remaining contractual tenor and of the potential risks associated
with repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and repurchase-to-maturity transactions. ASU 2014-11 became effective
for us on January 1, 2015 and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In January 2015, the
FASB issued  ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying Income
Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.   ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S.
GAAP the concept of extraordinary items, which, among other things, required an entity to segregate extraordinary items considered
to be unusual and infrequent from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net
of tax, after income from continuing operations. ASU 2015-01 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2016, though early
adoption is permitted. ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In February 2015, the
FASB issued  ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810)   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   ASU 2015-02
implements changes to both the variable interest consolidation model and the voting interest consolidation model. ASU 2015-02
(i) eliminates certain criteria that must be met when determining when fees paid to a decision maker or service provider do
not represent a variable interest, (ii) amends the criteria for determining whether a limited partnership is a variable interest
entity and (iii)  eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership in the voting model. ASU 2015-02
will be effective for us on January 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In April 2015, the
FASB issued  ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs .    ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03
will be effective for us on January 1, 2016, though early adoption is permitted. ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have
a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In May 2015, the FASB
issued  ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)   Customer s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   ASU 2015-05 addresses accounting for fees paid
by a customer in cloud computing arrangements such as (i) software as a service, (ii) platform as a service (iii) infrastructure
as a service and (iv) other similar hosting arrangements. ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud
computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer
should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service
contract. ASU 2015-05 will be effective for us on January 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on
our financial statements. 

In May 2015, the FASB
issued  ASU 2015-09,  Financial Services-Insurance: Disclosures About Short-Duration Contracts.   ASU 2015-09
requires entities to provide additional disclosures about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses to increase
the transparency of significant estimates. ASU 2015-09 also requires entities to disclose information about significant changes
in methodologies and assumption used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, including reasons
for the change and the effects on the financial statements. ASU 2015-09 also requires entities to disclose a rollforward of the
liability of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense for annual and interim reporting periods. The effective date of ASU 2015-09
is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods within annual period beginning
after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or
results of operations. 

In August 2015,
the FASB issued  ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date  .
ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers which supersedes the
revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition  by one year. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that
revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure
about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Under ASU 2015-14,
ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and disclosures, if any. 

In August 2015,
the FASB issued  ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit
Arrangements .  ASU 2015-15 expands guidance provided in ASU 2015-03 and states that presentation of costs associated
with securing a revolving line of credit as an asset is permitted, regardless of whether or not the line of credit is funded. ASU
2015-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15,
2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-15 on its financial statements
and disclosures, if any. 

In September 2015,
the FASB issued  ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . 
ASU 2015-16 simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in a business combination by requiring the acquirer to
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments
are determined, thereby eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The acquirer is also
required to record in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation,
amortization, and other items resulting from the change to the provisional amounts. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 31, 2015, with early application permitted, and shall apply to adjustments to provisional amounts
that occur after the effective date.  ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have any significant impact on our financial statements. 

In January 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-1,  No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-1, among other things, (i) requires equity investments, with
certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment
assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment,
(iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv)
requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair
value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the
liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying
notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred
tax asset related to available-for-sale. ASU 2016-1 will be effective for us on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to
have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-02  Leases (Topic 842).   ASU 2016-02 will, among other things, require lessees
to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use
of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable
to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and
ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2016-2 will be effective for us on January 1,
2019 and will require transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-05  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge
Accounting Relationships.   ASU 2016-05  clarifies  that a change in the counterparty to a derivative
instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation
of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  ASU 2016-05  will
be effective for us on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-07,  Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the
Equity Method of Accounting.   The amendments affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified
for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. ASU 2016-07
simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting by eliminating retroactive adjustment of the investment when an investment
qualifies for use of the equity method, among other things. ASU 2016-07 will be effective for us on January 1, 2017 and
is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   ASU 2016-08 was issued to clarify certain principal versus agent considerations
within the implementation guidance of  ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The
effective date and transition of ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date and transition of  ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , as discussed above. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
of ASU 2016-08 on our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting.   Under ASU 2016-09 all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based
payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement during the period in which they occur.
Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess tax benefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool
was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer recognized in additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying
the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share should exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously
been recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax
cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides
that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to
vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 changes the threshold to qualify for equity classification
(rather than as a liability) to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates (rather than the minimum as was previously
the case) in the applicable jurisdictions. ASU 2016-09 will be effective on January 1, 2017 and is currently not expected
to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

In April 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing.   ASU 2016-10 was issued to clarify  ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers   related to (i) identifying performance obligations; and (ii) the licensing implementation
guidance. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date and transition of  ASU
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   as discussed above. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-10 on our financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB
issued  ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope and Practical Expedients  
which updated guidance intended to clarify the guidance previously issued in May 2014 related to the recognition of revenue from
contracts with customers. The updated guidance includes narrow-scope improvements intended to address implementation
issues and to provide additional practical expedients in the guidance. The updated guidance is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact
on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB
issued  ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments   which updated guidance intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information
about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at
each reporting date. The updated guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects
expected credit losses and requires the consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit
loss estimates.  The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-15 ,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ).  This Accounting Standards Update addresses the following eight specific cash flow
issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with
coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method
investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance
principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not
expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Overview  

Glen Burnie Bancorp,
a Maryland corporation (the  Company ), through its subsidiary, The Bank of Glen Burnie, a Maryland banking corporation
(the  Bank ), operates a commercial bank with eight offices in Anne Arundel County Maryland. The Company had consolidated
net income of $115,000 ($0.04 basic and diluted earnings per share) for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter
of 2015 consolidated net income of $8,000 ($0.00 basic and diluted income per share), a 1,337.50% increase. Year-to-date net income
was $706,000 ($0.25 basic and diluted earnings per share), compared to the 2015 consolidated net income of $906,000 ($0.33 basic
and diluted income per share), a 22.08% decrease. Despite net interest income after provision for credit losses being better in
the current year and maintaining level total operating expenses, net income declined in the current year because non-interest income,
mostly non-recurring, was much greater in the prior comparable period. In the quarter ending June 30, 2015, the Company realized
$430,000 on the redemption of insurance policies (recorded as  other non-interest income  in the Company s Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income) and $469,000 on the sale of securities as compared to only $1,000 on the sale of securities
in the current year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, deposits increased by $478,000 and net loans decreased by
$1,858,000. 

Results
Of Operations   

Net Interest Income .
The Company s consolidated net interest income prior to provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $2,792,000 and $8,324,000, respectively, compared to $2,808,000 and $8,435,000, respectively, for the same period
in 2015, a decrease of $16,000 (0.57%) for the three months and a decrease of $111,000 (1.32%) for the nine months. 

Interest income for
the third quarter decreased from $3,396,000 in 2015 to $3,318,000 in 2016, a 2.30% decrease. Interest income for the nine months
decreased from $10,250,000 in 2015 to $9,938,000 in 2016, a 3.05% decrease. The primary reason for the decline in interest income
for the 2016 period when compared to the 2015 period was the decline in loan income as both yields and balances declined and a
decrease in interest income for state and municipal securities, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government
agency securities. 

Interest expense for
the third quarter decreased from $588,000 in 2015 to $526,000 in 2016, a 10.55% decrease. Interest expense for the nine months
decreased from $1,815,000 in 2015 to $1,614,000 in 2016, an 11.08% decrease. Interest expense for the third quarter and nine months
of year 2016 was lower than the comparable periods of 2015 primarily due to the decrease in rates paid on our deposits. 

Net interest margins
on a tax equivalent basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.17% and 3.15%, compared to 3.23% and 3.22%
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of the net interest margin for both periods was primarily
due to declining yields on earning assets, as loan balances and yields have continued to decline and the balances of lower yielding
investment securities have continued to increase within the portfolio. 

Provision for Credit
Losses . The Company made a provision for credit losses of $116,000 and $233,000 during the three and nine month periods ending
September 30, 2016, and $985,000 and $1,285,000 during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015. As of September
30, 2016, the allowance for credit losses equaled 91.57% of non-accrual and past due loans compared to 82.14% at December 31, 2015
and 68.81% at September 30, 2015. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net charge-offs
of $93,000 and $1,070,000, of which $685,000 was held as specific reserves at December 31, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of
$1,166,000 and $1,310,00 during the corresponding period of the prior year. The majority of the  $ 1,070,000 of charge-offs
during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was to one relationship, pertaining to nine loans, which were performing loans
(less than 90 days delinquent) and classified as  Substandard  as of December 31, 2015 with $685,000 of specific reserves.
As of September 30, 2016, the loans included in this relationship remained in non-accrual status and classified as  Substandard . 

Other Income .
Other income decreased from $663,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, to $349,000 for the corresponding 2016
period, a $314,000 (47.36%) decrease. Other income decreased from $2,239,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015,
to $974,000 for the corresponding 2016 period, a $1,265,000 (56.50%) decrease. The decrease for the three and nine month periods
was primarily due to a decrease in gains on investment securities, with lesser decreases in service charges and other fees. The
decrease of the nine months was also due to a non-recurring gain on the redemption of insurance policies of $421,000 taken during
the second quarter of 2015. 

Other Expenses .
Other expenses increased from $2,655,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015, to $2,965,000 for the corresponding
2016 period, a $310,000 (11.68%) increase. The increase for the three month period was due to severance costs related to the elimination
of the Chief Operating Officer position and other expenses. Other expenses decreased from $8,343,000 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015, to $8,336,000 for the corresponding 2016 period, a $7,000 (0.09%) decrease. The decrease for the nine
month period was due mainly to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits (salaries decreased even with the severance costs noted
above), offset by an increase in other expenses. 

Income Taxes .
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an income tax (benefit) expense of ($55,000) and
$23,000, respectively, compared to income tax (benefit) expense of ($177,000) and $140,000 for the same respective periods in 2015.
The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods in 2016 was (91.67%) and 3.16%, respectively, compared
to (104.73%) and 13.39%, respectively, for the prior year period. The decreases in the effective tax rate for the three and nine
month periods were due to higher 2015 period income from gains on investment securities and non-recurring redemptions of insurance
policies. Income tax expense for 2015 was further increased by the payment of an additional $66,000 to the Comptroller of Maryland
for unentitled refunds from 2004 and 2007. 

Comprehensive Income.
  In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Company reports comprehensive income in its financial statements. Comprehensive
income consists of the Company s net income, adjusted for unrealized gains and losses on the Bank s investment portfolio
of investment securities. For the third quarter of 2016, comprehensive losses, net of tax, totaled ($189,000 ) , compared
to the September 30, 2015 comprehensive income, net of tax benefit, of $543,000. Year-to-date, comprehensive income, net of tax,
totaled $1,498,000, compared to the September 30, 2015 comprehensive income, net of tax, of $724,000. The decrease for the three
month period was due to the third quarter having a decrease in the unrealized holding gains from the second quarter. The increase
for the nine month period was due to an increase in the gains on the securities in the portfolio. 

Financial
Condition   

General.  The
Company s assets increased to $392,152,000 at September 30, 2016 from $390,580,000 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to
an increase in cash and cash equivalents, offset by a decrease in loans. The Bank s net loans totaled $257,779,000 at September
30, 2016, compared to $259,637,000 at December 31, 2015 ,  a decrease of $1,858,000 (0.72%), primarily attributable to a decrease
in refinance loans, purchase money mortgage, business installment secured loans and smaller decreases in various other loan categories.
These decreases were partially offset by increases in indirect, SBA loans and various other loan categories. 

The Company s
total investment securities portfolio (investment securities available for sale) totaled $98,532,000 at September 30, 2016, a $258,000
(0.27%) decrease from $98,790,000 at December 31, 2015. The Bank s cash and due from banks (cash due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits in other financial institutions, and federal funds sold), as of September 30, 2016, totaled $16,676,000, an increase of
$4,305,000 (34.80%) from the December 31, 2015 total of $12,371,000. The increase in investment securities was funded by the decrease
in loans and increase in deposits. 

Deposits as of September
30, 2016 totaled $335,669,000, which is an increase of $478,000 (0.14%) from $335,191,000 at December 31, 2015. Demand deposits
as of September 30, 2016, totaled $100,634,000, which is an increase of $7,049,000 (7.53%) from $93,585,000 at December 31, 2015.
NOW accounts as of September 30, 2016, totaled $29,791,000, which is an increase of $2,289,000 (8.32%) from $27,502,000 at December
31, 2015. Money market accounts as of September 30, 2016, totaled $17,922,000, which is a decrease of $1,158,000 (6.07%), from
$19,080,000 at December 31, 2015. Savings deposits as of September 30, 2016, totaled $79,322,000, which is an increase of $1,214,000
(1.55%) from $78,108,000 at December 31, 2015. Certificates of deposit over $100,000 totaled $31,678,000 on September 30, 2016,
which is a decrease of $2,561,000 (7.48%) from $34,239,000 at December 31, 2015. Other time deposits (made up of certificates of
deposit less than $100,000 and individual retirement accounts) totaled $76,321,000 on September 30, 2016, which is a $6,357,000
(7.69%) decrease from the $82,678,000 total at December 31, 2015. 

Loans . The following
tables set forth the amount of the Bank s loans by categories at the dates indicated. 

The Bank s net
loans totaled $257,779,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to $259,637,000 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1,858,000 (0.72%).
Residential real estate loans declined from $116.0 million to $109.3 million ($6.7 million or 5.78%) primarily due to loans refinancing
to lower their current interest rates. Commercial real estate loans increased from $62.5 million to $63.2 million ($682,000 or
1.09%) as the loan originations outpaced the loans paying off. 

Other Real Estate
Owned.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had $0 in real estate acquired in partial or total satisfaction of debt, compared
to $74,400 at December 31, 2015. All such properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value (net realizable value) at
the date acquired and carried on the balance sheet as other real estate owned. Losses arising at the date of acquisition are charged
against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent write-downs that may be required and expense of operation are included in non-interest
expense. Gains and losses realized from the sale of other real estate owned are included in non-interest income or expense. 

Allowance For Credit
Losses . The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are
charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely.
The allowance, based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience, is an amount that management
believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The evaluations are performed
for each class of loans and take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall
portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, value of collateral securing the loans and current economic conditions and
trends that may affect the borrowers  ability to pay. For example, delinquencies in unsecured loans and indirect automobile
installment loans will be reserved for at significantly higher ratios than loans secured by real estate. Based on that analysis,
the Bank deems its allowance for credit losses in proportion to the total non-accrual loans and past due loans to be sufficient. 

Transactions in the allowance for credit
losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses included an unallocated portion in the amount of $106,000 and $148,000,
respectively. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses is available to absorb further losses that may not necessarily
be accounted for in the current model. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is at an appropriate level to absorb
inherent probable losses in the portfolio. 

During 2016, loans
to 64 borrowers and related entities totaling approximately $1,378,000 were determined to be uncollectible and were charged off. 

Reserve for Unfunded
Commitments . As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had outstanding commitments totaling $26,651,000. These outstanding commitments
consisted of letters of credit, undrawn lines of credit, and other loan commitments. The following table shows the Bank s
reserve for unfunded commitments arising from these transactions: 

Contractual Obligations
and Commitments.  No material changes, outside the normal course of business, have been made during the third quarter of 2016. 

Market Risk and Interest
Rate Sensitivity   

Market risk is the
risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange
rates or equity pricing. The Company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending, investing
and deposit taking activities. The Company s profitability is dependent on the Bank s net interest income. Interest
rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different
intervals than interest earning assets. The Bank s Asset/Liability and Risk Management Committee oversees the management
of interest rate risk. The primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes
due to interest rate fluctuations. The Company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies
in its management of interest rate risk. The primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a  gap 
report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subject
to repricing within a given time period. These efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the Company as well
as the asset mix, volume guidelines, and liquidity and capital planning. 

The following table sets forth the Company s
interest-rate sensitivity at September 30, 2016. 

The foregoing analysis
assumes that the Company s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final
maturity. Mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed
that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts are presumed to reprice
at maturity. NOW savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the Company s experience that
such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates. 

In addition to GAP
analysis, the Bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus 200 basis point change
in rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity. The model takes into consideration the effect of call
features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates. When actual changes in interest rates occur,
the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model. As of
September 30, 2016, the model produced the following sensitivity profile for net interest income and the economic value of equity. 

Inasmuch as a large
portion of the Company s deposits are non-interest bearing in an increased interest rate environment the Company s
interest income increases at a proportionally greater rate than its total interest expense, thereby resulting in higher net interest
income.  Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment the decreases in the Company s interest income will be
greater than decreases in its already low interest expense, thereby resulting in lower net interest income..  The Company s
economic value of equity has a positive effect in an increased interest rate environment for shocks of 200 basis points and less
because the increase in economic value of the Company s liabilities is greater than the decline in value of the Company s
assets because the liabilities reprice much slower than our assets, especially considering our interest earning assets are much
greater than our interest bearing liabilities.  For an interest rate shock of 300 basis points economic and above produce
results whereby the change in economic value of equity is worse.  The Company s economic value of equity worsens in
declining interest rate environments as the majority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease much from their current levels
thus the economic value of our liabilities and our assets both worsen in a declining rate environment. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The Company currently
has no business other than that of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments. The Company s principal
sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions
on the payment of dividends. 

The Bank s principal
sources of funds for investments and operations are net income, deposits from its primary market area, principal and interest payments
on loans, interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities. Its principal funding commitments
are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits. Deposits are considered a primary source of
funds supporting the Bank s lending and investment activities. 

The Bank s most
liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which are cash on hand, amounts due from financial institutions, federal funds sold,
certificates of deposit with other financial institutions that have an original maturity of three months or less and money market
mutual funds. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank s operating, financing and investment activities at any
given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit
flows. The Bank s cash and cash equivalents (cash due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions,
and federal funds sold), as of September 30, 2016, totaled $16,676,000, an increase of $4,305,000 (34.80%) from the December 31,
2015 total of $12,371,000. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Bank was permitted to draw on a $67,787,000 line of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. Borrowings under the line are secured
by a floating lien on the Bank s residential mortgage loans. At September 30, 2016, there was nothing outstanding in short-term
borrowings from FHLB. As of September 30, 2016, there were $20.0 million in long-term convertible advances outstanding with various
monthly and quarterly call features and with final maturities through August 2018. In addition, the Bank has three unsecured federal
funds lines of credit in the amount of $3.0 million, $5.0 million and $8.0 million ,  of which nothing was outstanding as
of September 30, 2016. 

The Company s
stockholders  equity increased $785,000 (2.30%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due mainly to an increase
in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes. The Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
of taxes increased by $791,000 (262.79%) from ($301,000) at December 31, 2015 to $490,000 at September 30, 2016, as a result of
an increase in the market value of securities classified as available for sale. Retained earnings decreased by $127,000 (0.58%)
as the result of the Company s net income for the nine months, offset by dividends. 

The Federal Reserve
Board and the FDIC have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by bank holding
companies and state non-member banks, respectively. The regulations impose two sets of capital adequacy requirements: minimum leverage
rules, which require bank holding companies and banks to maintain a specified minimum ratio of capital to total assets, and risk-based
capital rules, which require the maintenance of specified minimum ratios of capital to  risk-weighted  assets. At September
30, 2016, the Bank was in full compliance with these guidelines with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.5831%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of 13.7423%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 13.7423%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.6936%. 

Current
Outlook   

The Bank s results
of operations continue to be affected by the low interest rate environment and slow recovering economy. As a result, net interest
income for the periods ended September 30, 2016 is lower than net interest income for the comparable 2015 period. Future results
of operation depend greatly on the overall economy, actions of the Federal Reserve Board and other factors beyond the Bank s
control, and the Bank cannot accurately forecast these factors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The Company s
accounting policies are more fully described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and
are essential to understanding Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As
discussed there, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty, the determination of
estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary
to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
financial statements. The Company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual results have
not differed significantly from the Company s estimates. The following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates
and principles involved in the preparation of the Company s financial statements, including the identification of the variables
most important in the estimation process: 

Allowance for Credit
Losses.  The Bank s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual
events occur, including historical losses as an indicator of future losses, fair market value of collateral, and various general
or industry or geographic specific economic events.  The use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the
actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.  For further information regarding the Bank s allowance for
credit losses, see  Allowance for Credit Losses , above. 

Accrued Taxes. 
Management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities. Accrued taxes represent
the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the relative
merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance
in the context of the Company s tax position. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company maintains
a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. The Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated this system of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report, and have concluded that the system is effective. There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND
GENERAL RELEASE 

This Confidential Severance Agreement and
General Release ( Agreement ) is entered into this 1 st  day of September, 2016, by  EDWARD CONNELLY  ( Employee )
and  THE BANK OF GLEN BURNIE , its parent corporation, its related entities, affiliates, subsidiaries, divisions, predecessors,
successors, assigns, employees, officers, directors, shareholders and agents ( the Bank ) to settle and resolve any
claims or controversies the Bank and the Employee may have against each other. 

NOW, THEREFORE,  the parties hereto
agree as follows: 

1.            Elimination
of Position.   Due to business reasons, the Bank is eliminating Employee s position and thus, terminating Employee,
effective September 1, 2016 (the  Termination Date ). 

2.            Severance.   In consideration
of the releases and other terms set forth in this Agreement, the Bank will pay Employee a total gross severance amount equivalent
to one year s salary, in the amount of $182,456.56, payable in bi-weekly payments of $7,017.56, less deductions, in accordance
with the Bank s customary payroll practices. The payment period is from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017. These
severance payments will be paid after deducting applicable federal, state, and local taxes and other applicable payroll deductions
and withholdings, except for health and dental deductions which must be paid if COBRA is elected in accordance with Section 3. 

3.            Health Insurance  .
Employee s health insurance will terminate effective September 30, 2016. Employee will be eligible for continuation of his
health insurance coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) for 18 months, or such
other time as designated by COBRA, provided he timely makes all premium payments required under COBRA. 

4.            Confidential
Information   .  Employee agrees to hold in strictest confidence and will not, without the prior written approval of
the Bank, knowingly disclose to any person or entity (other than as required by law) the Bank s  Confidential Information. 
 Confidential Information  shall include the Bank s (1) specific financial information that has not otherwise
been made public; (2) financial information about the Bank s customers, and (3) any other information of or relating to the
Bank or its customers that: (a) has been kept strictly confidential by the Bank; and (b) has not been disclosed to any third party
except under an obligation of confidentiality; and (c) is or was not otherwise available in the public domain. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this section does not prohibit Employee from disclosing Confidential Information to a federal, state or local government
official or to an attorney for the purpose of reporting or investigating a violation of law or in a court filing under seal. 

Employee further agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of this Agreement and agrees to refrain from disclosing to any third party (except as required by law) the contents of this Agreement,
except to his spouse, tax advisor, or an attorney with whom Employee chooses to consult regarding his consideration of this Agreement.
Employee further agrees not to visit any employees at the Bank or make any other contact with any employees of the Bank regarding
his employment, and/or this Agreement. In the event that he or his agents, representatives or attorneys are compelled by subpoena
or otherwise to provide Confidential Information, he will provide the Bank with not less than five (5) days  written notice,
where possible, so that the Bank has the opportunity to seek appropriate protection from a court of competent jurisdiction. 

5.            Return
of Property and Transition.   Employee will promptly return to the Bank, without retaining copies, all tangible items, including,
without limitation, all reports, computer records, computer disks, building keys, and any and all other property of the Bank that
is currently in the possession of or under the control of Employee. 

6.            Breach of the Agreement.  
Employee agrees that the breach or failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Bank,
for which monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy. Employee agrees that in the event of any breach of the terms of
this Agreement, the Bank shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to such other legal and equitable remedies that may
be available, without the necessity of posting any bond or other security. 

If Employee breaches any of his obligations
under this Agreement, including the agreement not to sue, Employee agrees to return any and all severance payments provided to
Employee, pursuant to Paragraph 2 of this Agreement, and the Bank will make no further payments to Employee under this Agreement.
This provision, however, will not have any impact on Employee s right to receive COBRA coverage at Employee s sole
expense. Employee acknowledges that in addition to the return of all severance payments, the Bank has a right to seek any other
monetary relief it may be entitled to under this Agreement or applicable law, due to Employee s breach. However, Employee
is not obligated to return any severance payments if Employee files a lawsuit against the Bank claiming a violation of this Agreement
or exercises any of his rights as specified in Paragraph 9 of this Agreement. 

7.            Complete
Release by Employee.   Employee, for himself, and on behalf of his agents, executors, heirs, representatives, and successors,
knowingly and voluntarily releases and forever discharges the Bank and each of its past and present employees, agents, officers,
directors and shareholders (each an  Employer Released Party  and together the  Employer Released Parties )
from any claims, charges, causes of action, demands or damages, known or unknown, fixed or contingent at law or in equity, and
waives and releases any and all rights and claims of any type that Employee may have had or now has at any time prior to the date
of full execution of this Agreement, against the Bank and/or the Employer Released Parties in any way related to Employee s
employment, or his termination of employment with the Bank other than for (i) the payment of the Severance Amount in accordance
with and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement; (ii) his COBRA rights; and (iii) his rights under any Qualified
Retirement Plan ( the Reserved Matters ). This waiver and release includes, but is not limited to: 

a.       any
claims for any tort, including wrongful termination, wrongful discharge, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress,
intentional interference with a contractual relationship or any other common law claims;  

b.       any claims for the breach of any
written, implied or oral contracts, including, but not limited to, any contract of employment;

claims of discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, race, religion, gender,
sex, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability or medical condition; 

d.       except for payments provided pursuant
to this Agreement, any claims for payments of any nature, including, but not limited to, wages, attorney s fees, costs, overtime
pay, vacation pay, severance pay, commissions, bonuses or the monetary equivalent of benefits; 

e.       except for the consideration provided
pursuant to this Agreement and any benefits under the Bank s Qualified Retirement Plan, any claims or rights under any benefit
plan, Vesting Agreement, or program of the Bank; and 

f.       any and all claims that may arise
under common law and all federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations and orders, including, but not limited

and Article 49B of the Maryland Annotated Code as each of them has been or may be amended, any state federal or local laws governing
whistleblowing or retaliation claims to the maximum extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the Sarbanes Oxley Act,
any laws or agreements that provide for punitive, exemplary or statutory damages, and any laws or agreements that provide for payment
of attorneys  fees, costs, or expenses, with the exclusion of any other benefits to which Employee is entitled, as a matter
of law, subsequent to his termination. 

8.            Waiver
of Claims  . Employee covenants that he has not and will not file suit in any court against the Bank, that he has not and
will not assist anyone else in filing suit in any court against the Bank, except as required by law, that he has not transferred
or assigned to any other person or entity any rights or claims against the Bank, and that he has not and will not file or assist
anyone else in filing any administrative complaint or charge with any federal, state or local agency against the Bank, except (a)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee, however, releases and waives any right to recover any monetary damages in any lawsuit
initiated individually by the Employee or as part of a collective action or by any governmental agency or other third party on
his behalf. 

Employee acknowledges and understands that
pursuant to the Federal Trade Secrets Act of 2016, he has been advised that he has immunity from being held criminally or civilly
liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a
Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose
of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit
or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 

9.            Entire
Agreement  . This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the parties hereto, and fully supersedes any prior agreements
or understandings between the parties. This Agreement is based upon the mutual understanding of the parties. Employee acknowledges
that he has not relied on any representations, promises, or agreements of any kind made to him in connection with his decision
to sign this Agreement, except for those set forth in this Agreement. Employee agrees that he shall continue to be bound by the
provisions contained in any agreement between him and the Bank that existed and was in effect at the time of Employee s termination.
In the event of a conflict between the provisions contained herein and the provisions contained in any such other agreement, the
more restrictive provisions shall control and govern. 

10.          Affirmations .
  Employee further affirms, represents and warrants that, with the exception of the payments he will receive pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, he has been paid and/or has received all compensation, wages, bonuses, commissions, and/or benefits to
which he may be entitled and that no other compensation, wages, bonuses, commissions and/or benefits are due to him, except for
the Reserved Matters. Employee furthermore affirms, represents and warrants that he has no known workplace injuries and he has
been provided and/or has not been denied any leave requested under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Employee further confirms
that he has never submitted any complaints that would fall under the False Claims Act or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and has never been discouraged or prevented from doing so. 

11.          Nondisparagement .    
 Employee agrees that he will not make or make, cause or encourage other persons or entities to make, any disparaging remarks
or comments about the Bank. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term  disparaging  means any statement made or
issued to the media, or other entities or persons, or in any judicial or quasi-judicial court proceeding that adversely reflects
on the Bank its employees, officers, directors or shareholders and/or its business interests and/or portrays the Bank its employees,
officers, directors or shareholders in a negative light. 

12.          Competence.   Employee
understands that the only consideration for his execution of this Agreement are the terms stated herein; that no other promise
or agreement of any kind has caused him to execute this Agreement; that he is competent to execute this Agreement; that the Agreement
has not been obtained by any duress, and that he fully understands the meaning and intent of this document. Employee further acknowledges
that he has signed this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily, and that he has not been threatened or coerced into signing this Agreement.
This Agreement shall be binding upon Employee s personal representatives, successors, assigns, heirs and devisees. 

13.           Nonadmission
of Wrongdoing  . Employee agrees that this Agreement shall not be deemed or construed at any time for any purpose as an admission
by the Bank of any liability or unlawful conduct of any kind. On behalf of Employee, this Agreement, in turn, shall not be deemed
or construed at any time for any purpose as an admission by Employee of any liability or unlawful conduct of any kind. 

14.          Governing
Law and Interpretation  . This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland
without regard to any provision that would result in the application of the laws of any other state or jurisdiction. In the event
that Employee breaches any provision of this Agreement, Employee and the Bank affirm that either may institute an action to specifically
enforce any term or terms of this Agreement. Should any provision of this Agreement be declared illegal or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be modified to be enforceable, excluding the release provisions in paragraph 7, such
provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full force and effect. 

15.          Amendment . 
This Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed except upon express written consent of both parties wherein specific reference
is made to this Agreement. 

16.          21-Day
Consideration Period . Employee represents, warrants and acknowledges that: 

a.       He has been advised that he has
the right to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement. 

b.       Employee s performance of
each and every provision, covenant and condition under this Agreement is a condition precedent to the Bank s obligation to
make any payment or confer any benefit hereunder. 

c.       Pursuant to the Federal Older
Workers  Benefit Protection Act, Employee has twenty-one (21) calendar days within which to consider whether or not to sign
this Agreement prior to its execution, and acknowledges that such time period has been offered by the Bank.
