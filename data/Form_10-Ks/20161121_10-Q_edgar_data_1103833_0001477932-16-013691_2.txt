CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS    (Unaudited)            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited consolidated financial statements.              Crown Equity Holdings, Inc.     CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS     (Unaudited)            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited consolidated financial statements.             CROWN EQUITY HOLDINGS, INC.     NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Crown Equity Holdings Inc. ( Crown Equity ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Crown Equity s December 31, 2015 Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end December 31, 2015 as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.      NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Crown Equity has an accumulated deficit of $10,720,136 and a working capital deficit of $156,424 as of June 30, 2016. Unless profitability and increase in shareholders  equity continues, these conditions raise substantial doubt as to Crown Equity's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Crown Equity is unable to continue as a going concern.     Crown Equity continues to review its expense structure reviewing costs and their reduction to move towards profitability. The Company s expenses are planned to decrease as a percent of revenue resulting in profitability and increased shareholders  equity.      NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      The Company is provided office space by one of the officers and directors at no charge. The Company believes that this office space is sufficient for its needs for the foreseeable future.     As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a payable of $5,026 to Montse Zaman, director.The payable is unsecured, bears no interest and due on demand.     As of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding notes payable to related parties of $23,674. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company issued a convertible note of $40,000 with conversion price at $0.50, and repaid $9,230 under other related party notes. The $40,000 convertible note has been converted to 80,000 shares of common stock according to the term of the note agreement at $0.5 per share. As of June 30, 2016 the aggregate outstanding balance under these related party notes payable was $14,444. These notes payables are with various officers and directors of the Company and with entities controlled by officers or directors of the Company including Mike Zaman, Montse Zaman and etc.           The Company evaluated embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging" and determine the embedded conversion feature(s) should not be bifurcated from the host instrument and not accounted for as a derivative. The Company further evaluated the instrument under ASC 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" and determine the conversion option is a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). The intrinsic value of the BCF is determined to be $36,000, and is recognized as debt discount against additional paid in capital. Since the note is converted during the six months ended June 30, 2016, the intrinsic value of the BCF is fully recognized as amortization of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2016.     During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company paid an aggregate of $5,830 of expenses on behalf of two related entities with common officers and directors. The Company holds investments in these entities.      NOTE 4   NOTES PAYABLE      As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate unpaid principal balance under notes payable was $9,500 and $11,500 respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company has a total additional borrowing of $17,000 convertible note from third parties. The notes payable are convertible into common stock at $0.50 per share. The $17,000 of convertible notes was fully converted into 34,000 shares of common stock during the period. $2,000 of non-convertible note and $707 of accrued interest were settled by issuing 5,000 shares of common stock at fair value of $22,150, resulted in a $19,443 loss on settlement of debt. As of June 30, 2016, the total outstanding short-term notes payable due to non-related third parties was $9,500. The notes were unsecured subject to annual interest ranging from 0% to 12%, due on demand.     The Company evaluated embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging" and determine the embedded conversion feature(s) should not be bifurcated from the host instrument and not accounted for as a derivative. The Company further evaluated the instrument under ASC 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" and determine the conversion option is a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). The intrinsic value of the BCF is determined to be $8,000, and is recognized as debt discount against additional paid in capital. Since the note is converted during the six month ended June 30, 2016, the intrinsic value of the BCF is fully recognized as amortization of debt discount during the six month ended June 30, 2016.      NOTE 5   EQUITY      During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued the following shares of common stock:            NOTE 6     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       Total common shares issued during July through November 2016 was 4,000 shares for cash proceeds of $4,000.

OVERVIEW     Crown Equity Holdings Inc. ( Crown Equity ) was incorporated in August 1995 in Nevada.

Our existing capital may not be sufficient to meet Crown Equity's cash needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This condition raises substantial doubt as to Crown Equity's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Crown Equity is unable to continue as a going concern.       ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 12b-2 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") and are not requires to provide information required under this Item.       ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the "Exchange Act"), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms because of the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weaknesses relate to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise. Our CEO and CFO also do not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee. This weakness is due to the company s lack of working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy this material weakness, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.       The Company was subject to the following judgment:     Lowell Holden vs. Kenneth Bosket, Crown Equity Holdings Inc.     On March 3, 2015, Lowell Holden received a judgment for $39,965 in the Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis, MN in reference to monies owed for prior services rendered. The judgment was settled with the plaintiff for $10,000. The Company accrued the $10,000 as settlement expense at June 30, 2015. The amount was paid in first quarter of 2016.       ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS  .       There have been no material changes to Crown Equity s risk factors as previously disclosed in our most recent 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2015.
