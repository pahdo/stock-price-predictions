      Table of Contents           C C Tours, Inc.    Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)     NOTE 1   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period ended September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented have been made.     Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial statements as reported in its Form 10-K. The results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ended December 31, 2016.     NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN     The Company's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has realized net losses since reactivation on June 1, 1991 totaling $187,349. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.     In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.     NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Basis of Presentation      The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company is currently in the development stage and has not realized significant sales through September 30, 2016. A development stage company is defined as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant.                 7       
      Table of Contents           C C Tours, Inc.   Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements  September 30, 2016   (Unaudited)     NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   continued      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     NOTE 4 - RECENT PRONOUNCEMENT     On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015; however, entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.      NOTE 5   LOANS PAYABLE     Loans payable consist of legal and accounting fees, and out-of-pocket costs incurred through a third party. These payables are non-collateralized, bear interest at 8%, and are due on demand. As such, these loans are classified as current on the Company s Balance Sheet. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $5,039 and $4,568, respectively. No payments on principal or interest have been made to date.     NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     The Company s management reviewed all material events through the date of this filing and has determined that there are no material subsequent events to report.                 8       
      Table of Contents           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      There are statements in this report that are not historical facts. These  forward-looking statements  can be identified by use of terminology such as  believe,   hope,   may,   anticipate,   should,   intend,   plan,   expect,   estimate,   project,   positioned,   strategy  and similar expressions. You should be aware that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. For a discussion of these risks, you should read this entire annual report carefully; especially the risks discussed under the section entitled  Risk Factors.       Although management believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included in this annual report are reasonable, they do not guarantee our future performance, and actual results could differ from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report will in fact transpire. You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

      Table of Contents            ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Executive Overview       We have not recorded revenues from operations to date. We have not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders or third parties to cover operating expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company.      The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur through a public offering.     Our management has not had any contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.     We anticipate that the Company will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.     We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       We have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and we have relied primarily upon other parties to provide loans and pay for operating expenses. At September 30, 2016 cash increased to $3,364 compared to $864 at December 31, 2015 primarily due to two loans totaling $9,000. Our total liabilities increased to $156,945 at September 30, 2016 compared to $137,606 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in liabilities primarily represents proceeds from loans, advances and services provided by third parties and accrued interest.      We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long term.      During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans provided by management, significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.               Results of Operations       We had no revenues during 2016 and 2015. General and administrative expense decreased to $11,800 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $12,950 for the 2015 nine month period. General and administrative expense decreased to $3,100 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $3,200 for the 2015 third quarter. The decrease in general and administrative expense in the 2016 interim periods primarily reflects reduced consulting services relied upon for our operations.     Total other expense increased to $5,039 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $4,568 for the 2015 nine month period. Total other expense increased to $1,755 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $1,602 for the 2015 third quarter. Total other expense represents interest expense on notes payable.     Our net loss decreased to $16,839 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $17,518 for the 2015 nine month period. Our net loss increased to $4,855 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $4,802 for the 2015 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.       Commitments and Obligations       At September 30, 2016 we recorded notes payable totaling $89,240 representing services received, as well as cash advances received from third parties. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand. Interest expense related to these notes payable totaled $5,039 for the 2016 nine month period and $4,568 for the 2015 nine month period. No payments on principal or interest have been made to date.     A third party consultant has provided professional services, paid for legal, accounting and administrative services on our behalf and/or provided advances to cover our operating costs. These contributions, totaling $43,440 at September 30, 2016, are not formally documented and we have recognized them as non-collateralized notes payable, that are payable on demand and carrying interest of 8%. No payments on principal or interest have been made to date.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.       Critical Accounting Policies       We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will not be required to:                    Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;                        Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency                         Obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and                        Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.                 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.      We will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed first fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.        ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company.        Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
