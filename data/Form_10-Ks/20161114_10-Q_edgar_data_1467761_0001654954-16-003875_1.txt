Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
( financial statements ) are unaudited. However, the
presentation of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
financial statements include all necessary adjustments to present
fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Zoom Telephonics, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Zoom ). The adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. 

The
results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2016
through the date of this filing and other than the subscription
agreements disclosed in Note 7, has determined that there are no
such events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial
statements. 

The
financial statements of the Company presented herein have been
prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not
include all of the information and disclosures required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the
year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company's 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-15,
"Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern." This
standard requires management to evaluate for each annual and
interim reporting period whether it is probable that the reporting
entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due
within one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued. If the entity is in such a position, the standard provides
for certain disclosures depending on whether or not the entity will
be able to successfully mitigate its going concern status. This
guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15,
2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company does
not expect a material impact to the Company s financial
condition, results from operations, or cash flows from the adoption
of this guidance. 

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  Currently,
all inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market. ASU
2015-11 changes the measurement principle for inventory from the
lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal and transportation. The standard is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
which for the Company commenced with the year beginning January 1,
2016. Prospective application is required. The Company does not
believe the implementation of this standard has a material impact
on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

In August 2015, the   FASB   issued   ASU No.
2015-14    Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the
Effective Date.  The amendments in this update defer the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain
employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period.   The Company is assessing the impact to the
Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
from the adoption of this guidance.  

5 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic
842).  ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the
assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee
should recognize in its balance sheet, a liability to make lease
payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease
term (the lease asset). For leases with a term of 12 months or
less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election
by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and
lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required
to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest
period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public
business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. Some of the simplified areas apply only to nonpublic
entities. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in
any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts ASU 2016-09
in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the
beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
Methods of adoption vary according to each of the amendment
provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 may have on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Revenue from
Contracts with Customers   Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing." ASU 2016-10 does not change the core
principle of the guidance, rather it clarifies the identification
of performance obligations and the licensing implementation
guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas.
ASU 2016-10 clarifies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is not yet
effective. The effective date and transition requirements for ASU
2016-10 are the same as for ASU 2014-09, which was deferred by one
year by ASU No.2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers
  Deferral of the Effective Date." Public business entities
should adopt the new revenue recognition standard for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted only
as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within that year. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of ASU
2016-10 may have on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts
with Customers   Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients." ASU 2016-12 does not change the core principle of the
guidance, rather it affects only certain narrow aspects of Topic
606, including assessing collectability, presentation of sales
taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract
modifications at transition. ASU 2016-12 affects the guidance in
ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)," which is not yet effective. The effective date and
transition requirements for ASU 2016-12 are the same as for ASU
2014-09, which was deferred by one year by ASU No. 2015-14,
"Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Deferral of the
Effective Date." Public business entities should adopt the new
revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that
year. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that year. The Company is currently evaluating the
potential impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-12 may have on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments
Credit Losses  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments." ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or group of
financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented
at the net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 is
effective for public business entities that are SEC filers for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in
any interim or annual period for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018. An entity should apply the amendments in ASU
2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the
guidance is effective (modified-retrospective approach). The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the
adoption of ASU 2016-13 may have on its consolidated financial
statements, however, it does not expect it to have a material
effect. 

(2) Liquidity  

The
Company s cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30,
2016 was approximately $175 thousand, a decrease of $1.7 million
from December 31, 2015. Major uses of cash were attributed to a
$1.9 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an
increase of approximately $1.8 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of approximately $1.4 million in inventory, and an
increase of approximately $0.2 million in prepaid expense. These
were partially offset by increases of approximately $2.1 million in
bank debt, approximately $0.7 million in accrued expenses, and
approximately $0.4 million in accounts payable. 

6 

On
September 30, 2016 the Company had approximately $2.1 million in
bank debt of a $3.0 million credit line, working capital of
approximately $2.9 million including approximately $175 thousand in
cash and cash equivalents. The Company raised $3.65 million from a
$3.42 million private placement in September 2015 and a $229
thousand rights offering in July 2015. On December 31, 2015 the
Company had working capital of approximately $4.4 million including
approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. The
Company s current ratio at September 30, 2016 was 1.6
compared to 3.6 at December 31, 2015. 

On May 18, 2015, the Company announced
licensing of the Motorola trademark for cable modems and gateways
for the U.S. and Canada for five years starting January 2016 
In order to support anticipated sales growth, the Company raised
approximately $3.65 million as described above. The Company
believes that its existing financial resources, supplemented by net
proceeds of approximately $1.5 million from the private placement
offering that occurred subsequent to September 30, 2016, along with
its existing line of credit and recent increase to the credit
limit, will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next
twelve months. 

(3)
Inventories 

Finished
goods includes consigned inventory held by our customers of
$402,963 at September 30, 2016 and $119,100 at December 31, 2015.
The Company reviews inventory for obsolete and slow moving products
each quarter and makes provisions based on its estimate of the
probability that the material will not be consumed or that it will
be sold below cost. The provision for inventory reserves was
negligible in both the first nine months of 2016 and
2015. 

(4)
Commitments and Contingencies 

From
time to time, the Company is party to various lawsuits and
administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company evaluates such lawsuits and proceedings on a
case-by-case basis, and its policy is to vigorously contest any
such claims, that it believes are without merit. The Company's
management believes that the ultimate resolution of such matters
will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business,
financial position, or results of operations. 

On
January 30, 2015, Wetro LAN LLC ("Wetro LAN") filed a complaint in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
(U.S.D.C., E.D.Tex.) against the Company alleging infringement of
U.S. Patent No. 6,795,918 ( the  918 patent )
entitled  Service Level Computer Security.  Wetro LAN
alleged that the Company s wireless routers, including its
Model 4501 Wireless-N Router, infringe the '918 patent.  In
its complaint, Wetro LAN sought unspecified compensatory
damages.  The case was resolved on May 18, 2016 with the
entry by the Judge of an Order of Dismissal with
Prejudice. 

On
May 17, 2016, Magnacross LLC ("Magnacross") filed a complaint in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
(U.S.D.C., E.D.Tex.) against the Company alleging infringement of
U.S. Patent No. 6,917,304 ( the  304 patent )
entitled  Wireless Multiplex Data Transmission System. 
Magnacross alleged that the Company s wireless routers,
including its Model 5363, 5360 5354 (N300, N600, AC1900) Routers,
infringe the '304 patent. In its complaint, Magnacross sought
injunctive relief and unspecified compensatory damages. The case is
in its early stages and the Court entered an Amended Docket Control
Order on October 12, 2016.   If the case is not otherwise
resolved, trial is scheduled to commence on November 6,
2017.

On
May 14, 2015, Zoom entered into a License Agreement with Motorola
Mobility LLC (the  License Agreement ).  The
License Agreement provides Zoom with an exclusive license to use
certain trademarks owned by Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC. for
the manufacture, sale and marketing of consumer cable modem
products in the United States and Canada through certain authorized
sales channels. 

On
August 8, 2016, Zoom entered into an amendment to the License
Agreement with Motorola Mobility LLC (the
 Amendment ).  The Amendment expands
Zoom s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a
wide range of authorized channels worldwide, and expands the
license from cable modems and gateways to also include consumer
routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters, and
access points. The License Agreement, as amended, has a five-year
term beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2020. 

In
connection with the amended License Agreement, the Company has
committed to spend a certain percentage of its Motorola revenues
for use in advertising, merchandising and promotion of the related
products. Additionally, the Company is required to make quarterly
royalty payments equal to a certain percentage of the preceding
quarter s net sales with minimum annual royalty payments as
follows: 

Year ending December 31, 

2016:
                                                   
$2,000,000 

2017:
                                                   
$3,000,000 

2018:
                                                   
$3,500,000 

2019:                                                    
$4,000,000 

2020:
                                                   
$4,500,000 

Royalty
expense under the License Agreement amounted to $583,333 for the
third quarter of 2016 and $1,416,666 for the first nine months of
2016, and is included in selling expense on the accompanying
condensed consolidated statements of operations. The balance of the
committed royalty expense for 2016 amounts to $583,334 for the
remaining quarter of 2016. 

In
order to facilitate the Company s current and planned
increase in production demand, driven in part by the launch of
Motorola branded products, the Company has committed with North
American Production Sharing, Inc. ( NAPS ) to extend
its existing lease used in connection with the Production Sharing
Agreement ( PSA ) entered into between the Company and
NAPS. The extension term is December 1, 2015 through November 30,
2018 and allows the Company to contract additional Mexican
personnel to work in the Tijuana facility. 

The
Company moved its headquarters on June 29, 2016 from its long time
location at 207 South Street, Boston, MA. to a nearby location at
99 High Street, Boston, MA. The Company signed a lease for 11,480
square feet that terminates on June 29, 2019. Payments under the
lease are zero for the first 2 months, an aggregate of $413,280 for
the next 12 months, an aggregate of $424,760 for the next 12
months, and an aggregate of $363,533 for the remaining term of the
lease ending June 29, 2019. Rent expense amounted to $99,876 for
the third quarter of 2016 and $302,935 for the first nine months of
2016. 

(5)
Customer Concentrations  

The
Company sells its products primarily through high-volume retailers
and distributors, Internet service providers, value-added
resellers, personal computer system integrators, and original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). The Company supports its major
accounts in their efforts to offer a well-chosen selection of
attractive products and to maintain appropriate inventory
levels. 

Relatively
few customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the
Company s revenues.  In the third quarter of 2016, three
customers accounted for 86% of the Company s net sales with
the Company s largest customer accounting for 32% of its net
sales. In the first nine months of 2016, three customers accounted
for 81% of the Company s total net sales with the
Company s largest customer accounting for 30% of its net
sales. At September 30, 2016 three customers accounted for 88% of
the Company s accounts receivable, with the Company s
largest customer representing 48% of its accounts receivable. In
the third quarter of 2015, three customers accounted for 79% of the
Company s total net sales with the Company s largest
customer accounting for 48% of its net sales. In the first nine
months of 2015, three customers accounted for 77% of the
Company s total net sales with the Company s largest
customer accounting for 46% of its net sales. At September 30,
2015, three customers accounted for 90% of the Company s
accounts receivable, with the Company s largest customer
representing 61% of its accounts receivable. 

8 

The
Company s customers generally do not enter into long-term
agreements obligating them to purchase products. The Company may
not continue to receive significant revenues from any of these or
from other large customers. A reduction or delay in orders from any
of the Company s significant customers, or a delay or default
in payment by any significant customer, could materially harm the
Company s business and prospects. Because of the
Company s significant customer concentration, its net sales
and operating income (loss) could fluctuate significantly due to
changes in political or economic conditions, or the loss, reduction
of business, or less favorable terms for any of the Company's
significant customers. 

(6) Bank Credit
Lines  

On December 18, 2012, the Company entered into a
Financing Agreement with Rosenthal   Rosenthal, Inc. (the
 Financing Agreement ). The Financing Agreement
originally provided for up to $1.75 million of revolving credit,
subject to a borrowing base formula and other terms and conditions.
The Financing Agreement continued until November 30, 2014 with
automatic renewals from year to year thereafter, unless sooner
terminated by either party. The lender has the right to terminate
the Financing Agreement at any time on 60 days  prior written
notice.     Borrowings
are secured by all of the Company assets including intellectual
property. The Financing Agreement contains several covenants,
including a requirement that the Company maintain tangible net
worth of not less than $2.5 million and working capital of not less
than $2.5 million.  

On
March 25, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to the
Financing Agreement (the  Amendment ) with an effective
date of January 1, 2013. The Amendment clarified the definition of
current assets in the Financing Agreement, reduced the size of the
revolving credit line to $1.25 million, and revised the financial
covenants so that Zoom is required to maintain tangible net worth
of not less than $2.0 million and working capital of not less than
$1.75 million. 

On
October 29, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to
the Financing Agreement (the  Second Amendment ).
Retroactive to October 1, 2015, the Second Amendment eliminated
$2,500 in monthly charges for the Financing Agreement. Effective
December 1, 2015, the Second Amendment reduces the effective rate
of interest to 2.25% plus an amount equal to the higher of prime
rate or 3.25%. 

On
July 19, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to the
Financing Agreement. The Amendment increased the size of the
revolving credit line to $2.5 million effective as of date of the
amendment. 

On
September 1, 2016, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to
the Financing Agreement. The Amendment increased the size of the
revolving credit line to $3.0 million effective with the date of
this amendment. 

The
Company is required to calculate its covenant compliance on a
quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in
compliance with both its working capital and tangible net worth
covenants. At September 30, 2016, the Company s tangible net
worth was approximately $3.1 million, while the Company s
working capital was approximately $2.9 million. 

(7) Subsequent Events 

On
October 24, 2016, Zoom entered into stock subscription agreements
with investors in connection with a non-brokered private placement
of 619,231 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock,
which raised approximately $1.5 million net proceeds. 

Management
of the Company has reviewed subsequent events from September 30,
2016 through the date of filing and has concluded that, except as
noted above, there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment
to or disclosure in these consolidated financial
statements.

Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016 and in our
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers
should also be cautioned that results of any reported period are
often not indicative of results for any future period. 

Overview  

We
derive our net sales primarily from sales of Internet access and
other communications-related products, including cable modems,
cable modem / routers, Digital Subscriber Line ( DSL )
modems and dial-up modems to retailers, distributors, Internet
Service Providers and original equipment manufacturers
( OEMs ). We sell our products through a direct sales
force and through independent sales agents. All but one of our
employees are located at our headquarters in Boston,
Massachusetts.  We are experienced in electronics
hardware, firmware, and software design and test, regulatory
certifications, product documentation, and packaging; and we use
that experience in developing each product in-house or in
partnership with suppliers who are typically based in Asia.
Electronic assembly and testing of our products in accordance with
our specifications is typically done in Asia. 

Since
1983 our headquarters have been near South Station in downtown
Boston. We recently moved from our long time location at 207 South
Street to 99 High Street in Boston. The lease for this new location
terminates June 29, 2019. We also lease a test/warehouse/ship
facility in Tijuana, Mexico. In November 2014 we signed a one-year
lease with five one-year renewal options thereafter for an 11,390
square foot facility in Tijuana Mexico. In September 2015, Zoom
extended the term of the lease from December 1, 2015 through
November 30, 2018. In September 2015, Zoom also signed a new lease
for additional space in the adjacent building, which doubled the
existing capacity. The term of the lease is from March 1, 2016
through November 30, 2018 with early access granted as of December
1, 2015. 

We
continually seek to improve our product designs and manufacturing
approach in order to improve product performance and reduce our
costs. We pursue a strategy of outsourcing rather than internally
developing our modem chipsets, which are application-specific
integrated circuits that form the technology base for our modems.
By outsourcing the chipset technology, we are able to concentrate
our research and development resources on modem system design,
leverage the extensive research and development capabilities of our
chipset suppliers, and reduce our development time and associated
costs and risks. As a result of this approach, we are able to
quickly develop new products while maintaining a relatively low
level of research and development expense as a percentage of
net sales. We also outsource aspects of our manufacturing to
contract manufacturers as a means of reducing our costs of
production, and to provide us with greater flexibility in our
production capacity. 

10 

Our
gross margin for a given product generally depends on a number of
factors including the type of customer to whom we are selling. The
gross margin for retailers tends to be higher than for some of our
other customers; conversely, the sales, support, returns, and
overhead costs associated with retailers tend to be higher. Our
sales to certain countries are currently handled by a single master
distributor for each country, who handles the support and marketing
costs within the country. Gross margin for sales to these master
distributors tends to be low, since lower pricing to these
distributors helps them to cover the support and marketing costs
for their country. 

As
of September 30, 2016 we had 30 employees, 25 working full-time and
5 working less than five days per week. Ten employees were engaged
in research and development and quality control. Five employees
were involved in operations, which manages production, inventory,
purchasing, warehousing, freight, invoicing, shipping, collections,
and returns. Nine employees were engaged in sales, marketing, and
consumer support. The remaining six employees performed executive,
accounting, administrative, and management information systems
functions. Our dedicated personnel in Tijuana, Mexico are employees
of our Mexican service provider and are not included in our
headcount. As of September 30, 2016, we had one consultant in sales
and one consultant in information systems, neither of whom is
included in our headcount.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Following
is a discussion of what we view as our more significant accounting
policies and estimates. As described below, management judgments
and estimates must be made and used in connection with the
preparation of our financial statements. We have identified areas
where material differences could result in the amount and timing of
our net sales, costs, and expenses for any period if we had made
different judgments or used different estimates. 

Revenue Recognition. 
 We primarily sell hardware products to
our customers. The hardware products include dial-up modems, DSL
modems, cable modems, and local area networking
equipment.  

We
derive our net sales primarily from the sales of hardware products
to four types of customers: 

Computer
peripherals retailers, 

Computer
product distributors, 

Internet
service providers, and 

OEMs. 

We
recognize hardware net sales for our customers at the point when
the customers take legal ownership of the delivered products. Legal
ownership passes from Zoom to the customer based on the contractual
Free on Board ( FOB ) point specified in signed
contracts and purchase orders, which are both used extensively.
Many of our customer contracts or purchase orders specify FOB
destination, which means that title and risk remain with the seller
until it has delivered the goods to the location specified in the
contract. We verify the delivery date on all significant FOB
destination shipments made during the last 10 business days of each
quarter. 

Our
net sales of hardware include reductions resulting from certain
events which are characteristic of the sales of hardware to
retailers of computer peripherals. These events are product
returns, certain sales and marketing incentives, price protection
refunds, and consumer mail-in and in-store rebates. Each of these
is accounted for as a reduction of net sales based on detailed
management estimates, which are reconciled to actual customer or
end-consumer credits on a monthly or quarterly basis. 

Product
Returns  . Products are returned
by retail stores and distributors for inventory balancing,
contractual stock rotation privileges, and warranty repair or
replacements. We estimate the sales and cost value of expected
future product returns of previously sold products. Our estimates
for product returns are based on recent historical trends plus
estimates for returns prompted by, among other things, announced
stock rotations and announced customer store closings. Management
reviews historical returns, current economic trends, and changes in
customer demand and acceptance of our products when estimating
sales return allowances. The estimate for future returns is
recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable, a reduction in
our net sales, and the corresponding change to inventory reserves
and cost of sales.  

11 

Price Protection
Refunds.   We have a policy of
offering price protection to certain of our retailer and
distributor customers for some or all their inventory. Under the
price protection policies, when we reduce our prices for a product,
the customer receives a credit for the difference between the
original purchase price and our reduced price for their unsold
inventory of that product. Our estimates for price protection
refunds are based on a detailed understanding and tracking by
customer and by sales program. Estimated price protection refunds
are recorded in the same period as the announcement of a pricing
change. Information from customer inventory-on-hand reports or from
direct communications with the customers is used to estimate the
refund, which is recorded as a reduction of net sales and a reserve
against accounts receivable.  

Sales and Marketing
Incentives  . Many of our
retailer customers require sales and marketing support funding,
usually set as a percentage of our sales in their stores. The
incentives were reported as reductions in our net
sales.  

Consumer Mail-In and In-Store
Rebates  . Our estimates for
consumer mail-in and in-store rebates are based on a detailed
understanding and tracking by customer and sales program, supported
by actual rebate claims processed by the rebate redemption centers
plus an accrual for an estimated lag in processing at the
redemption centers. The estimate for mail-in and in-store rebates
is recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable and a
reduction of net sales in the same period that the rebate
obligation was triggered.  

Accounts Receivable
Valuation  . We establish
accounts receivable valuation allowances equal to the
above-discussed net sales adjustments for estimates of product
returns, price protection refunds, consumer rebates, and general
bad debt reserves. These allowances are reduced as actual credits
are issued to the customer's accounts.  

Inventory Valuation and Cost of
Goods Sold.   Inventory is valued
at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method,
or its net realizable value. We review inventories for obsolete
slow moving products each quarter and make provisions based on our
estimate of the probability that the material will not be consumed
or that it will be sold below cost. Additionally, material product
certification costs on new products are capitalized and amortized
over the expected period of value of the respective
products.  

Valuation and Impairment of
Deferred Tax Assets.   As part of
the process of preparing our financial statements we estimate our
income tax expense and deferred income tax position. This process
involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together
with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which
are included in our balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood
that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we
establish a valuation allowance. Changes in the valuation allowance
are reflected in the statement of operations.  

Significant
management judgment is required in determining our provision for
income taxes and any valuation allowances. We have recorded a 100%
valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. It is
management's estimate that, after considering all available
objective evidence, historical and prospective, with greater weight
given to historical evidence, it is more likely than not that these
assets will not be realized. If we establish a record of continuing
profitability, at some point we will be required to reduce the
valuation allowance and recognize an equal income tax benefit which
will increase net income in that period(s). 

As
of December 31, 2015 the Company had federal net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $50.7 million that are available to
offset future taxable income. They are due to expire in
varying amounts from 2018 to 2035. As of December 31, 2015,
the Company had Massachusetts state net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $5.1 million that are available to offset
future taxable income. They are due to expire in varying amounts
from 2031 through 2035.

ended September 30, 2015 

Summary . Net sales were $5.99 million
for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 ( Q3
2016 ), up 77.9%% from $3.37 million for Q3 2015. Zoom
reported a net loss of $244 thousand for Q3 2016 compared to a net
loss of $8 thousand for Q3 2015. 

Net Sales . Our total net sales for Q3
2016 increased $2.62 million or 77.9% from Q3 2015, primarily due
to continued expansion of Motorola branded products. 

Concentration.  In Q3 2016, three
customers accounted for 86% of the Company s net sales with
the Company s largest customer accounting for 32% of its net
sales. In Q3 2015, three customers accounted for 79% of the

sales in Q3 2016, down slightly from $354 thousand or 10.5% of net
sales in Q3 2015.  Increased
engineering personnel costs were offset by decreases in outside
engineering expenses.  

Other Income (Expense).  Other income was
$14 thousand in Q3 2016, driven by a one-time favorable settlement
on a class action lawsuit for approximately $41 thousand, reduced
by loan interest costs of approximately $27 thousand. Other expense
was $27 thousand in Q3 2015 due to interest expense related to our
bank credit line.

total net sales with the Company s largest customer
accounting for 30% of its net sales. In the first nine months of
2015, three customers accounted for 77% of the Company s
total net sales with the Company s largest customer
accounting for 46% of its net sales. 

Gross Profit.  Gross profit was $3.96
million for the first nine months of 2016, up $1.05 million or
36.1% from gross profit of $2.91 million for the first nine months
of 2015.   Improvement in
gross profit was primarily due to increased sales. 

Selling Expense.  Selling expense was
$3.52 million or 27.7% of net sales in the first nine months of
2016, up from $1.21 million or 13.4% of net sales in the first nine
months of 2015. The increase of $2.31 million was primarily due to
Motorola brand royalty payments, and increased marketing and
advertising costs. 

General and Administrative
Expense.   General and
administrative expense was $1.24 million or 9.7% of net sales for
the first nine months of 2016, up 52.5% from $0.81 million or 9.0%
of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. The increase of
$426 thousand was primarily due to increased personnel costs, stock
option expenses, audit and legal costs, and increased investor
relations services.  

13 

Research and Development Expense. 
Research and development expense was $1.15 million or 9.1% of net
sales in the first nine months of 2016, up 25.8% from $0.92 million
or 10.2% of net sales in the first nine months of 2015. The
increase of $237 thousand was due primarily to increased personnel
and related costs, and increased product certification and testing
expenses. 

Other Income (Expense).  Other income was
$10 thousand in the first nine months of 2016, driven by a one-time
favorable settlement on a class action lawsuit for approximately
$41 thousand, reduced by loan interest costs of approximately $32
thousand. Other expense was $73 thousand in the first nine months
quarter of 2015 due to interest expense on our bank credit
line. 

Net Income (Loss).  The net loss was
$1.94 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the
net loss of $109 thousand for the first nine months of
2015. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s cash and cash equivalents balance on September 30,
2016 was approximately $175 thousand, a decrease of $1.7 million
from December 31, 2015. Major uses of cash were attributed to a
$1.9 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an
increase of approximately $1.8 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of approximately $1.4 million in inventory, and an
increase of approximately $0.2 million in prepaid expense. These
were partially offset by increases of approximately $2.1 million in
bank debt, approximately $0.7 million in accrued expenses, and
approximately $0.4 million in accounts payable. 

On
September 30, 2016 the Company had approximately $2.1 million in
bank debt of a $3.0 million credit line and working capital of
approximately $2.9 million including approximately $175 thousand in
cash and cash equivalents. The Company raised $3.65 million from a
$3.42 million private placement in September 2015 and a $229
thousand rights offering in July 2015. On December 31, 2015 the
Company had working capital of approximately $4.4 million including
approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. The
Company s current ratio at September 30, 2016 was 1.6
compared to 3.6 at December 31, 2015. 

On May 18, 2015, the
Company announced licensing of the Motorola trademark for cable
modems and gateways for the U.S. and Canada for five years starting
January 2016.   In order to
support anticipated sales growth, the Company raised approximately
$3.65 million as described above. The Company believes that its
existing financial resources supplemented by the net proceeds of
approximately $1.5 million raised in the recent private placement
offering, along with its existing line of credit and recent
increase to the credit limit, will be sufficient to fund operations
for at least the next twelve months.

of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Acting Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on the
Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management including our Chief
Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2016. Based

b)   Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
