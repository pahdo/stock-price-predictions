Note 1 - Nature of Business 
    
  Anchor Bancorp (the  Company ), a Washington corporation, was formed in connection with the conversion of Anchor Mutual Savings Bank (the  Bank ) from the mutual to the stock form of organization. On January 25, 2011, the Bank completed its conversion from mutual to stock form, changed its name to  Anchor Bank  and became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
    
  Anchor Bank is a community-based savings bank primarily serving Western Washington through its   10   full-service bank offices (including   one   Wal-Mart in-store location) within Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, Pierce, and Mason counties, and   one   loan production office located in King County, Washington.  Anchor Bank s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans. 

Note 2 - Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. It is recommended that these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 ( 2015 Form 10-K ).  The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current fiscal year presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on previously reported consolidated net income or equity.  The Company has evaluated events and transactions subsequent to September 30, 2016 for potential recognition or disclosure. 

Note 3 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   The ASU is part of the FASB simplification initiative aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. Importantly, the guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction - that is, companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets.   The new standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured as fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 is being reviewed for any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842  ). The amendments in this ASU require lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term) at the commencement date; a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leave lessor accounting largely unchanged, although certain targeted improvements were made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This ASU simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance

sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to determine any material impact the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  : Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).  The amendments in this ASU require entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-08 to determine any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amends   ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation  . The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is being reviewed for any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  : Identifying Performance Obligations. The amendments in this ASU   provide more detailed guidance on the revenue recognition standard including additional implementation guidance and examples of identifying performance obligations and licenses of intellectual property.   The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within that year. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-10 to determine any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  : Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this ASU clarified several key areas of the revenue recognition standard including accessing collectability, presenting sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modification at transitions, completed contracts at transition, and disclosing the accounting change in the period of adoption.     The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within that year. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-12 to determine any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The standard will take effect for SEC filers for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 is being reviewed for any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force  . The ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will take effect for SEC filers for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 is being reviewed for any material impact there may be on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 - Earnings Per Share ("EPS") 
    
  Basic earnings per common share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and is equal to net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, without considering any dilutive items. Unvested share-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method described in ASC 260-10-45-60B. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares that may be issued upon the vesting of restricted stock awards. Therefore, under the two-class method, the difference in EPS is not significant since the Company did not pay dividends for these participating securities. The following table details the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

Shares owned by the Company's ESOP that have not been allocated are not considered be outstanding for the purpose of computing basic and diluted EPS.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 there were   60,532   and   62,252   shares, respectively, which had not been allocated under the Company's ESOP. 
    
  Potential dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were   no   incremental shares that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because those shares under the treasury stock method of calculation would have resulted in them being anti-dilutive.

Note 5 - Investments 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair market values of investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , were as follows: 

(1)      Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") 
   (2)      Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") 
   (3)      Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae")          

There were   27   and   24   securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The unrealized losses on investments in mortgage-backed securities relate principally to the general change in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, that has occurred since the securities' purchase dates, and such unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate level fluctuations in the future.  We do not intend to sell the temporarily impaired securities and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the securities prior to their maturity.  We do expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities. The fair value of temporarily impaired securities, the amount of unrealized losses, and the length of time these unrealized losses existed as of the dates indicated, were as follows:

Contractual maturities of securities at   September 30, 2016   are listed below.

Allowance for Loan Losses.    The allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The assessment includes analysis of several different factors, including delinquency, charge-off rates and the changing risk profile of our loan portfolio, as well as local economic conditions such as unemployment rates, bankruptcies and vacancy rates of business and residential properties.

(1)             Consumer loans include home equity, credit cards, automobile, and other consumer loans. The only consumer loans with impairment are home equity loans. 
    
  A loan is considered impaired when the Company has determined that it may be unable to collect payments of principal or interest when due under the terms of the loan. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors which include payment history and status, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case by case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the smaller groups of homogeneous consumer loans in the portfolio.

  Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans  . Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment of obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions.

  Credit Quality Indicators.   We utilize a ten-point risk rating system and assign a risk rating for all credit exposures. The risk rating system is designed to define the basic characteristics and identify risk elements of each credit extension. 
    
  Credits risk rated 1 through 7 are considered to be  pass  credits. Pass credits can be assets where there is virtually no credit risk, such as cash secured loans with funds on deposit with the Bank. Pass credits also include credits that are on our watch and special mention lists, where the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses, which may, if not checked or corrected, negatively affect the borrower's financial capacity and threaten their ability to fulfill debt obligations in the future.  A seasoned loan with a Debt Service Coverage Ratio ("DSCR") of greater than   1.00   is the minimum acceptable level for a "Pass Credit".  Particular attention is paid to the coverage trend analysis as any loan with a declining DSCR trend may warrant a higher risk grade even if the current coverage is at or above the   1.00   threshold.

Credits classified as Watch are risk rated 6 and possess weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. These assets do not expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification in the substandard, doubtful or loss categories. We use this rating when a material documentation deficiency exists but correction is anticipated within an acceptable time frame.  
    
  A loan classified as Watch may have the following characteristics: 

Acceptable asset quality, but requiring increased monitoring. Strained liquidity and less than anticipated performance. The loan may be fully leveraged.  
                
    Apparent management weakness, perhaps demonstrated by an irregular flow of adequate and/or timely performance information required to support the credit.  
                
    The borrower has a plausible plan to correct problem(s) in the near future that is devoid of material uncertainties.  
                
    Lacks reserve capacity, so the risk rating will improve or decline in relatively short time (results of corrective actions should be apparent within six months or less).  
       
  Credits classified as Special Mention are risk rated 7. These credits have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset.   Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  
    
  A loan classified as Special Mention may have the following characteristics: 

Performance is poor or significantly less than expected. A debt service deficiency either exists or cannot be ruled out.  
                
    Generally an undesirable business credit. Assets in this category are protected, but are potentially weak. These assets constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a classification of Substandard.   Special Mention assets have potential weaknesses which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Bank's credit position at some future date.  
                
    Assets which might be detailed in this category include credits that the lending officer may be unable to supervise properly because of lack of expertise, an inadequate loan agreement, the condition of and control over collateral, failure to obtain proper documentation, or any other deviations from prudent lending practices.  
                
    An adverse trend in the borrower's operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet which does not jeopardize liquidation may best be handled by this classification.  
                
    A Special Mention classification should not be used as a compromise between a pass and substandard rating. Assets in which actual, not potential, weaknesses are evident and significant, and should be considered for more serious criticism.  
       
  A loan classified as Substandard is risk rated 8. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged.  
    
  A loan classified as Substandard may have the following characteristics: 

Unacceptable business credit. The asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  
                
    Though no loss is envisioned, the outlook is sufficiently uncertain to preclude ruling out the possibility. Some liquidation of assets will likely be necessary as a corrective measure.  
                
    Assets in this category may demonstrate performance problems such as debt servicing deficiencies with no immediate relief, including having a DSCR of less than   1.00  . Borrowers have an inability to adjust to prolonged and unfavorable industry or economic trends. Management's character and/or effectiveness have become suspect.  
     A loan classified as Doubtful is risk rated 9 and has all the inherent weaknesses as those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable is improbable. 
  A loan classified as Doubtful is risk rated 9 and has the following characteristics: 
             
    The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined.

Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans. 
     A loan risk rated 10 is a loan for which a total loss is expected. 
  A loan classified as a Loss has the following characteristics: 
             
    An uncollectible asset or one of such little value that it does not warrant classification as an active, earning asset. Such an asset may, however, have recovery or salvageable value, but not to the point of deferring full write off, even though some recovery may occur in the future.  
                
    The Bank will charge off such assets as a loss during the accounting period in which they were identified.  
                
    Loan to be eliminated from the active loan reporting system via charge off.

Troubled Debt Restructures  . A troubled debt restructure ("TDR") is a loan where the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial condition, has granted a concession to the borrower that it would otherwise not consider so that the borrower can continue to make payments while minimizing the Company's potential loss. The modifications have included items such as lowering the interest rate on the loan for a period of time and extending the maturity date of the loan. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and is in the Bank's best interest.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a TDR.

Note 8 - Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  On January 25, 2011, the Company established an ESOP for the benefit of substantially all employees. The ESOP borrowed   $1.0 million   from the Company and used those funds to acquire   102,000   shares of the Company's common stock at the time of the initial public offering at a price of   $10.00   per share. 
    
  Shares purchased by the ESOP with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account and allocated to ESOP participants on a pro rata basis as principal and interest payments are made by the ESOP to the Company. The loan is secured by shares purchased with the loan proceeds and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from the Company's discretionary contributions to the ESOP and earnings on the ESOP assets. Payments of principal and interest are due annually on June 30th, the Company's fiscal year end. 
    
  As shares are committed to be released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the daily average market prices of the shares and the shares become outstanding for EPS computations. The compensation expense is accrued throughout the year. 
    
  Compensation expense related to the ESOP for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $44,000   and   $38,000  , respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance   -The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
  Securities   - The estimated fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices of similar securities. 
  FHLB stock   - FHLB stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted to the member institutions, and can only be purchased and redeemed at par.   
  Loans held for sale   - The fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on quoted market prices from FHLMC.  FHLMC quotes are updated daily and represent prices at which loans are exchanged in high volumes and in a liquid market. 
  Loans receivable   - For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of fixed-rate loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  As a result of current market conditions, cash flow estimates have been further discounted to include a credit factor.  The fair value of nonperforming loans is estimated using the fair value of the underlying collateral. 
  Demand deposits, savings, money market, and certificates of deposit   - The fair value of the Bank's demand deposits, savings, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
  FHLB advances   - The fair value of the Bank's FHLB advances was calculated using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate was equal to the current rate offered by the FHLB for advances of similar remaining maturities.

  Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  On October 21, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the Anchor Bancorp 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("Plan"), which provides for awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock options to directors, advisory directors, directors emeriti, officers and employees. The cost of awards under the Plan generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the Plan is   193,800  .  Shares of common stock issued under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or repurchased shares. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, awards for restricted stock totaling   87,572   were outstanding and no stock options were granted.  Awarded shares of restricted stock typically vest over various periods as long as the director, advisory director, directors emeriti, officer or employee remains in service to the Company.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based on the fair value of the shares at the award date. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 total compensation expense for the Plan was   $224,000  , and the related income tax benefit was   $76,000  . 
    
  The following table provides a summary of changes in non-vested restricted stock awards for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $  566,000   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested shares granted as restricted stock awards.  The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately   two   years. 

Note 11 - Federal Income Taxes 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition included a net deferred tax asset of   $8.7 million  .  The Company's primary deferred tax assets relate to the allowance for loan losses.  The Company has prepared federal tax returns through June 30, 2015.  At June 30, 2016 the net operating loss carryforward was   $12.7 million   which will begin to expire in 2031.

Under GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is  more likely than not  that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our policy is to evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset if we do not have sufficient positive evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. Each quarter, we consider positive evidence, which may include taxes paid in carryback years, reversing timing differences, available tax planning strategies, and projected taxable income and weigh it against negative evidence, which may include cumulative losses in the most recent three year period and uncertainty regarding short-term future earnings, among other items.  At September 30, 2016, management determined that no valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset was required. This determination was based on sufficient positive evidence associated with our return to profitability, demonstrated through cumulative earnings over the recent three year period, strong quarterly income, and our projections for future taxable income.

Background and Overview 
    
  Anchor Bancorp is a bank holding company which primarily engages in the business activity of its subsidiary, Anchor Bank.  Anchor Bank is a community-based savings bank primarily serving Western Washington through our   10   full-service banking offices (including   one   Wal-Mart in-store location) within Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, Pierce, and Mason counties, and loan production office located in King County, Washington. We are in the business of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans. We offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers. Historically, our principal lending activity has consisted of the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one-to-four family residences and loans for the construction of one-to-four family residences, as well as consumer loans, with an emphasis on home equity loans and lines of credit. Recently, we have been aggressively offering commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans primarily in Western Washington.  
    
  Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates also affect our net interest income. Additionally, to offset the impact of the current low interest rate environment, we are seeking other means of increasing interest income while controlling expenses. We intend to enhance the mix of our assets by further increasing our commercial business relationships which have higher risk-adjusted returns.  These commercial business relationships also typically help us generate lower cost deposits.  A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes gains on sales of assets, and revenue we receive from providing products and services. In recent years, our noninterest expense has exceeded our net interest income after provision for loan losses and we have relied primarily on fee income to supplement our net interest income. 
    
  Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits, general and administrative, real estate owned expenses, FDIC insurance premiums, information technology, occupancy and equipment, deposit services and marketing expenses. Compensation and benefits expense consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Accounting Policies 
    
  We use estimates and assumptions in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. These policies relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses, deferred income taxes and the associated income tax expense, as well as valuation of real estate owned. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses for adequacy on a monthly basis and establishes a provision for loan losses that it believes is sufficient for the loan portfolio growth expected and the loan quality of the existing portfolio. The carrying value of real estate owned is assessed on a quarterly basis. Income tax expense and deferred income taxes are calculated using an estimated tax rate and are based on management's understanding of our effective tax rate and the tax code. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses.   Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our Board of Directors and management assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis.  The Executive Loan Committee analyzes several different factors including delinquency rates, charge-off rates and the changing risk 
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

profile of our loan portfolio, as well as local economic conditions such as unemployment rates, the bankruptcies and vacancy rates of business and residential properties.  
    
  We believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about future losses on loans. The impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings.  
    
  Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of specific allocations on significant individual credits that meet the definition of impaired and a general allowance amount. The specific allowance component is determined when management believes that the collectability of a specifically identified large loan has been impaired and a loss is probable. The general allowance component relates to assets with no well-defined deficiency or weakness and takes into consideration loss that is inherent within the portfolio but has not been realized. The general allowance is determined by applying an expected loss percentage to various classes of loans with similar characteristics and classified loans that are not analyzed specifically for impairment. Because of the imprecision in calculating inherent and potential losses, the national and local economic conditions are also assessed to determine if the general allowance is adequate to cover losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries.  
    
  Deferred Income Taxes.   Deferred income taxes are reported for temporary differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in an institution's income tax returns. Deferred tax assets are deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards. After the deferred tax asset has been measured using the applicable enacted tax rate and provisions of the enacted tax law, it is then necessary to assess the need for a valuation allowance.  A valuation allowance is needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As required by GAAP, available evidence is weighted heavily on cumulative losses with less weight placed on future projected profitability. Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on whether there will be sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character in the period during which deductible temporary differences reverse or within the carryback and carryforward periods available under tax law. Based upon the available evidence, we carried no valuation allowance at September 30, 2016. The tax provision for the period is equal to the net change in the net deferred tax asset from the beginning to the end of the period, less amounts applicable to the change in value related to securities available-for-sale. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. The primary differences between financial statement income and taxable income result from REO, deferred loan fees and costs, and loan loss reserves.  
    
  Deferred income taxes do not include a liability for pre-1988 bad debt deductions allowed to thrift institutions that may be recaptured if the institution fails to qualify as a bank for income tax purposes in the future.  
    
  Real Estate Owned.   Real estate acquired through foreclosure is transferred to the real estate owned asset classification at fair value estimated fair market value less estimated costs of disposal and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or market. Any impairment on the initial transfer is charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Costs associated with real estate owned for maintenance, repair, property tax, etc., are expensed during the period incurred.  Assets held in real estate owned are reviewed quarterly for potential impairment. When impairment is indicated the impairment is charged against current period operating results and netted against the real estate owned to reflect a net book value.  At disposition any residual difference is either charged to current period earnings as a loss on sale or reflected as income in a gain on sale. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016    
    
  General.     Total assets increased by   $4.5 million  , or   1.0%  , to   $436.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $431.5 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  The increase in assets during this period was primarily a result of a $4.0 million, or 48.2% increase in cash and cash equivalents to $12.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $8.3 million at June 30, 2016 due to an increase in deposits.  In addition, loans receivable, net, increased $3.7 million, or 1.1%, to $351.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $347.4 million at June 30, 2016.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $1.1 million, or 4.5%, decline in securities available-for-sale comprised almost entirely of mortgage-backed securities, and a $920,000, or 82.7%, decline in prepaid expenses and other assets at September 30, 2016 as compared to June 30, 2016.  Total liabilities increased   $3.9 million  , or   1.1%  , to   $372.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $368.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  Total deposits increased   $3.3 million  , or   1.1%  , to $304.2

million at September 30, 2016 compared to $300.9 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of a $4.5 million, or 9.0% increase in noninterest bearing deposits to $55.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $50.8 million at June 30, 2016, partially offset by a $1.3 million, or 2.9%, decrease in savings deposits to $43.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $45.0 million at June 30, 2016. 
    
  Assets.   The following table details the increases and decreases in the composition of the Company's assets from   June 30, 2016   to   September 30, 2016  :     

Cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.0 million, or 48.2%, to $12.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $8.3 million at June 30, 2016 due to an increase in deposits. 
    
  Securities available-for-sale decreased   $1.1 million  , or   4.7%  , to $22.6 million at   September 30, 2016   from $23.7 million at   June 30, 2016  .  Securities held-to-maturity decreased $282,000, or   4.5%  , to   $6.0 million   at September 30, 2016 from $6.3 million at June 30, 2016.  The decreases in these portfolios were primarily the result of contractual principal repayments. 
    
  Loans receivable, net, increased $3.7 million, or 1.1%, to $351.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $347.4 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of new loan production exceeding principal reductions.  Construction loans increased $8.8 million, or 40.6%, to $30.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $21.8 million at June 30, 2016. There were $55.5 million in undisbursed construction loan commitments at September 30, 2016.  Multi-family loans increased $814,000, or 1.5%, to $54.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $53.7 million at June 30, 2016. Land loans increased $695,000, or 10.2%, to $7.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $6.8 million at June 30, 2016.  Consumer loans increased $69,000, or 0.3%, to $22.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $22.1 million at June 30, 2016.  Commercial real estate loans decreased $5.1 million, or 3.4%, to $144.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $149.5 million at June 30, 2016 partially due to the repayment of a $4.2 million commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel.  Also, we sold a $4.0 million participation interest in a commercial real estate loan which is secured by a parking structure.  One-to-four family loans decreased $1.2 million, or 1.9%, to $60.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $61.2 million at June 30, 2016. Commercial business loans decreased $160,000, or 0.4%, to $36.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $36.8 million at June 30, 2016.  
    
  Total delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more), increased $213,000 to $3.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.3 million at June 30, 2016.  Nonperforming loans, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, totaled $2.5 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $2.0 million at June 30, 2016. Total classified loans increased $412,000, or 14.8%, to $3.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million at June 30, 2016.

The decrease in the aggregate book value of REO properties during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from the prior quarter was primarily attributable to sales of three one-to-four family homes and one lot with a net book value of $269,000 resulting in a net gain on sale of $12,000.  At September 30, 2016, the largest REO property was a one-to-four family home in Thurston County, Washington with a carrying value of $168,000 which the Company acquired in August 2016. 
    
  Liabilities.    Total liabilities increased $3.9 million between June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016. Deposits increased $3.3 million, or 1.1%, to $304.2 million at   September 30, 2016   from $300.9 million at   June 30, 2016  .  Our core deposits, which consist of all deposits other than certificates of deposit, increased by $4.2 million, or 2.3%, to $186.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $182.5 million at June 30, 2016.

Stockholders'     Equity.    Total stockholders' equity increased $582,000, or 0.9%, to $63.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $63.2 million at June 30, 2016 primarily due to net income of $573,000.  Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $15,000 to $534,000 as a result of unrealized valuation changes on investments available-for-sale. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
    
  General.   Net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was $573,000 or $0.24 per diluted share compared to net income of $345,000 or $0.14 per diluted share for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Net Interest Income.   Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $557,000, or 15.8%, to $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year primarily due to the increase in average loans receivable.  Average loans receivable, net, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased $67.8 million, or 23.6%, to $355.1 million from $287.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  The Company's net interest margin increased slightly to 4.16% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from 4.15% for the comparable period in 2015 despite a three basis point decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 4.94% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 4.97% for the same period in 2015. The improvement in our net interest margin compared to the same quarter last year primarily reflects the increase in the average balance of loans receivable, net and the reduction in the weighted average cost of our FHLB advances to 1.00% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.20% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased six basis points to 0.99% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.05% for the same period in the prior year.  
    
  The following table sets forth the changes to our net interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, are allocated proportionately to the changes in rate and volume.

Interest Income.   Total interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased $625,000, or 14.8%, to $4.8 million from $4.2 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase during the period was primarily attributable to the increase in the average balance on loans receivable, net.  Average loans receivable, net, increased $67.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same quarter last year.  The average yield on loans receivable, net, decreased 36 basis points to 5.24% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 5.60% for the same period in the prior year.  Average mortgage-backed securities declined $6.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.  The average yield on mortgage-backed securities increased 20 basis points to 2.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.04% for the same period in the prior year.

Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased $68,000, or 9.7% to $768,000 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to $700,000 for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The average balance of certificates of deposit declined $7.6 million, or 6.1%, to $117.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $125.5 million for the same period of the prior year.  The average balance of FHLB advances increased $50.0 million, or 500.4%, to $60.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.0 million for the same quarter last year as these funds were primarily used to fund our loan growth over the last year.  The average cost of FHLB advances decreased 20 basis points to 1.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.20% for the same period of the prior year.  Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $42.5 million, or 15.9%, to   $309.7   million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $267.2 million for the same period in 2015.

Provision for Loan Losses.    In connection with its analysis of the loan portfolio, management determined that a $75,000 provision for loan losses was required for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $20,000 provision for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily reflecting our recent loan growth.  Nonperforming loans increased to $2.5 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $200,000 from $2.3 million at September 30, 2015. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.7% at September 30, 2016 compared to 0.8% at September 30, 2015.  Total classified loans increased $437,000, or 15.9%, to $3.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.7 million at September 30, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses of $3.8 million at September 30, 2016 represented 1.1% of loans receivable and 157.9% of nonperforming loans. This compares to an allowance of $3.8 million at June 30, 2016, representing 1.1% of loans receivable and 191.6% of nonperforming loans. 
    
  Management considers the allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

The following table details activity and information related to the allowance for loan losses at and for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

We continue to restructure our delinquent loans, when appropriate, so our borrowers can continue to make payments while minimizing the Company's potential loss.  As of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 there were 36 and 42 loans, respectively, with aggregate net principal balances of $7.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively, that we have identified as TDRs.  At September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 there were $876,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, of TDRs included in nonperforming loans. 
    
  Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased $114,000, or 10.9%, to $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.0 million for the same quarter a year ago. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  : 

The increase in noninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $91,000, or 63.2%, increase in loan fees in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to $235,000 compared to $144,000 for the same quarter a year ago primarily due to increased loan originations.  In addition, gain on sale of loans increased $40,000, or 65.6%, to $101,000 primarily due to increased sales in the secondary loan market. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $25,000 or 6.7%, to $348,000 for deposit service fees and a $24,000 or 15.4% decline in bank owned life insurance income as compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Noninterest Expense.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense increased $271,000, or 6.7%, to $4.3 million from $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The following table provides an analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Noninterest expense increased $271,000, or 6.7%, to $4.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $290,000, or 14.4%, increase in compensation benefits primarily due to $224,000 of stock based compensation awarded under the Anchor Bancorp 2015 Equity Plan. Information technology expenses increased $44,000, or 10.0% to $485,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $441,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the purchase of new loan production software. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $38,000 and no real estate impairments as compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily due to the decrease in  REO properties. 

Liquidity, Commitments and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity.   We are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Historically, we have maintained cash flow above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows. On a monthly basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.  
    
  Our primary sources of funds are from customer deposits, loan repayments, loan sales, investment payments, maturing investment securities and advances from the FHLB of Des Moines. These funds, together with retained earnings and equity, are used to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition.  
    
  We believe that our current liquidity position is sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments. At   September 30, 2016  , the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding were $14.5 million.  At the same date, unused lines of credit were $82.5 million.  
    
  For purposes of determining our liquidity position, we use the liquidity ratio, a regulatory measure of liquidity calculated as the total of net cash, short-term, and marketable assets divided by net deposits and short-term liabilities.  Our Board of Directors has established a liquidity ratio target of 10%.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our average liquidity ratio was 8.7%, which indicates we are below the liquidity standard set by our Board.  Management believes the Bank's current liquidity position is adequate to meet foreseeable short and long term liquidity requirements. 
    
  Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or mortgage-backed securities. On a longer-term basis, we maintain a  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

strategy of investing in various lending products. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals, to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities and investment securities.  
    
  Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at   September 30, 2016   totaled $43.7 million. We had no brokered deposits at   September 30, 2016  .  Management's policy is to generally maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with us. In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional $89.3 million from the FHLB of Des Moines.  We also have a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for $1.0 million which is collateralized with securities and a line of credit for $5.0 million with Pacific Coast Bankers' Bank. 
    
  We measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due. Liquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices, or in a reasonable time frame, to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and liabilities to manage effectively our liquidity and funding requirements. 
    
  Our primary source of funds is the Bank's deposits. When deposits are not available to provide the funds for our assets, we use alternative funding sources. These sources include, but are not limited to: cash management from the FHLB of Des Moines, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and dealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives.  Alternatively, we may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs. On a monthly basis, we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the coming three-month, nine-month, and one-year time periods. Also, we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our Asset Liability Management Committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities. 
    
  The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and provides for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. The Company's primary sources of income are dividends from the Bank, ESOP loan payments and ESOP loan interest income. During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Bank paid a $201,000 dividend to the Company.  The payment is being used for the Company's general corporate purposes, including supporting the Company's ongoing operations and stock repurchases.  At September 30, 2016, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $2.5 million. 
    
  Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.   We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Because some commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Collateral is not required to support commitments.  
    
  Undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects. Unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed, but committed for, home equity, commercial and consumer lines of credit. 
    
  Commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily used to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.

  Operating lease commitment   - The Bank leases space for branches and operations located in Shelton, Puyallup, and Seattle Washington. These leases run for periods ranging from three to five years. All leases require the Bank to pay all taxes, maintenance, and utility costs, as well as maintain certain types of insurance. The annual lease commitments for the next five years are as follows:  

Capital.   Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, we actively seek to maintain a  well capitalized  institution in accordance with regulatory standards.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with, Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1), Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of   13.3%  ,   14.3%  ,   14.3%  , and   15.3%  , respectively.  As of June 30, 2016 these ratios were 13.5%, 14.7%, 14.7%, and 15.7%, respectively.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank met the requirements to be deemed "well-capitalized" under applicable regulatory guidelines. 
    
  In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank now has to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in January 2019. 
    
  Anchor Bancorp exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, CET1, Tier 1 Risk- Based Capital and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of   14.2%  ,   15.3%  ,   15.3%  , and   16.2%  , respectively, as of September 30, 2016.  As of June 30, 2016, these ratios were 14.4%, 15.7%, 15.7% and 16.6%, respectively.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk 
    
  General.   Our Board of Directors has established an asset and liability management policy to guide management in maximizing net interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate sensitivity, changes in net interest income, credit risk and profitability. The policy includes the use of an Asset Liability Management Committee whose members include certain members of senior management. The Committee s purpose is to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability positions consistent with our business plan and Board-approved policies. The Asset Liability Management Committee meets monthly to review various areas including: 

economic conditions; 
                
    interest rate outlook; 
                
    asset/liability mix; 
                
    interest rate risk sensitivity; 
                
    change in net interest income; 
                
    current market opportunities to promote specific products; 
                
    historical financial results; 
                
    projected financial results; and 
                
    capital position. 
       
  The Committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs monthly. As part of its procedures, the Asset Liability Management Committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the Board of Directors. 
    
  Our Risk When Interest Rates Change.   The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. 
    
  In recent years, we primarily have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have: 

increased our originations of shorter term loans and particularly, home equity loans (limited recent originations) and commercial business loans; 
                
    structured certain borrowings with maturities that match fund our loan portfolios; and 
                
    sold our fixed rate single family loans to generate noninterest income as well as managing interest rate risk. 
       
  How We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes.   We measure our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis utilizing an internal model. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from such assumptions. The assumptions we use are based upon proprietary and market data and reflect historical results and current market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios.  An independent service was used to provide market rates of interest and certain interest rate assumptions to determine prepayments and maturities of loans, investments and borrowings and decay rates on deposits. Time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We assumed that non-maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates. 
    
  In the past, we have demonstrated that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively low volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits. Our deposit accounts are tiered by balance and rate, whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest.  Therefore, deposits that are not very rate sensitive (generally, lower balance tiers) are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive (generally, higher balance tiers). 
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

We generally have found that a number of our deposit accounts are less rate sensitive than others. Thus, when interest rates increase, the interest rates paid on these deposit accounts do not require a proportionate increase in order for us to retain them. These assumptions are based upon an analysis of our customer base, competitive factors and historical experience. The following table shows the change in our net portfolio value at   September 30, 2016   that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates based on our assumptions, but without giving effect to any steps that we might take to counteract that change. The net portfolio value is calculated based upon the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities. The difference between the present value of assets and liabilities is the net portfolio value and represents the market value of equity for the given interest rate scenario. Net portfolio value is useful for determining, on a market value basis, how much equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios. Large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams.

    Represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates. 
       (2)   
    Calculated as the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets ( net portfolio value ratio ). 
       (3)   
    Calculated as the increase (decrease) in the net portfolio value ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates over the estimated net portfolio value ratio assuming no change in interest rates. 
       (4)   
    Calculated based on the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets. The market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes. 

The following table illustrates the change in net interest income that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates at   September 30, 2016  , but without giving effect to any steps that might be taken to counter the effect of that change in interest rates. 

(1)       Represents the increase (decrease) of the estimated net interest income at the indicated change in interest rates compared to net interest income assuming no change in interest rates. 
    
  We use certain assumptions in assessing our interest rate risk. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. 
    
  As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates.  Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, if interest rates change, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  An evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Company's management team as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in     the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. 
    
  (b) Changes in Internal Controls. 
    
  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company also continued to implement suggestions from its internal auditor and independent auditors to strengthen existing controls.  
    
  The Company intends to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and to improve its controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that it may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company's business. While the Company believes the present design of its disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent every error or instance of fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
