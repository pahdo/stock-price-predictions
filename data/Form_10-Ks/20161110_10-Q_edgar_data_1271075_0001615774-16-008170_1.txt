Note 1 - Organization and Business   

uSell.com, Inc., through
its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively,  uSell,  or the  Company ), is a technology driven company
focused on extracting the maximum value from used mobile devices, at large scale. uSell acquires products from both individual
consumers, on its website, uSell.com, and from major carriers, big box retailers, and manufacturers through its subsidiary, We
Sell Cellular, LLC ( We Sell Cellular ). These devices are then distributed globally, leveraging both a traditional
sales force and an online marketplace where professional buyers of used smartphones compete to buy inventory in an on-demand fashion.
Through participation on uSell s marketplace platforms and through interaction with uSell s salesforce, buyers can
acquire high volumes of inventory in a cost effective manner, while minimizing risk. 

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information
or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management s
opinion, however, that the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments,
consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results
and cash flows for the periods presented. 

The accompanying unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto,
together with Management s Discussion and Analysis, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The financial information
as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future interim periods. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The accompanying unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of uSell and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Segment Information  

Operating segments are
identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the
chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company and its Chief Executive Officer
view the Company s operations and manage its business as one operating segment. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Making estimates requires
management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition,
situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements,
which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

All highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents generally consist of money market accounts.

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts
receivable represent obligations from the Company s customers and are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts,
doubtful accounts, and actual sales returns. The Company s policy is to reserve for uncollectible accounts based on its
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews
its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on an analysis of past due
accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to
be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for
recovery is considered remote. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,600 and $14,300 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. 

Inventory  

Inventory, comprised
of all finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost (average cost method) or market. Inventory is recorded net of allowances. 

Allowances for slow-moving
or obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience of a variety of factors, including sales volume, product life
and levels of inventory at the end of the period. The allowance for slow-moving or obsolete inventory amounted to $63,000 and $0
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Substantially all
of the Company s inventory purchases are paid for before inventory is received in the Company s warehouse. Prepaid
inventory amounted to approximately $93,000 and $133,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included
in inventory, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized
when all of the following conditions exist: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the
sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Principal Device
Revenue  

The Company,
through We Sell Cellular, generates revenue from the sales of its cellular telephones and related equipment. The Company
recognizes revenue  FOB shipping point  on such sales. Delivery to the customer is deemed to have occurred when
the customer takes title to the product. Generally, title passes to the customer when the products leave the Company s
warehouse. Payment terms generally require payment once an order is placed. The Company allows customers to return product
within 30 days of shipment if the product is defective. Allowances for product returns are recorded as a reduction of sales
at the time revenue is recognized based on historical data. The estimate of the allowance for product returns amounted to
approximately $109,000 and $197,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is recorded in accrued
expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Under the Company s
 Managed by uSell  service on uSell.com, the Company partnered with a third party logistics company to inspect, wipe
and process devices before passing them along to buyers. Under this model, title to a device passes to uSell upon issuance of payment
to the seller, which is generally within one to two days from the receipt of the device at the third party warehouse. Title to
a device is then transferred to the buyer upon shipment to the buyer. 

Agent Commission Revenue  

In certain cases,
sellers on the Company s uSell.com website are shown a larger list of offers directly from third party buyers interested
in purchasing their devices. These offers are shown instead of or in addition to the  Managed by uSell  offer. If a
seller chooses one of these offers, the seller will ship their device directly to the buyer, rather than to the Company s
third party warehouse. The buyer is then responsible for testing the device, servicing the customer, and ultimately paying the
seller for the device or returning it. The Company charges a commission to the buyers only when the seller sends in a device and
is successfully paid for it. As such, the Company recognizes Agent Commission Revenue upon payment to the seller. 

Fulfillment Revenue  

The Company offers
fulfillment services on behalf of its buyers for the items sold using the Agent Commission Revenue approach outlined above. The
Company acts as the agent in these fulfillment services transactions, passing orders booked by its buyers to its third party fulfillment
vendor, who then assembles the kits and mails them directly to the sellers. The Company earns a standard fee from its buyers and
recognizes revenue upon shipment of the kits to the sellers. The Company evaluated the presentation of revenue on a gross versus
net basis and determined that since the Company performs as an agent without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis.

Advertising Revenue  

Advertising revenues
primarily come from payments for text-based sponsored links and display advertisements. Generally, the Company s advertisers
pay the Company on a cost per click, or CPC basis, which means advertisers pay only when someone clicks on one of their advertisements,
or on a cost per thousand impression basis, or CPM. Paying on a CPM basis means that advertisers pay the Company based on the number
of times their advertisements appear on the Company s websites or mobile applications. Advertising revenue is recognized
as income when the advertising services are rendered. 

Deferred revenue represents
amounts billed to customers or payments received from customers prior to providing services and for which the related revenue recognition
criteria have not been met. 

Shipping and Handling
Costs  

The Company follows
the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605-45 regarding shipping and handling costs. Shipping
and handling costs included in cost of revenue were approximately $108,000, and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and $336,000 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Advertising  

Advertising costs
are expensed as they are incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses. Advertising expense amounted to approximately
$11,000 and $22,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $41,000 and $1,293,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Concentration of
Credit Risk  

Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. 

The Company minimizes
credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institutions. At times,
the Company s cash may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
insurance limit. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had not experienced losses on these accounts and management
believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. 

Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to accounts receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers comprising the Company s customer
base and generally short payment terms. 

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments  

Financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at cost, which management
believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of debt approximates its carrying
amounts as a market rate of interest is attached to the repayment. 

Net Loss per Share  

Basic loss per share
( EPS ) is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to
all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, including stock options and warrants, using the
treasury stock method, and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes
all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.

The computation of
diluted EPS excludes the common stock equivalents of the following potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would
be anti-dilutive: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows: Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which eliminates the
diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding
or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon
debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest
rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance
claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies);
distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable
cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 206-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-15 provides for retrospective application for all periods presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ), which further amended ASU 2016-09 by providing additional clarity in recognizing
revenue from contracts that have been modified prior to the transition period to the new standard, as well as providing additional
disclosure requirements for businesses and other organizations that make the transition to the new standard by adjusting amounts
from prior reporting periods via retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this standard
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 
( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10 clarifies two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance obligations; and (b) the
licensing implementation guidance. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim
reporting periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and
affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as
the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash
flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify
for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This guidance can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively
or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net  ( ASU 2014-09 ). The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability
of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU
2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Private entities
must apply the amendments one year later. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated
financial statements.

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ) .  Under the new guidance, at the commencement
date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising
from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right
to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term
of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted
upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases)
must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition
accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective
transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015,
the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments 
( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminates the current guidance that requires an acquirer in a business combination to account
for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed at the
acquisition date. Instead, under the new guidance, an acquirer recognizes measurement-period adjustments in the period in which
it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous
periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 does not change the criteria for determining
whether an adjustment qualifies as a measurement-period adjustment or change the length of the measurement period, which cannot
exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2015, and the guidance is applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the adoption date. The
Company adopted ASU 2015-16 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance impacted the Company s accounting for its
measurement-period adjustment in connection with the Well Sell Cellular acquisition during the nine months ended September 30,
2016, as described in Note 3. 

In July 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  simplifying the measurement of inventory . 
The guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which consists of estimated
selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.
The new guidance eliminates unnecessary complexity that exists under current  lower of cost or market  guidance. For
public entities, ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The guidance is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period, with
early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements and disclosures. 

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standard Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 provides guidance for revenue recognition and affects any entity that either enters into
contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance. The
core principle of ASU 2014-09 is the recognition of revenue when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, companies will need to use more judgment
and make more estimates than under the current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract,
estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each
separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 was initially effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim

of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach

Note 3 - Acquisition   

On October 26, 2015
(the  Closing Date ), the Company acquired BST Distribution, Inc., a New York corporation ( BST ), which
owns We Sell Cellular, and is engaged primarily in the wholesale acquisition and resale of smartphones and related devices from
carriers and big box stores. In connection with the We Sell Cellular acquisition, the Company, BST and We Sell Cellular entered
into a financing transaction on October 26, 2015 with BAM Administrative Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( BAM ),
as agent, and an institutional investor (the  Purchaser ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold the Purchaser
a note in the principal amount of $4,040,000. 

The Company, BST,
and Brian Tepfer and Scott Tepfer (together, the  Tepfers ) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  SPA )
as a result of which BST became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The SPA and the related transactions, other than the
financing transaction, were effective as of October 1, 2015. Prior to closing of the SPA, the Tepfers owned 100% of the outstanding
stock of BST, which owns 100% of the membership interests of We Sell Cellular. In exchange for acquiring 100% of the outstanding
stock of BST, the Company issued the Tepfers 9,358,837 shares of the Company s common stock, subject to adjustment as described
below. 

In accordance with
the SPA, if the Tepfers elected to sell shares of the Company s common stock, the Company would use its best efforts to assist
the Tepfers in selling their shares of common stock acquired under the SPA for up to $6,000,000 in gross proceeds (together and
not each) through private placements or public offerings, with target sales of $1,500,000 quarterly, commencing with the quarter
ending December 31, 2015 (the  Placement Rights ). If the price per share received by the Tepfers was less than the
greater of $1.20 or the product of an EBITDA-based formula, the Company would have been required to issue the Tepfers additional
shares of common stock. The Tepfers did not elect to sell shares of common stock during the quarter ending December 31, 2015 and
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The fair value of
the Placement Rights was determined assuming the Tepfers sold their shares of common stock evenly over four quarters, as permitted
under the SPA. Accordingly, the Placement Rights were valued as if they expired on the dates the shares of common stock were sold
(see Note 10). In accordance with ASC 480-10,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity,  the Placement Rights were treated as a derivative liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheet because the Company was unable to determine if it would have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to deliver
to the Tepfers. 

On July 27, 2016,
the Company entered into an agreement with the Tepfers pursuant to which, effective July 1, 2016, the Tepfers agreed to waive the
Placement Rights granted to them under the SPA. Accordingly, the derivative liability pertaining to the Placement Rights was eliminated
with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital (see Note 10). 

In addition, pursuant
to the SPA, the Company granted the Tepfers certain piggyback registration rights and a right of first refusal to participate in
future Company financings. The Company also created a pool of 300,000 restricted stock units which can be granted to employees
of We Sell Cellular designated by the Tepfers. 

The We Sell Cellular
acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities
were recorded at their estimated fair values, and operating results for We Sell Cellular are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the effective date of acquisition of October 26, 2015. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment to the value of the inventory acquired that existed prior to the acquisition.
As a result of the adjustment, the Company recorded an increase in goodwill of $42,198 during the nine months ended September 30,
2016.

Note 6 - Promissory Notes   

At September 30, 2016,
the Company s Notes (as defined below) is comprised of the following: 

On October 23, 2015
(the  Note Closing Date ), in connection with the closing of the SPA and related transactions, the Company, BST, We
Sell Cellular, BAM, as agent, and the Purchaser, an institutional investor, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the  NPA )
pursuant to which the Company issued and sold the Purchaser a 1% original issue discount Secured Term Note in the aggregate principal
amount of $4,040,000 (the  Initial Note ) in exchange for gross proceeds of $4,000,000.  

Within six months of
the Note Closing Date, the Company was permitted to receive up to two additional draws of funds in connection with the issuance
of additional 1% original issue discount Secured Term Note (the  Deferred Draw Notes,  and with the  Initial
Note,  the  Notes ). The NPA provides that the Company could elect to receive a total of another $4,000,000 under
the Deferred Draw Notes in compliance with the covenants under the NPA. The proceeds of the Notes may be used for working capital
and other general corporate purposes. 

The Notes mature three
years from the Note Closing Date and accrue interest at 13.25% annually, which is payable monthly in arrears, beginning November
1, 2015. Repayment of principal originally commenced seven months from the Note Closing Date in monthly installments of 1/48 th 
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (see below). The Notes are prepayable at 103%, beginning one year from the Note
Closing Date, in increments of $500,000. 

In connection with the
issuance of the Initial Note, the Company issued the Purchaser 740,000 shares of its common stock. On December 1, 2015, the Company
elected to borrow an additional $2,000,000 and issued the Purchaser a Deferred Draw Note in the principal amount of $2,020,000
and issued the Purchaser an additional 120,000 shares of common stock. 

The Company maintains
a dedicated bank account with a third party custodian pursuant to which all accounts receivable and Collateral proceeds (as defined
in the NPA) are deposited to this account. The Company can only access funds in this account in accordance with the terms of the
NPA. This account is controlled by BAM and is presented as restricted cash in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

On March 30, 2016,
the Company received $2,000,000 in connection with the issuance of a Secured Term Note in the original principal amount of $2,020,000
(the  Second Deferred Draw Note ) under the terms of the Company s original NPA. In connection with the closing
of the Second Deferred Draw Note, the Purchaser was issued an additional 350,000 shares of restricted common stock, consisting
of the 120,000 shares required by the original NPA for the issuance of the Second Deferred Draw Note, and an additional 230,000
shares as consideration for the covenant modifications referenced below. The Company paid an additional $31,000 of costs in connection
with the closing of the Second Deferred Draw Note. 

On March 31, 2016,
the Company amended the terms of its NPA with BAM, and the Purchaser, pursuant to which the Company received the following modifications
of covenants applicable to the credit facility: 

The EBITDA covenants will not apply until September 2017;   

The amortization period of the principal will not commence until September 1, 2017;   

The interest rate was increased by one-quarter of one percent (25 basis points) from 13.0% to 13.25%;   

The Company will get 75% credit for new purchase orders towards the borrowing base of the facility instead of the previous 50%; and   

The Company will get a 90% credit for inventory in transit towards the borrowing base instead of the previous 75%.   

The Company analyzed
the modification in accordance with ASC 405-20 and ASC 470-50-40. As the present value of the future cash flows of the modified
debt was less than 10% different than the cash flows of the original debt, it was determined that the original and new debt instruments
are not substantially different. Accordingly, the Company did not treat the original NPA as having been extinguished and exchanged
for a new NPA.

The Company determined
the value of the 1,210,000 shares of common stock issued to the Purchaser to be $1,128,300, based upon the quoted closing trading
price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The issuance of the 1,210,000 shares of common stock has been treated
as a debt issue cost and, accordingly, has been recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of Notes and is being amortized
to interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, accretion
of the costs amounted to $100,000 and $260,000, respectively.

contractual term of the Notes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, accretion of the fees amounted to $25,000
and $69,000, respectively. 

Note 7   Capital Lease Obligations   

We are obligated under a capital lease under
which the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments amounted to $55,000. The present value of the minimum lease payments
was calculated using a discount rate of 5.18%. The future minimum lease payments under the capital lease at September 30, 2016

Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements   

The fair value of
the Company s financial assets and liabilities reflects management s estimate of amounts that the Company would have
received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of the Company s assets
and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and
to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).
The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs
used in order to value the assets and liabilities: 

uSell.com, Inc and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
September 30, 2016 
(Unaudited)  

Level 1:  
      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.   
 
      Level 2:  
      Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.   
 
      Level 3:  
      Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   

The following table
presents information about the Company s liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such
fair value: 

Level 3 liabilities
are valued using unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of
the derivative liabilities. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company s
Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, determines its valuation policies and procedures. The development
and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility
of the Company s Chief Financial Officer and is approved by the Chief Executive Officer. 

The Company has determined
the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment
is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative
of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The Company has based these fair value estimates
on pertinent information available as of the respective balance sheet dates and has determined that, as of such dates, the carrying
value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. 

Level 3 Valuation Techniques:  

Level 3 financial liabilities
consist of placement right liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of
fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Changes in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. 

The Company uses the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to value Level 3 financial liabilities at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This
model incorporates transaction details such as the Company s stock price, contractual terms, maturity, and risk free rates,
as well as volatility. 

A significant increase
in the volatility or a significant increase in the Company s stock price, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher
fair value measurement. Changes in the values of the derivative liabilities are recorded in  change in fair value of placement
right derivative liability  in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy. 

The placement right liability was valued
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions on the following dates:

The following table reflects the change
in fair value of the Company s derivative liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

As discussed in Note
3, on July 27, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with the Tepfers pursuant to which, effective July 1, 2016, the Tepfers
agreed to waive the Placement Rights granted to them under the SPA. Accordingly, the Company recorded an expense of $370,000 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing the change in the fair value of the derivative liability pertaining to the
Placement Rights through July 1, 2016 and, as the derivative liability was eliminated on July 1, 2016, recorded $1,500,000 as additional
paid in capital. 

Note 11   Subsequent Events   

The Company evaluates
subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued
for potential recognition or disclosure. The Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment
or disclosure in the financial statements. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes
appearing elsewhere in this report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth under  Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
on March 30, 2016. These Risk Factors noted our reliance on one supplier which accounted for 94% of our purchases. Although we
have reduced our dependence on this supplier to 62% of purchases for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we remain dependent
on suppliers and any material reduction without the ability to replace them with new suppliers and maintain acceptable margins
could have a material adverse effect upon us.

Overview  

uSell.com, Inc. is
a technology driven company focused on extracting the maximum value from used mobile devices, at large scale. uSell acquires products
from both individual consumers, on its website, uSell.com, and from major carriers, big box retailers, and manufacturers through
its subsidiary, We Sell Cellular, LLC. These devices are then distributed globally, leveraging both a traditional sales force and
an online marketplace where professional buyers of used smartphones compete to buy inventory in an on-demand fashion. Through participation
on uSell s marketplace platforms and through interaction with uSell s salesforce, buyers can acquire high volumes of
inventory in a cost effective manner, while minimizing risk. 

Device Acquisition  

uSell has two primary
means of sourcing devices to fuel its marketplace and satisfy demand from its global base of customers. The first source is through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, We Sell Cellular, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. We Sell Cellular is among a handful
of top tier wholesalers whose primary business is to buy used smartphones that have been traded in with the major carriers and
the big box retailers, fully inspect and grade these devices, and then sell these devices wholesale and retail through its highly
experienced sales force. We Sell Cellular is one of a few wholesalers that has qualified for R2 certification, the industry standard
for both data destruction and environmental protection. 

uSell s second
method of sourcing devices is through its website, uSell.com, where individual consumers can find cash offers for their items based
on the make, model, and condition of each item. Upon accepting an offer, consumers can ship their devices for free using either
a prepaid shipping kit or shipping label, and then track the progress of their orders online from initiation to final payment of
their devices. We have historically utilized consumer oriented advertising efforts, such as direct response television commercials
and various forms of Internet advertising, to attract sellers to our website. However, during 2015, we decided to strategically
reduce our marketing spend in favor of seeking out wholesale supply. 

Device Disposition  

We sell devices through
three primary means: 

Utilizing our proprietary marketplace bidding platforms where buyers can source devices on demand   

Employing our highly experienced sales force to sell devices to its global client base   

Leveraging third party eCommerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon   

While a minority of
our product is sold directly to consumers via third party eCommerce platforms, the majority of our sales are to professional, wholesale
buyers. These buyers include brick and mortar retailers, online retailers, large and small wholesalers, small repair shops, large
refurbishing providers, and insurance companies. Approximately two-thirds of our customer base is in the United States, with the balance
abroad. We are able to provide all of our buyers with a low risk, cost-efficient way to acquire inventory. Through participation
in the uSell marketplace or through interaction with our salesforce, our buyers gain access to the high volume of devices that
we acquire through both retail and wholesale means, without taking on the risk and investment involved in marketing directly to
consumers or purchasing directly from carriers, big box retailers, and manufacturers. 

Revenue Model  

We generate revenue
by either taking possession of devices and selling these devices for a premium ( Principal Device Revenue ) or by facilitating
transactions between buyers and sellers and collecting a commission ( Agent Commission Revenue ). 

A part of our retail
business utilizes an Agent Commission Revenue model, whereby we do not take possession of the devices that are sold to us by consumers,
but rather facilitate transactions between these consumers and our network of professional buyers. Some of the devises we acquire
through our retail business, however, utilize our Managed by uSell service, whereby we partner with a third party logistics company
to inspect and process devices before passing them along to buyers offering the highest prices for each device. Through this approach,
we take possession of devices for a brief period of time before they are passed on to the ultimate buyer. 

Devices sourced wholesale
through our subsidiary, We Sell Cellular, are all bought and sold using the Principal Device Revenue model. Given that our wholesale
sourcing channel is substantially larger than our retail sourcing channel, the vast majority of our business is characterized by
the Principal Device Revenue approach. 

Critical
Accounting Policies  

In response to financial
reporting release FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, from the SEC, we have selected
our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate,
in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on the our financial condition. The
accounting estimates involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations
and financial condition. Our more significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2 of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements found elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
as filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies during the period covered by this
report.  

Results of Operations  

2016 Financial Highlights  

As a result of the
We Sell Cellular acquisition in October 2015, our business was fundamentally transformed and our financial situation substantially
improved. Key financial metrics were as follows: 

We saw
improvement in our quarter over quarter gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The third quarter of
2016 was a period of low supply in the industry, which drove up selling prices and our margins. We were also able to make
opportunistic purchases during the quarter that substantially improved our margins. Lastly, we were benefited by the fact
that we were able to liquidate most of the inventory associated with our first quarter write down prior to the start of the
third quarter. 

From a technology
perspective, we continued to successfully run online auctions for a certain subset of We Sell Cellular s product. We also
began putting the building blocks in place to begin migrating more of We Sell Cellular s volume online. In particular, we
launched an  Online Stock List,  where buyers can log into their accounts and view our inventory on demand. We also
consolidated and streamlined our processes for lead capture, lead management, prospect management, and customer relationship management.
In the short term, this will enable our salesforce to focus on high value activities, such as acquiring new customers and increasing
customer engagement and retention. In the long term, these systems are critical to managing our customer interactions as we migrate
more customers onto our online platforms. 

On the supplier side,
we continued to make great strides, as our largest supplier s share of our purchases dropped from 85% in the second quarter
of 2016 to 62% in the third quarter of 2016. We view supplier diversification as a long term initiative that will be measured over
the next 12-24 months. 

Comparison of the Three and Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The following tables
set forth, for the periods indicated, results of operations information from our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements: 

Revenue by Type   

The following table breaks down our revenue
by type: 

Principal Device Revenue
increased by $22,126,000, or 853%, from $2,595,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $24,721,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. Agent Commission Revenue increased by $32,000, or 74%, from $43,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015 to $75,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Principal Device Revenue related to We Sell Cellular amounted
to $23,761,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Principal Device
Revenue increased by $66,142,000, or 975%, from $6,781,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $72,923,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Agent Commission Revenue decreased by $389,000, or 79%, from $495,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to $106,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Principal Device Revenue related to We Sell
Cellular amounted to $69,060,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Due to the fact that
devices sourced through We Sell Cellular are bought and sold using the Principal Device Revenue model, we anticipate that the
percentage of the Agent Commission Revenue will remain minimal for the foreseeable future, as we continue to increase the volume
that we purchase through wholesale channels. 

Cost of Revenue   

Cost of revenue increased
by $20,585,000 or 951% from $2,165,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $22,750,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Cost of revenue increased by $62,555,000 or 1,085% from $5,764,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 to $68,319,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of revenue related to We Sell Cellular amounted to $21,787,000
and $64,668,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Cost of revenue pertaining to the sale of
devices through our Managed by uSell service includes the cost of acquiring the device, as well as any other direct costs and expenses
required to inspect and process the devices internally before shipping them to the buyers. Furthermore, with the acquisition of
We Sell Cellular we saw a substantial increase in Principal Device Revenue associated with the wholesale acquisition and sale of
devices. Accordingly, our cost of revenue has increased substantially. Cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 includes a $116,000 and $104,000 recovery for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, respectively. 

Gross profit increased
substantially to 8.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 7.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 4.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Any comparison prior to the We Sell Cellular acquisition in October 2015 would
not be meaningful. As noted above, margins improved during the second and third quarter of 2016, confirming that the margin pressure
that we experienced in the first quarter was not a trend, but rather a cyclical event triggered by the unanticipated launch of
the iPhone SE. The margin improvement in the third quarter of 2016 was also driven by opportunistic purchases that we were able
to make from new suppliers. Given that the market was experiencing a supply shortage, we benefitted greatly from our ability to
purchase at favorable prices. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses   

Sales and marketing
expense increased $414,000, or 753%, from $55,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $469,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Sales and marketing include $459,000 of expenses related to We Sell Cellular for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. With the We Sell Cellular acquisition and our newfound ability to source devices directly from the carriers,
retailers, and manufacturers, our primary sales and marketing expenses have shifted from consumer marketing to paying out sales
commissions. We believe this shifting profile will enable us to scale volume significantly while maintaining sales and marketing
expense as a much lower percentage of sales than in prior years. 

Sales and marketing
expense decreased $150,000, or 11%, from $1,410,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,260,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. While the decrease in spend between 2015 and 2016 is not material between periods, the nature
of the spend is substantially different, and is much smaller as a percentage of overall sales. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative
expenses include professional fees for technology, legal and accounting services as well as consulting and internal personnel costs
for our back office support functions. General and administrative expenses are impacted by non-cash compensation expense pertaining
to stock grants and option grants for services. Non-cash compensation expense amounted to $92,000 and $196,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $364,000 and $654,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Excluding non-cash compensation
expense, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $899,000, or 160%, compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to the acquisition of We Sell Cellular in October
2015. General and administrative expenses include $964,000 of expenses (inclusive of $365,000 of depreciation and amortization
expense) related to the acquisition of We Sell Cellular during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased by $365,000, from $1,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $366,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, mainly as a result of the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the We Sell Cellular
acquisition. Not included in this amount is $140,000 and $130,000 of amortization expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to our capitalized technology, which is included in cost of revenues. Offsetting the increase
in general and administrative expenses are professional fees of approximately $109,000 that were included in the three months ended
September 30, 2015 related to the We Sell Cellular acquisition. 

Excluding non-cash compensation
expense, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2,194,000, or 108%, compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to the acquisition of We Sell Cellular in October
2015. General and administrative expenses include $2,706,000 of expenses (inclusive of $1,100,000 of depreciation and amortization
expense) related to the acquisition of We Sell Cellular during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased by $1,098,000, from $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,102,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, mainly as a result of the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the We Sell Cellular
acquisition. Not included in this amount is $402,000 and $430,000 of amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, related to our capitalized technology, which is included in cost of revenues. Offsetting the increase
in general and administrative expenses is a decrease in salary and salary-related expenses of $396,000 resulting from the reduction
in our marketing headcount during 2015 and a decrease in professional fees of $109,000 incurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2015 related to the We Sell Cellular acquisition that are not included in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other Income (Expense)   

Other expense during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised of ($405,000) and ($1,090,000), respectively, of interest expense
primarily attributable to the NPA entered into in October 2015 in connection with the We Sell Cellular acquisition and $0 and $370,000,
respectively, related to the change in the fair value of the Placement Rights derivative liability. See Note 3 to our unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of the rights. On July 27, 2016, we entered into an agreement
with the Tepfers pursuant to which, effective July 1, 2016, the Tepfers agreed to waive the Placement Rights granted to them under
the SPA. Accordingly, the derivative liability pertaining to the Placement Rights was eliminated with a corresponding credit to
additional paid in capital. 

We did not have significant
other income (expense) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted EBITDA  

We make reference to
 Adjusted EBITDA,  a measure of financial performance not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s
performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded
in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Reconciliations of this
non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net loss, to the extent available without unreasonable
effort, are set forth below. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings or (loss) from continuing operations before the items
noted in the table below. 

Management believes
Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance that provides useful information to investors
regarding our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others
to measure operating performance. Furthermore, management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure may provide investors with
additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of
our core ongoing business. However, while we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, Adjusted
EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute
for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, may not be comparable to EBITDA,
or similarly titled measures, as defined by other companies. 

The following table
presents Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, and provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the directly comparable
GAAP measure reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We do not yet have a
sustained history of financial stability. Historically, our principal source of liquidity has been the issuances of debt and equity
securities (including to related parties), including preferred stock, common stock and various debt financing transactions. We
believe that with our acquisition of We Sell Cellular and our current available cash, along with the continued increase in revenues,
we will have sufficient funds to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. 

There can be no assurance
that the plans and actions proposed by management will be successful and that we will generate profitability and positive cash
flows in the future. 

Our cash flow has
been significantly impacted by the We Sell Cellular acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, we entered into an $8 million
financing facility, of which we have borrowed the full $8 million as of September 30, 2016. The proceeds were used, in part, to
fund the acquisition of We Sell Cellular, in order for them to repay a previously existing bank loan, repay an amount due to one
of the founders of We Sell Cellular and for the purchase of inventory. The remaining proceeds have been primarily used for the
purchase of inventory and working capital needs. The Company is required to begin repaying the principal of this loan in 1/48 th 
increments beginning September 1, 2017 until the maturity date of October 23, 2018. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

Operating activities
provided $2,231,000 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease from $1,281,000 of cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,535,000
was offset by $1,504,000 of depreciation and amortization, $370,000 due to the change in the fair value of the Placement Rights
derivative liability, $364,000 of stock-based compensation, $348,000 of amortization of debt issue costs related to our NPA and
$112,000 from the loss on the disposal of property and equipment. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $2,069,000
of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $2,299,000
was offset by $654,000 of stock-based compensation and $433,000 of depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets and
liabilities used $70,000 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we capitalized $435,000 of website development costs, compared to $468,000 in 2015, we purchased $69,000
of property and equipment in connection with our move to our new warehouse location, and our restricted cash account increased
by $3,528,000 as a result of our requirement under the NPA to maintain a dedicated bank account controlled by BAM, the agent of
our lender. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we received $2,000,000 in proceeds under our NPA and paid $50,000 in costs associated with the NPA. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid $75,000 in costs associated with the NPA.
