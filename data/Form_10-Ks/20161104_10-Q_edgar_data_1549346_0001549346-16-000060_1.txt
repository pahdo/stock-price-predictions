(1) Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies 
  Summary of Operations 
  Shutterstock, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  Shutterstock ), operates a global marketplace and is a leading provider of high-quality creative content including: (a) digital imagery, which consists of licensed photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips that customers use in their visual communications, such as websites, digital and print marketing materials, corporate communications, books, publications and video content; and (b) commercial music, which consists of high-quality music tracks and sound effects, and is often used to complement the digital imagery. The Company licenses creative content to its customers. Contributors upload their creative content to the Company s websites in exchange for royalty payments based on customer download activity. The Company also offers digital asset management services through its cloud-based digital asset management platform, WebDAM. This service provides tools for customers to better manage creative content and brand management assets.  
  In recent years, the Company has grown, in part, through acquisitions, most notably through the acquisition of WebDAM in 2014 and the acquisitions of Rex Features and PremiumBeat in 2015. The Company is headquartered in New York City with offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, London, Los Angeles, Montreal, Paris, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  
  The interim consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , included herein, was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the Company s annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and its consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The financial data and the other financial information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements related to these periods are also unaudited. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016   or for any other future annual or interim period. 
  There have been   no   material changes in the significant accounting policies from those that were disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on   February 24, 2016  . These financial statements should also be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain immaterial changes in presentation have been made to conform the prior period presentation to current period reporting.

Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. The Company evaluates its significant estimates on an ongoing basis, including, but not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts, sales refund reserve, accruals related to self-insurance, the fair value of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, the fair value of contingent consideration, the provision for income taxes and the amount of certain non-income tax accruals. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Restricted Cash 
  The Company s restricted cash relates to security deposits for its office leases. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had restricted cash of approximately   $2.6 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, in other assets that related to the lease for its headquarters in New York City, which expires in   2029  . In January 2016, this lease was amended to provide additional space and extend the lease term, which required an increased security deposit. The carrying value of restricted cash approximates fair value. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  The Company s accounts receivable consist of customer obligations due under normal trade terms, carried at their face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts, if required. The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the aging of its accounts receivable and on a customer-by-customer basis where appropriate. The Company s reserve analysis contemplates the Company s historical loss rate on receivables, specific customer situations and the economic environments in which the Company operates. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately   $6.2 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, which was included as a reduction of accounts receivable.  
  Deferred Rent 
  The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the rent expense recognized and the actual payments made in accordance with the lease agreement is recognized as a deferred rent liability on the Company s balance sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had deferred rent of   $8.1 million   which was included in other non-current liabilities. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had deferred rent of   $8.0 million  , of which   $0.7 million   was included in other liabilities and   $7.3 million   was included in other non-current liabilities. 
  Chargeback and Sales Refund Allowance 
  The majority of the Company s customers purchase products by making an electronic payment with a credit card at the time of a transaction. The Company establishes a chargeback allowance and sales refund reserve allowance based on factors surrounding historical credit card chargeback trends, historical sales refund trends and other information. As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s combined allowance for chargebacks and sales refunds was   $0.7 million  , which was included in other liabilities.  
  Medical Self-insurance Costs  
  The Company is partially self-insured for claims relating to employee medical benefit programs. The medical self-insurance program is administered by a third party and contains stop-loss provisions on both an individual claim basis and in aggregate.  The Company records claims incurred as an expense each period, including an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate the liability for unreported claims and believes that the methodologies used to estimate insurance liabilities result in an accurate reflection of the liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet.

Contingent Consideration 
  The Company records a liability for contingent consideration at the date of a business combination and   reassesses the fair value of the liability each period until it is settled. Upon settlement of these liabilities, the portion of the contingent consideration payment that is attributable to the initial amount recorded as part of the business combination is classified as a cash flow from financing activities and the portion of the settlement that is attributable to subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration is classified as a cash flow from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.   
  Income Taxes 
  The Company s income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in projecting ordinary income in order to determine the Company s estimated effective tax rate. 
  The Company has assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets and determined that based on the available evidence, including a history of taxable income and estimates of future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Quarterly, the Company will continue to evaluate its ability to realize deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates in future periods, which may result in a change in the effective tax rate in a future period. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standard Updates 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance related to the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is intended to provide clarification and reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. The update is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Adoption of this guidance is required, prospectively, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to stock-based compensation. The new standard changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of certain related items in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective approach; amendments related to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively; and amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to leases. The new standard requires that the rights and obligations created by leases with a duration greater than 12 months be recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 and can be applied using a modified retrospective approach for all leases entered into before the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to income taxes. The new standard requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and will eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of this guidance by one year. As a result, this new guidance will be effective for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company may choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; if it does so, the Company is required to apply the standard beginning in the first interim period within the year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its financial statements. 
   
  (2) Fair Value Measurements 
  The following tables present the Company s fair value hierarchy for its assets and liabilities (in thousands): 

Money Market Accounts 
  Cash equivalents include money market accounts and are classified as a level 1 measurement based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.  
  Commercial Paper 
  The Company s short-term investments consist of commercial paper with original maturity dates of 90 days or less, which are available to support current operations and are classified as available-for-sale securities. Commercial paper is classified as a level 2 measurement based on quoted market prices for identical assets, which are subject to infrequent transactions.

Short-term investments are summarized as follows (in thousands):   

  Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration 
  The Company reassesses the fair value of contingent consideration to be settled in cash related to certain of the Company s acquisitions using the Black-Scholes model until the settlement amount of the cash flow is determinable. These contingencies are considered level 3 measurements. Significant assumptions used in measuring the fair value include probabilities of achieving certain revenue milestones based on the Company s expectations and a discount rate which is based on an unobservable input that is supported by little or no market activity.   
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the settlement amount of the contingent consideration related to the Company s acquisition of WebDAM was determined to be   $4.0 million   and was included in other liabilities.   No   changes in fair value were recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The contingent consideration of   $4.0 million   was paid in April 2016, and there was   no   remaining liability as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the settlement amount of the contingent consideration related to the PremiumBeat acquisition was determined to be   $10.0 million  , which will be paid during 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , the present value of the amount to be paid was   $9.7 million   and was included in other liabilities. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the contingent consideration was   $7.1 million  , and was included in other non-current liabilities.  
  Other Fair Value Measurements 
  Cash, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company s non-financial assets, which include property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur, or if an annual impairment test is required and the Company is required to evaluate the non-financial asset for impairment, a resulting asset impairment would require that non-financial assets be recorded at fair value. 
   
  (3) Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment is summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was   $3.9 million   and   $2.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10.4 million   and   $6.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Depreciation expense is included in cost of revenue and general and administrative expense based on the nature of the asset being depreciated.

  PremiumBeat 
  On January 22, 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Arbour Interactive, Inc., or PremiumBeat, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the PremiumBeat acquisition was   $9.7 million  , which represents the present value of the amount that will be paid, and is included in other liabilities. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the amount of   $2.6 million  , of which   $1.0 million   was recorded as a component of other (expense) income, net related to the passage of time and   $1.7 million   was recorded as a component of general and administrative expense related to a modification of the terms of the contingent consideration agreement. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of the acquired business have been included in the Company s results of operations from the acquisition date.

(6) Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company leases facilities under agreements accounted for as operating leases. Rental expense for operating leases was   $2.1 million   and   $1.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.0 million   and   $3.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Some leases have defined escalating rent provisions, which are expensed over the term of the related lease on a straight-line basis commencing with the date of possession. Any rent allowance or abatement is netted in this calculation. All leases require payment of real estate taxes and operating expense increases. 
  In 2016, the Company s lease for its office facility in New York City was amended to, among other things, provide for the lease of approximately   25,000   square feet of additional office space and extend the term of the lease. In connection with the underlying lease agreement, the Company entered into a letter of credit as a security deposit for the leased facilities, which was increased to   $2.6 million   in connection with the January 2016 amendment. The letter of credit was collateralized by   $2.6 million   of cash as of   September 30, 2016  , which is recorded as restricted cash and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. As amended, the lease is scheduled to expire in 2029 and aggregate future minimum payments under the amended lease are approximately   $83.8 million  . 
  Capital Expenditures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately   $0.2 million   of data servers and other equipment related to the expansion of its existing business and infrastructure. 
  Other Obligations  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had other obligations in the amount of approximately   $26.9 million  , which consisted primarily of minimum royalty guarantees and unconditional purchase obligations related to contracts for infrastructure and other business services. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s other obligations for the remainder of   2016   and for the years ending December 31,   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019   and   2020   were approximately   $1.2 million  ,   $9.7 million  ,   $8.1 million  ,   $4.0 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively.  
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company may become party to litigation in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or against the Company with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought against the Company s customers for whom the Company has a contractual indemnification obligation. The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to these matters and determines loss contingency assessments on a gross basis after assessing the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, the Company considers other relevant factors that could impact its ability to reasonably estimate a loss. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analyzing each matter. The Company reviews reserves, if any, at least quarterly and may change the amount of any such reserve in the future due to new developments or changes in strategy in handling these matters. Although the results of litigation and threats of litigation, investigations and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. The Company currently has no material active litigation matters and, as such, no material reserves related to litigation  . 
  Indemnification 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual agreements under which it agrees to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of the Company s intellectual property warranties for damages to the customer directly attributable to the Company s breach. The Company is not responsible for any damages, costs, or losses to the extent such damages, costs or losses arise as a result of any modifications made by the customer, or the context in which an image is used. The Company s license agreements generally cap indemnification obligations at amounts ranging from   $10,000   to   $250,000  , with certain exceptions for which the Company s indemnification obligations are uncapped. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had recorded   no   material liabilities related to indemnification obligations in accordance with the authoritative guidance for loss contingencies. Additionally, the Company believes that it has the appropriate insurance coverage in place to adequately cover such indemnification obligations, if necessary.

Under the program, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased approximately   1,280,000   shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at an average per-share cost of approximately   $34.44  .

(9) Other Expense, Net 
  The following table presents a summary of the Company s other income and expense activity included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

(10) Income Taxes 
  The Company s effective tax rates were   17.6%   and   43.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   29.9%   and   43.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The Company incurred discrete tax items, the net effect of which decreased the effective tax rate by   22.3%   and   1.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and decreased the effective rate by   10.0%   and increased the effective rate by   0.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company completed a study which determined the amount of the U.S. Research and Development tax credit for the years 2013 to 2015 to which it was entitled.  The 2015 tax credit was reflected in the 2015 federal tax return filed in the third quarter of 2016 and the 2013 and 2014 tax credits will be reflected in an amended federal tax return. 
  The Company has computed the provision for income taxes based on the estimated annual effective tax rate and the application of discrete items, if any, in the applicable period. The estimated annual effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due primarily to non-deductible expenses related to non-cash equity-based compensation. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years were   $1.0 million  .  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits recorded by the Company of   $1.0 million   were offset by a recognized tax benefit of   $1.0 million   related to the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions due to a lapse in the statute of limitations, resulting in a net amount recorded that was not material. During the three and nine months ended September 30 2015, unrecognized tax benefits recorded by the Company for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years were not material.  To the extent the remaining unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized, the Company s effective tax rate may be impacted in future periods. 
  The Company recognizes interest expense and tax penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company s accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material for the each of   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $2.3 million   of undistributed earnings attributable to its foreign subsidiaries. It is the Company s practice and intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in those operations. The Company has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences resulting from the earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. It is currently not practicable for the Company to calculate the associated unrecognized deferred tax liability. 
   
  (11) Net Income Per Share 
  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Any potential issuance of common shares, including those that are contingent and do not participate in dividends, is excluded from weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Income available to common stockholders is computed by deducting income allocated to participating securities, if any, including unvested shares for the restricted award holder since these unvested shares have participating rights.  
  Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding and all potential common shares, if they are dilutive.

(13) Subsequent Events 
  On October 20, 2016, the Company entered into a multi-part transaction (the  Transaction ) with an unrelated third-party contributor (the  Transaction Party ).  The Transaction included three primary components: (a) a revolving credit facility pursuant to which the Company would be obligated to lend up to   $4.6 million   (the  Facility ) to the Transaction Party.

Item 2.         Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our interim consolidated unaudited financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with information contained in our other filings, including the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on   February 24, 2016  . 
  In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. See the  Special Note on Forward Looking Statements  disclosure included above for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. See also the  Risk Factors  disclosure of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   for additional discussion of such risks. 
  Overview and Recent Developments 
  We are a leading global provider of high quality creative content including: (a) digital imagery, which consists of licensed photographs, illustrations, vectors and video clips that customers use in their visual communications, such as websites, digital and print marketing materials, corporate communications, books, publications and video content; and (b) commercial music, which consists of high-quality music tracks and sound effects and which is often used to complement the digital imagery. We also offer digital asset management services through WebDAM, our cloud-based digital asset management platform. This service provides tools for customers to better manage content and brand management assets.  
  Our global marketplace brings together users of creative content with content producers from around the world by providing a freely searchable collection of content that our customers can pay to license, download and incorporate into their work. More than   1.6 million   active, paying customers contributed to our revenue for the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , more than   160,000   approved contributors made their creative content available in our collection, which grew to more than   100 million   images for the first time in September of 2016, and has grown to include more than   5 million   video clips. This makes our collection of creative content one of the largest of its kind, and we delivered more than   125 million   paid downloads to our customers from that collection during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We believe that we delivered the highest volume of commercial image downloads in this period of any single brand in our industry. 
  In September 2016, we announced our acquisition of over 700,000 images from two prominent image collections: The Art Archive and The Kobal Collection. Both collections, previously held by The Picture Desk, are now available to Shutterstock customers globally. 
  In September 2016, we announced the release of a plugin for Adobe Photoshop  which provides creators around the world with instant access to our vast collection of high-quality images for license directly within the Adobe Creative Cloud  desktop application. 
  As a global marketplace, we generate revenue by licensing creative content to our customers and paying royalties to our contributors each time their content is delivered to a customer for use. Currently, the majority of our revenue and downloads come from our e-commerce platforms, which allow customers the flexibility of high-volume content subscriptions or a variety of other purchase options. In addition to sales through our e-commerce platform, we offer a number of other purchase options, primarily to enterprise customers, that can be customized to meet their specific needs.  As we continue to grow the business, we anticipate these other purchase options will grow as a share of our overall business. 
  Each time content is delivered to a customer for use, we record a royalty expense for the amount due to the associated contributor. Royalties are calculated using either a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of revenue as described on our websites, and are typically paid to contributors on a monthly basis, subject to withholding taxes and certain payout minimums. Royalties represent the largest component of our operating expenses and tend to increase proportionally with revenue. 
  Our cost of revenue is substantially similar as a percentage of revenue across our various purchase options. While contributors earn a fixed amount per download for some of our plans, we have set the per-download amount paid to our contributors for each of our purchase options so that contributors earn more per download from plans where we collect higher revenue per download. Under this cost structure, changes in revenue activity are the primary drivers of changes in our cost of revenue, and we expect that shifts in the relative popularity of our purchase options will not materially impact our proportional cost of revenue. 
  As a provider of digital asset management technology, we generate revenue by licensing the use of our WebDAM platform to customers on a contractual basis, typically with a one-year term.

An important driver of our growth is customer acquisition, which we achieve primarily through online marketing efforts, including paid search, organic search, online display advertising, email marketing, affiliate marketing, social media and strategic partnerships. We manage customer acquisition costs based on the expected blended customer lifetime value across our purchase options so that we are able to manage our marketing expenses to achieve certain desired growth targets. As a result, we do not believe that shifts in the mix between our purchase options will materially impact our operating margins.  
  Over the past several years, we have invested amounts in marketing that represent a significant percentage of revenue. Since we believe the market for creative content will continue to grow globally, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in customer acquisition through our various global channels to achieve revenue and market share growth. We believe that another important driver of growth is the quality of the user experience we provide on our websites, especially the efficiency with which our search interfaces and algorithms help customers find the content that they need, the degree to which we make use of the large quantity of data we collect about content and search patterns, and the degree to which we have been able to localize the overall experience for international audiences. In pursuit of these growth objectives, we have also invested aggressively in product development and we plan to broaden our investments in this area. Finally, the quality and quantity of content that we make available in our collection is another key driver of our growth. Approved and licensable high-quality content in the Shutterstock collection exceeded   100 million   images and   5 million   video clips as of   September 30, 2016  , making it one of the largest libraries of its kind. 
  Key Operating Metrics 
  In addition to key financial metrics, we regularly review a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies. We believe that these metrics can be useful for understanding the underlying trends in our business. The following table summarizes our key operating metrics, which are unaudited, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Paid Downloads    
  Measuring the number of paid downloads that our customers make in any given period is important because our revenue and contributor royalties are driven primarily by paid download activity. For customers that choose our On Demand purchase options, each incremental download results in incremental recognition of revenue. For customers that choose our subscription purchase options, we do not recognize revenue from each incremental download, but we believe that download activity is an important measure of the value that we deliver to subscription customers and the likelihood that the customer will renew. We define paid downloads as the number of downloads of our creative content by customers in a given period, excluding re-downloads of content that a customer has downloaded in the past (which do not generate incremental revenue or contributor royalty expense) and downloads of promotional images (which we make available at no cost as a means of acquiring new customers and attracting existing customers to return to our websites more frequently). 
  Revenue per Download    
  We define revenue per download as the amount of revenue recognized in a given period divided by the number of paid downloads in that period excluding the impact of revenue that is not derived from or associated with the download of content. This metric captures changes in our pricing, if any, as well as the mix of purchase options that our customers choose and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our pricing. Over the last three years, revenue from each of our purchase options has grown; however our fastest growing purchase options have been those that generate more revenue per download, most notably our On Demand purchase options. As our business grows and expands into other products and regions around the world, this metric may become less important as a tool for evaluating the business.

Images in Collection 
  We define images in our collection as the total number of photographs, vectors and illustrations available to customers for commercial license on shutterstock.com at any point in time. We exclude from this collection metric content that is not uploaded directly to our site but is available to our customers through an application program interface and certain content that may be licensed for editorial use only. We record this metric as of the end of a period. Offering a large selection of images allows us to attract and retain customers and, therefore, we believe that broadening our selection of high-quality images is an important driver of our revenue growth.  
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Item 2, contains a calculation of period-over-period revenue growth on a fixed-currency basis, which is a financial measure that has not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and should be considered in addition to our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
  Revenue growth on a fixed-currency basis (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues, utilizing fixed exchange rates for translating foreign currency revenues for both periods. 
  Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, as an operating measure to help evaluate our business and in making financial and operational decisions. Management believes that providing a measure of period-over-period revenue growth on a fixed-currency basis is useful to investors to provide them with disclosures of Shutterstock s revenue trends and overall business on the same basis as that which is used by management and because this metric eliminates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations that are not directly attributable to Shutterstock s underlying operating performance and are outside management s control. Additionally, management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the comparability for investors in assessing Shutterstock s financial reporting.  However, non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from traditional accounting conventions; accordingly, its use can make it difficult to compare our current results with our results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure or inclusion of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. We evaluate our significant estimates on an ongoing basis, including, but not limited to, estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, medical self-insurance accruals, chargeback and sales refund reserve, the fair value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, the fair value of contingent consideration, the provision for income taxes and the amount of certain non-income tax accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  We believe that the policies, assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, chargeback and sales refund reserve, stock-based compensation, self-insurance accruals, accounting for non-income and income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets and advertising costs have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 
  A description of our critical accounting policies that involve significant management judgments appears in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   that we filed with the SEC on   February 24, 2016  , or the   2015   Form 10-K, under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
   
  Key Components of Our Results of Operations  
  Revenue 
  The majority of our revenue, net of chargebacks and refunds, is generated through the licensing of creative content. The majority of our licensing revenue is generated by sales through our e-commerce platform. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents                                

We generate revenue through our e-commerce platform from the sale of subscriptions which provide customers the flexibility of high-volume content subscriptions or from a variety of other purchase options. Our subscriptions typically vary in length from one month to one year.  In addition to sales through our e-commerce platform, we offer a number of other purchase options, primarily to enterprise customers, that can be customized to meet our customers  specific needs.  
  We typically receive the full amount of e-commerce purchases at the time of sale; however, revenue is recognized ratably over the course of a subscription or as content is downloaded. Some of our larger custom and enterprise accounts are invoiced and pay us on credit terms. For certain of these accounts, we receive payment in installments over the course of an annual commitment. 
  We also generate revenue through WebDAM, which we acquired in March 2014. WebDAM licenses digital asset management software services to marketing and creative teams and enterprise organizations through its cloud-based software platform. Software licensing fees are recognized ratably as revenue over the course of the contractual term, which is typically one year. Any setup or implementation fees are recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual term or the estimated customer relationship period, which is currently three years. Fees for on-boarding and other professional services, which typically take place over a period of time less than one year and provide immediate benefit to customers upon completion, are recorded as revenue when services are substantially complete and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 
  Our deferred revenue consists of amounts paid by customers for which revenue recognition criteria have not been met. For content revenue, deferred revenue is recognized as revenue through the passage of time, when content is downloaded or when the credits or the right to download content expires, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. For WebDAM, deferred revenue is recognized as revenue through passage of time (subscriptions) or when a project is substantially complete (professional services) and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 
  Costs and Expenses 
  Cost of Revenue.   Cost of revenue consists of royalties paid to contributors, credit card processing fees, content review costs, customer service expenses, the infrastructure and hosting costs related to maintaining our e-commerce platform and cloud-based software platform and associated employee compensation, including non-cash equity-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, amortization of content and technology intangible assets, allocated facility costs and other supporting overhead costs. We expect that our cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as our revenue grows. 
  Sales and Marketing.       Sales and marketing expenses include third-party marketing, advertising, branding, public relations and sales expenses. Sales and marketing expenses also include associated employee compensation, including non-cash equity-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, and commissions as well as allocated facility and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in new customer acquisition. 
  Product Development.   Product development expenses consist of employee compensation, including non-cash equity-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, and expenses related to contractors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of our websites and products. Product development costs also include allocated facility and other supporting overhead costs. We expense product development expenses as incurred, except for costs that are capitalized for internal-use software development projects and subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the developed software. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing in 2016, we have experienced an increase in capitalized costs for internal-use software development related primarily to our efforts to launch new and innovative products. We expect product development expenses, of which a portion will be capitalized, to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in developing new products and internal tools and enhancing the functionality of our existing products and technology. 
  General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses include employee compensation, including non-cash equity-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for executive, finance, business development, accounting, legal, human resources, internal information technology, business intelligence and other administrative personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside legal, tax and accounting services, bad debt expense, insurance, facilities costs and other supporting overhead costs. We expect to incur incremental general and administrative expenses to support our global operational growth and enhancements to support our reporting and planning functions. 
  Other Expense, Net.   Other expense consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions and interest income and expense. We expect to incur incremental expense related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to our PremiumBeat acquisition as we reach the measurement date. Additionally, as we increase the volume of business transacted in foreign currencies as a result of international expansion and as currency rates fluctuate, we expect foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate.

     Table of Contents                                

Income Taxes  . We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory income tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
  As we continue to expand our operations outside of the United States, we have been and may continue to become subject to taxation in additional non-U.S. jurisdictions and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.

  Revenue 
  Revenue   increase  d by   $15.8 million  , or   15%  , to   $123.1 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue increased 17% compared to the third quarter of 2015.  We continue to grow our customer base and undertake initiatives focused on broadening our subscription product offerings, which has resulted in increased customer utilization and provides customers an effective price per content download that is more economical at higher volumes. We believe these offerings will lead to sustained customer engagement over longer periods. As a result of these initiatives, the   increase   in revenue during the quarter was primarily attributable to the   8%     increase   in the number of paid downloads, the acquisition of new customers and increased activity by our enterprise customers, which in turn has driven a   5.4%     increase   in revenue per download as compared to the prior year s quarter. In the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we delivered   41.2 million   and   38.1 million   paid downloads, respectively, and our average revenue per download during these periods was   $2.91   and   $2.76  , respectively.  
  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , as a percentage of total revenue, revenue from North America   increase  d slightly to   40%   from   39%   while revenue from Europe and the rest of the world remained relatively flat at   32%   and   28%  , respectively.  
  Costs and Expenses 
  Cost of Revenue  . Cost of revenue   increase  d by   $5.7 million  , or   13%  , to   $50.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Royalties   increase  d   $3.3 million  , or   10%  , due to increased download activity and changes in the mix of content downloads toward content types with higher revenue per download and higher corresponding royalties. We anticipate royalties will continue growing in absolute dollars as revenue grows, although royalties as a percentage of revenue may vary somewhat from period to period, primarily due to customer usage, product mix and to a lesser extent due to the contributors  achievement of royalty target thresholds. Costs associated with website hosting, content consulting and allocated depreciation and amortization expense   increase  d by   $0.9 million  , or   20%  , to   $5.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , driven in large part by increases in the depreciation of capitalized internal-use software.  Employee-related expenses   increase  d   $0.4 million  , or   11%  , driven by an increase in headcount in customer service, content and website operations to support increased customer volume and a more robust hosting infrastructure.  
  Sales and Marketing.   Sales and marketing expenses   increase  d by   $5.6 million  , or   20%  , to   $33.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The change was driven by a   $3.9 million     increase   in performance and brand advertising expenses, which represents a   29%     increase   over the prior year.  These advertising expenses have historically been the most significant component of sales and marketing expenses and can vary based on the timing of our strategic initiatives. Employee-related expenses, including travel and entertainment,   increase  d by   $1.0 million  , or   9%  , driven by  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents                                

an increase in sales and marketing headcount to support our expansion into new markets and increased sales commissions as a result of growing revenue from our direct sales. We anticipate that our global sales and marketing spend will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue growth through new products and geographies as well as growth from new customers. 
  Product Development  . Product development expenses   increase  d by   $0.8 million  , or   7%  , to   $11.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Employee-related and consulting-related expenses   increase  d by   $4.8 million  , or   53%  , driven by an increase in human capital requirements in product, engineering and quality assurance to support our increasing number of product development initiatives for our e-commerce platform, including ongoing efforts to improve our search capabilities. The   increase   in employee-related and consulting-related expenses was offset by an   increase   in capitalized labor costs of   $4.5 million   for internal-use software development projects. We anticipate product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future, of which a portion will continue to be capitalized, as we continue to invest in developing new products and internal tools and enhancing the functionality of our existing products and technology.  
  General and Administrative  . General and administrative expenses   increase  d by   $0.6 million  , or   4%  , to   $17.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The change was driven primarily by   increase  s in professional fees and software licenses net of capitalized amounts and allocated depreciation and amortization expense of   $1.5 million   primarily due to increased consulting-related services and costs related to improving our application and hardware infrastructure.  Expenses related to the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by approximately   $0.2 million   primarily based on the aging of accounts receivable, evaluations of specific customers during the period and an increase in the gross receivable balance due to higher sales to enterprise customers. These increases were partly offset by a   decrease   in non-cash equity-based compensation of   $1.2 million   or   29%   as compared to the prior year.  
  Other Income (Expense), Net  . Other income and expense primarily consists of the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to certain of our recent acquisitions and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  In the current period, foreign currency transaction gains were partly offset by changes in fair value of contingent consideration, neither of which was significant.  In the prior year s comparable period, other expense included foreign currency transaction losses in addition to charges related to contingent consideration. We expect foreign currency transaction gains and losses to continue to fluctuate as we continue to expand our international operations and increase the volume of business transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
  Income Taxes  . Income tax expense   decrease  d by   $1.2 million   to   $2.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   17.6%   and   43.9%  , respectively. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred a net discrete tax benefit primarily related to the U.S. Research and Development credit claimed for the years 2013-2015, which decreased our effective tax rate by   22.3%  , and during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   we incurred a net discrete tax benefit which decreased our effective tax rate by   1.6%  .  Excluding those discrete items, our effective tax rate would have been   39.9%   and   45.5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As part of our regular process, we will  evaluate the availability and amount of the U.S. Research and Development credit for periods beyond 2015.

  Revenue 
  Revenue   increase  d by   $55.0 million  , or   18%  , to   $364.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased 21% as compared to the same period in the prior year. We continue to grow our customer base and undertake initiatives focused on broadening our subscription product offerings, which has resulted in increased customer utilization and provides customers an effective price per content download that is more economical at higher volumes. We believe these offerings will lead to sustained customer engagement over longer periods.  As a result of these initiatives, the   increase   in revenue was primarily attributable to a   17%     increase   in the number of paid downloads, the acquisition of new customers and increased activity by our enterprise customers, with   no   change in revenue per download. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we delivered   125.8 million   and   107.4 million   paid downloads, respectively, and our average revenue per download during both of these periods was   $2.83  . 
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , revenue from North America   increase  d to   40%   from   39%   while revenue from Europe   decrease  d to   33%   from   34%   and revenue from the rest of the world remained relatively flat at approximately   27%   of total revenue. 
  Cost and Expenses 
  Cost of Revenue.     Cost of revenue   increase  d by   $23.9 million  , or   19%  , to   $150.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Royalties   increase  d   $15.8 million  , or   18%  , which was in line with the increase in revenue and paid downloads during the period. We anticipate royalties will continue growing in absolute dollars as revenue grows, although royalties as a percentage of revenue may vary somewhat from period to period primarily due to customer usage, product mix and to a lesser extent due to the contributors  achievement level of royalty target thresholds. Other costs associated with website hosting, content consulting and allocated depreciation and amortization expense   increase  d by   $3.2 million  , or   26%  , to   $15.4 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .   Employee-related expenses   increase  d by   $1.9 million  , or   16%  , driven by an increase in headcount in customer service, content and website operations to support increased customer volume and a more robust hosting infrastructure, and other costs of revenue increased approximately $2.0 million related to the costs related to strategic content partnerships. 
  Sales and Marketing.     Sales and marketing expenses   increase  d by   $11.7 million  , or   15%  , to   $91.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Expenses related to brand and performance advertising, the largest component of our sales and marketing expenses,   increase  d by   $6.2 million  , or   15%  , compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of increased spending on affiliate, search advertising and other new channels. We anticipate that our global advertising spend will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, as we continue to expand into additional markets. Employee-related expenses, including travel and entertainment,   increase  d by   $4.4 million  , or   14%  ,

driven by an increase in sales and marketing headcount to support our expansion into new markets and increased sales commissions as a result of growing revenue from our direct sales.  We anticipate that our global sales and marketing spend will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue growth through new products and geographies as well as growth from new customers. 
  Product Development.     Product development expenses   increase  d by   $3.1 million  , or   10%  , to   $34.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Employee-related and consulting-related expenses   increase  d by   $12.0 million  , or   45%  , driven by an increase in human capital requirements in product, engineering and quality assurance to support our increasing number of product development initiatives for our websites, including ongoing efforts to improve our search capabilities.  The   increase   in employee-related and consulting-related expenses was partially offset by an   increase   in capitalized costs of   $10.3 million   for internal-use software development projects. We anticipate product development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, of which a portion will continue to be capitalized, as we continue to invest in developing new products and internal tools and enhancing the functionality of our existing products and technology. 
  General and Administrative.     General and administrative expenses   increase  d by   $9.7 million  , or   22%  , to   $54.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . As compared to the prior year, professional fees, software licenses and allocated depreciation and amortization expense   increase  d by   $3.6 million   primarily due to increased consulting-related services and costs related to improving our system infrastructure.  Expenses related to the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by   $2.1 million   primarily based on the aging of accounts receivable, evaluations of specific customers during the period and an increase in the gross receivable balance due to higher sales to enterprise customers. Also included in general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     is a charge of $1.7 million related to a modification of the terms of the PremiumBeat contingent consideration arrangement. 
  Other Expense, Net.    Other expenses primarily include foreign currency gains and losses and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the passage of time.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , expenses related to contingent consideration were almost entirely offset by foreign currency transaction gains and interest income, as compared to   2015   where foreign currency transaction losses and significant expenses related to contingent consideration caused other expenses to be significantly higher.  The change in the impact of foreign currency drove a decrease in other expense of $2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior period.  We expect foreign currency transaction gains and losses to continue to fluctuate as we continue to expand our international operations and increase the volume of business transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
  Income Taxes.     Income tax expense   decrease  d by   $0.2 million   to   $9.7 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   29.9%   and   43.9%  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred a net discrete tax benefit primarily related to the U.S. Research and Development credit claimed for the years 2013-2015, which decreased our effective tax rate by   10.0%   and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred a net discrete tax expense which increased our effective tax rate by   0.6%  . Excluding these discrete items, the effective tax rate would have been   39.9%   and   43.3%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As part of our regular process, we will  evaluate the availability and amount of the U.S. Research and Development credit for periods beyond 2015. 
   
  Quarterly Trends  
  Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the effects of some seasonal trends in customer behavior. For example, we expect certain customers  usage may decrease during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the year-end holiday vacation season and may increase in the first quarter of each calendar year as many customers return to work. While we believe seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our trajectory of rapid growth may have overshadowed these effects to date. Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from repeat customers who have purchased subscription plans, our revenues tend to be smoother and less volatile than if we had no subscription-based customers. 
  In addition, expenditures on digital content by customers tend to be discretionary in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, the economic prospects of specific industries, budgeting constraints, buying patterns and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside our control. As a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indicators of our future operating performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $238.0 million  , which consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and checking account balances. Additionally, we held short-term investments in the amount of   $52.4 million  , all of which mature in 90 days or less. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows generated from operations.  
   Historically, our principal uses of cash have been funding our operations, capital expenditures, content acquisition, business combinations that enhance our strategic position and share purchases under our share repurchase program. We plan to finance our operations and capital expenses largely through cash generated by our operations. Since our results of operations are sensitive to the level of competition we face, increased competition could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In October 2015, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock. We expect to fund repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and future financing transactions, if appropriate. Accordingly, our share repurchase program is subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under this program, management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased approximately   1,739,000   shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program at an average per-share cost of   $34.33  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $40.3 million   remaining for share repurchases under this program.  
  Share-Based Compensation 
  Effective October 1, 2016, we implemented a practice of net share settlement upon the vesting of RSUs to cover any required withholding taxes by retaining a number of shares with a value equal to the amount of the tax and remitting cash to the appropriate taxing authorities, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon vesting to fund the required withholding taxes ( sell-to-cover ). The net share settlement approach will increase our cash outflows compared to the cash outflows under the sell-to-cover approach.  In addition, as compared to the sell-to-cover approach, net share settlement will result in fewer shares being issued into the market as employees  RSUs vest, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of our share-based compensation programs on shareholders. 
  Content Distribution and Capital Arrangement 
  On October 20, 2016, we entered into a multi-part transaction (the  Transaction ) with an unrelated third-party contributor (the  Transaction Party ).  The Transaction included three primary components: (a) a revolving credit facility pursuant to which we would be obligated to lend up to $4.6 million (the  Facility ) to the Transaction Party.  The Facility has a term of five years and requires that the Transaction Party make quarterly payments of principal to us beginning on the fourth anniversary of the Facility.  The Facility bears interest at 10.0%, with all interest payments deferred until maturity, and the entire unpaid balance of principal and accrued interest due upon maturity; (b) we will be the exclusive distributor of the Transaction Party s content in certain markets subject to certain limitations; and (c) we, at our option, may acquire the Transaction Party at any time after the third anniversary of the Facility or match any third-party acquisition offer at any time until the fifth anniversary of the Facility.  Borrowings under the Facility may be made upon request of the Transaction Party at any time, and satisfaction of such requests will increase our cash outflows. 
  Sources and Uses of Funds 
  We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Consistent with previous periods, we expect that future capital expenditures will primarily relate to acquiring additional servers and network connectivity hardware and software, enhancements to the functionality of our current platform, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to office expansion and relocation, digital content and general corporate infrastructure. We anticipate capital additions, inclusive of digital content acquisition and capitalized labor, of approximately $7.0 million during the remainder of 2016. In April 2016, we paid the full amount of the contingent purchase price for WebDAM of approximately $4.0 million, and expect to pay $10.0 million related to the contingent purchase price for PremiumBeat during the first half of 2017. See Note 6 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding existing capital commitments as of   September 30, 2016  .

Cash Flows    
  Operating Activities 
  Our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers. The majority of our revenue is generated from credit card transactions and is typically settled within one to five business days. Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are for settlement of accounts payable to contributors and vendors and employee-related expenditures. 
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $76.7 million  , including net income of   $22.8 million  , non-cash equity-based compensation of   $21.1 million  , depreciation and amortization of   $14.2 million   and the change in fair value of contingent consideration of   $2.6 million  . Cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities included an   increase   in deferred revenue of   $19.4 million  , primarily related to the change in the volume of sales activity for which revenue has not been recognized, and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred revenue related to our WebDAM services.  These amounts were offset by the portion of the contingent consideration payment related to the WebDAM acquisition that was classified as an operating cash flow of approximately   $1.6 million  . 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $38.9 million  , consisting primarily of capital expenditures of   $26.7 million   to purchase software and equipment related to our data centers, capitalization of leasehold improvements and website development costs and   $6.2 million   paid to acquire the rights to distribute certain digital content in perpetuity.  Included in these amounts is approximately   $3.9 million   related to our acquisition of the intellectual property and content assets of The Picture Desk Limited during the third quarter of 2016. In addition, we increased our position in short-term investments by   $5.2 million  , net of sales.  
  Financing Activities 
  Cash used in financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $38.8 million  , consisting primarily of   $44.9 million   paid for share repurchases during the period and   $2.4 million   which was paid to the former owners of WebDAM in settlement of the contingent purchase price liability established at the acquisition date.  These amounts were offset by proceeds of approximately   $9.0 million   from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan.  
   
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  
  We lease office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through   2029  . We also have several co-location agreements with third-party hosting facilities that expire through   2017  . We do not have any material capital lease obligations, and our property, equipment and software have been purchased primarily with cash. We anticipate expanding our office and co-location facilities as our revenue and customer base continue to grow and diversify. 
  On March 21, 2013, we entered into an operating lease agreement to lease our headquarters in New York City. The aggregate future minimum lease payments under the lease, as amended, are approximately   $83.8 million  . We are also party to a letter of credit as a security deposit for this leased facility, which was increased to   $2.6 million   in January 2016 in connection with an amendment of the lease. As of   September 30, 2016  , the letter of credit is collateralized by   $2.6 million   of cash, which is reported as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , aggregate future minimum lease payments under other operating leases are approximately   $6.8 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our guaranteed royalty payments and unconditional purchase obligations for the remainder of   2016   and for the fiscal years ending December 31,   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019   and   2020   were approximately   $1.2 million  ,   $9.7 million  ,   $8.1 million  ,   $4.0 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources that is material to investors. 
   
  Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
  We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including risks related to interest rate fluctuation, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation and inflation.

Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk 
  Our investments include cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments which consist of commercial paper. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. Because our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments have a maximum term of ninety days, our portfolio s fair value is not particularly sensitive to interest rate changes. We do not enter into investments for speculative purposes. We determined that the nominal difference in basis points for investing our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in longer-term investments did not warrant a change in our investment strategy. In future periods, we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives. 
  We did not have any borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk    
  Revenue derived from customers residing outside of the U.S. as a percentage of total revenue was approximately   66%   for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and approximately   65%   and   66%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our sales to international customers are denominated in multiple currencies, including but not limited to the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. Revenue denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total revenue was approximately   32%   and   31%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   32%   and   31%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We have foreign currency exchange risks related to non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues. All amounts earned by and paid to our foreign contributors are denominated in the U.S. dollar and therefore do not create foreign currency exchange risk. However, changes in exchange rates will affect our revenue and certain operating expenses to the extent that our revenue is generated and expenses are incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on our foreign currency denominated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that a 10% change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currency denominated revenues would result in an approximately 3% impact on our revenue. 
  Although the majority of our revenue and expenses are incurred in the U.S. dollar, we have experienced fluctuations in our net income as a result of the volume of our business transacted in foreign currency and the changes in strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, specifically the euro and British pound. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, foreign currency gains offset foreign currency losses and during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the impact of foreign currency transactions was a loss of   $0.4 million  . We do not currently enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in order to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the future. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations. 
  We have established foreign subsidiaries in various countries around the world and as a result the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are reported in the applicable foreign currencies (functional currencies). For those entities where the functional currency is the local currency, adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Inflation Risk 
  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Item 4.         Controls and Procedures.  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents                                

principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is in the process of implementing our internal control structure over Rex Features and PremiumBeat, both of which we acquired in January 2015. Except for the changes associated with this implementation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.        Legal Proceedings.  
  Although we are not currently a party to any material active litigation, from time to time, third parties assert claims against us regarding intellectual property rights, privacy issues and other matters arising during the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation or the disposition of any claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure, if any, that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of all existing matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to periodic threats of lawsuits, investigations and claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  
  We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-K and Part II,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to the risk factors described in our   2015   Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016.

  SHUTTERSTOCK, INC. 
    
  AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 OMNIBUS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
    
  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
  Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the  Award Agreement ) shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Shutterstock, Inc. Amended and Restated 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the    Plan   ). 
    
  I.                 NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT 
    
  Participant Name: 
    
  Address: 
    
  You have been granted an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, as follows: 
    
  Grant Number 
    
  Date of Grant 
    
  Vesting Commencement Date 
    
  Number of Restricted Stock Units 
    
  Vesting Schedule 
    
  In the event Participant ceases to be a Service Provider (or gives or is given notice of such termination) for any or no reason before Participant vests in the Restricted Stock Unit, the Restricted Stock Unit and Participant s right to acquire any Shares hereunder, or the cash equivalent of all or some portion of such Shares, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, will immediately terminate. 
    
  By Participant s acknowledgment on the UBS website and the signature of the representative of Shutterstock, Inc. (the    Company   ) below, Participant and the Company agree that this Award of Restricted Stock Units is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, including the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant (and any country-specific addendum thereto), attached hereto as   Exhibit A  , all of which are made a part of this document.  Participant has reviewed the Plan and this Award Agreement in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Award Agreement and fully understands all provisions of the Plan and Award Agreement.  Participant hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Administrator upon any questions relating to the Plan and Award Agreement.  Participant further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the Participant s residence address. 

SHUTTERSTOCK, INC. 

By: 

EXHIBIT A 
    
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT 
    
  1.                 Grant  .  The Company hereby grants to the individual named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the    Participant   ) under the Plan an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 
    
  2.                 Company s Obligation to Pay  .  Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share, or the cash equivalent thereof, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, on the date it vests.  Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3, Participant will have no right to settlement of any such Restricted Stock Units.  Prior to actual settlement of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.  Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 or 4 will be settled in whole Shares, or the cash equivalent of some or all of such Shares, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, subject to Participant satisfying any applicable tax withholding or other obligations as set forth in Section 7.  Subject to the provisions of Section 4, such vested Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares and/or cash, as determined by the Administrator, as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case no later than two and one-half (2 ) months from the end of the Company s tax year that includes the vesting date. 
    
  3.                 Vesting Schedule  .  Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant.  Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs.  Service Provider status will end on the day that notice of termination is provided (whether by the Company or Parent or Subsidiary for any reason or by Participant upon resignation) and will not be extended by any notice period that may be required contractually or under applicable local law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator (or any delegate) shall have the sole discretion to determine when Participant is no longer providing active service for purposes of Service Provider status and participation in the Plan. 
    
  4.                 Administrator Discretion  .  The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan.  If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. 
    
  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with Participant s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a  separation from service  within  

the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death  ,   and if (x) Participant is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following Participant s termination as a Service Provider, then the settlement of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not occur until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Participant s termination as a Service Provider, unless the Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be settled in Shares and/or cash as soon as practicable following his or her death.  It is the intent of this Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares and/or cash issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply.  For purposes of this Award Agreement,  Section 409A  means Section 409A of the Code, and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time. 
    
  5.                 Forfeiture upon Termination of Status as a Service Provider  .  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, the balance of the Restricted Stock Units that have not vested as of the time notice is provided (whether by Participant or the Company or Parent or Subsidiary) of Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any or no reason and Participant s right to acquire any Shares and/or cash hereunder will immediately terminate. 
    
  6.                 Death of Participant  .  Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to Participant s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Participant, the administrator or executor of Participant s estate.  Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.

If the Company is unable to retain sufficient Shares to satisfy such Tax-Related Items, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company or an affiliate of the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any national, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld for Tax-Related Items relating to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units.

Related Items hereunder at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4, Participant will permanently forfeit such Restricted Stock Units and any right to receive Shares and/or cash thereunder and the Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. 
    
  8.                 Rights as Stockholder  .  Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until, and only to the extent that, certificates representing Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant.  After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.

  2.                                          Company s Obligation to Pay  .  Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share, or the cash equivalent thereof, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, on the date it vests.  Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3, Participant will have no right to settlement of any such Restricted Stock Units.  Prior to actual settlement of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.  Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 or 4 will be settled in whole Shares, or the cash equivalent of some or all of such Shares, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, subject to Participant satisfying any applicable tax withholding or other obligations as set forth in Section 7.

Service Provider status will end on the day that notice of termination is provided (whether by the Company or Parent or Subsidiary for any reason or by Participant upon resignation) and will not be extended by any notice period that may be required contractually or under applicable local law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator (or any delegate) shall have the sole discretion to determine when Participant is no longer providing active service for purposes of Service Provider status and participation in the Plan.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DEFERRED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT 
    
  1.                                          Grant  .  The Company hereby grants to the individual named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Award Agreement (the    Participant   ) under the Plan an Award of Restricted Stock Units, subject to all of the terms and conditions in this Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan will prevail. 
    
  2.                                          Company s Obligation to Pay  . 
    
  (a)                                     Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share     or the cash equivalent thereof, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, following the date on which it vests.  Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3, Participant will have no right to settlement of any such Restricted Stock Units.  Prior to actual settlement of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.  Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with Sections 3 or 4 will be settled in whole Shares, or the cash equivalent of some or all of such Shares, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, subject to Participant satisfying any applicable tax withholding or other obligations as set forth in Section 7.  Subject to the provisions of Section 4, such vested Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares and/or cash, as determined by the Administrator, as soon as practicable (but not more than ninety (90) days) following the earlier of (i) the Participant s separation from service (in accordance with Section 2(b)) or (ii) certain change in control transactions described in Section 2(c). 
    
  (b)                                     In the event that the Participant incurs a separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) for any reason, including, but not limited to, death, Disability, or retirement, the vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled as soon as practicable (but not more than 90 days) following the date of such separation from service, except as provided by Section 4, and in each case subject to Section 7. 
    
  (c)                                      In the event of a transaction or event that constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as determined in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), the vested Restricted Stock Units will be settled as soon as practicable (but not more than 90 days) following the date of such transaction or event (subject to Section 7). 
    
  3.                                          Vesting Schedule  .  Except as provided in Section 4, and subject to Section 5, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant.  Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in Participant in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs.  Service Provider status will end on the day that notice of termination is provided (whether by the Company or Parent or Subsidiary for any reason or by Participant upon resignation) and will not be extended by any notice period that may be required contractually or under applicable local law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator (or any delegate) shall have the sole discretion to determine when Participant is no longer providing active service for purposes of Service Provider status and participation in the Plan. 
    
  4.                                          Administrator Discretion  .  The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting, but not the settlement date, of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan.  If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of the Participant s termination as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death  ,   and if (x) Participant is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following Participant s termination as a Service Provider, then the settlement of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not occur until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Participant s termination as a Service Provider, unless the Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be settled in Shares and/or cash as soon as practicable following his or her death.  It is the intent of this Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares and/or cash issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply.  For purposes of this Award Agreement,  Section 409A  means Section 409A of the Code, and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time. 
    
  5.                                          Forfeiture upon Termination of Status as a Service Provider  .  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, the balance of the Restricted Stock Units that have not vested as of the time notice is provided (whether by Participant or the Company or Parent or Subsidiary) of Participant s termination as a Service Provider for any or no reason and Participant s right to acquire any Shares and/or cash hereunder will immediately terminate. 
    
  6.                                          Death of Participant  .  Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement will, if Participant is then deceased, be made to Participant s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Participant, the administrator or executor of Participant s estate.  Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer. 
    
  7.                                          Withholding of Taxes  .  Regardless of any action the Company or Participant s employer (the    Employer   ) takes with respect to any or all applicable national, local, or other tax or social contribution, withholding, required deductions, or other payments, if any, that arise upon the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the holding or subsequent sale of Shares, and the receipt of dividends, if any (   Tax-Related Items   ), Participant acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by Participant is and remains Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  Participant further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including grant, vesting or settlement, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired under the Plan, and the receipt of dividends, if any; and (b) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the Restricted Stock Units or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items, or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no certificate representing the Shares will be issued and no cash will be paid to Participant, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. 
    
  On each vesting date (or other date or time at which the Company is required to withhold Tax-Related Items), the Company will retain from the Shares otherwise issuable on such date a number of Shares having a fair market value (as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) equal to the Company s minimum statutory withholding obligation with respect to Tax-Related Items.  If the Company is unable to retain sufficient Shares to satisfy such Tax-Related Items, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company or an affiliate of the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Participant any national, state,  

local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld for Tax-Related Items relating to the vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required Tax-Related Items hereunder, Participant will permanently forfeit such Restricted Stock Units and any right to receive Shares and/or cash thereunder and the Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. 
    
  8.                                          Rights as Stockholder  .  Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until, and only to the extent that, certificates representing Shares will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant.  After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 
    
  9.                                          No Guarantee of Continued Service or Grants  .  PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OR ACQUIRING SHARES OR CASH HEREUNDER.  PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AWARD AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. 
    
  Participant also acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; (b) the grant of Restricted Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units even if Restricted Stock Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (c) all decisions with respect to future awards of Restricted Stock Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) Participant s participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares and/or cash subject to the Restricted Stock Units are extraordinary items that do not constitute regular compensation for services rendered to the Company or the Employer, and that are outside the scope of Participant s employment contract, if any; (f) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares and/or cash subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; (g) the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares and/or cash subject to the Restricted Stock Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, or end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company or the Employer; and (h) in accepting this Award of Restricted Stock Units, Participant will be bound by any clawback policy that the Company may adopt in the future. 
    
  10.                                   Address for Notices  .

Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this grant, or any right or  

privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this grant and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void. 
    
  12.                                   Binding Agreement  .

  13.                                   Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock  .  If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of any Shares issuable hereunder upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority is necessary or desirable as a condition to the issuance of Shares to Participant (or his or her estate), such issuance will not occur unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval will have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.  Where the Company determines that the delivery of the payment of any Shares will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws, the Company will defer delivery until the earliest date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares will no longer cause such violation.  The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the requirements of any such state or federal law or securities exchange and to obtain any such consent or approval of any such governmental authority.  The Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units at any time if the issuance of Shares violates or is not in compliance with any laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any state or country. 
    
  Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on Participant s participation in the Plan, on the Restricted Stock Units and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.  Furthermore, Participant understands that the laws of the country in which he or she is resident at the time of grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the holding or disposition of Shares (including any rules or regulations governing securities, foreign exchange, tax, labor or other matters) may restrict or prevent the issuance of Shares or may subject Participant to additional procedural or regulatory requirements he or she is solely responsible for and will have to independently fulfill in relation to the Restricted Stock Units or the Shares.  Notwithstanding any provision herein, the Restricted Stock Units and any Shares and/or cash shall be subject to any special terms and conditions or disclosures as set forth in any addendum for Participant s country (the  Country-Specific Addendum,  which forms part this Award Agreement). 
    
  14.                                   Plan Governs  .  This Award Agreement is subject to all terms and provisions of the Plan.

Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Award Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Plan.

Modifications to this Award Agreement may be made in the manner, and to the extent, set forth in the Plan. 
    
  20.                                   Data Privacy  .    Participant hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of Participant s personal data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company and its affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing Participant s participation in the Plan.  Participant understands that the Company and its affiliates may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company or any affiliate, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant s favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ( Personal Data ).

Participant authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Personal Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing Participant s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Personal Data as may be required to a broker or other third party with whom Participant may elect to deposit any Shares received.  Participant understands that Personal Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant s participation in the Plan.  Participant understands that he or she may, at any time, view Personal Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Personal Data, require any necessary amendments to Personal Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, without cost, by contacting in writing Participant s local human resources representative.  Participant understands that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect Participant s ability to participate in the Plan or to realize benefits from the Plan.  For more information on the consequences of Participant s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative.

Participant understands and agrees that the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and may decrease.  Participant also understands that neither the Company, nor any affiliate is responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between local currency and the United States Dollar or the selection by the Company or any affiliate in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate that may affect the value of the Restricted Stock Units or Shares received (or the calculation of income or Tax-Related Items thereunder).  Participant understands and agrees that any cross-border remittance made to transfer proceeds received upon the sale of Shares must be  

made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require the Participant to provide such entity with certain information regarding the transaction. 
    
  22.                                   Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan  .  By accepting this Award, Participant expressly warrants that he or she has received an Award of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan, and has received, read and understood a description of the Plan.  Participant understands that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time. 
    
  23.                                   Unsecured Creditor  .  This grant of Restricted Stock Units represents an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay on behalf of the Company, which means that Participant is a general, unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units and the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the claims of the Company s creditors.  If the Company s assets are insufficient to pay all of its creditors, the Participant may not receive all or part of the Restricted Stock Units. 
    
  24.                                   Governing Law  .  This Award Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
