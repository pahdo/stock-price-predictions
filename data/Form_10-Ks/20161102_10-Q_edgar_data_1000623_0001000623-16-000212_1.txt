Note 1. General 
    
  Nature of Business 
    
  Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc., or SWM or the Company, headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia in the United States of America, is a multinational diversified producer of highly engineered solutions and advanced materials for a variety of industries.  The Company maintains two operating product line segments: Engineered Papers and Advanced Materials and Structures. 
    
  Historically, through its Engineered Papers, or EP, segment, the Company has primarily served the tobacco industry via the manufacture and sale of paper and reconstituted tobacco products, which remains a key focus.  The primary products sold to the tobacco industry include cigarette, plug wrap and base tipping papers, or Cigarette Papers, which are used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco leaf, or RTL, which is used as a blend with virgin tobacco in cigarettes, and reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for cigars. These products are sold directly to tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.  The EP segment is a manufacturer of lightweight specialty papers used in manufacturing banded papers used in the production of lower ignition propensity, or LIP, cigarettes and also produces premium specialized papers for other applications, including low volume specialized commercial and industrial commodity paper grades produced, among other reasons, to maximize machine utilization. 
    
  Through its Advanced Materials   Structures, or AMS, segment, the Company is a specialty producer of resin-based plastic netting through an extrusion process, as well as certain meltblown products, machined plastic core tubes, urethane films, and resin-based rolled products for use in other end segments, such as filtration, surface protection, medical and other industrials.  As discussed more fully in Note 3. Business Acquisitions, in October 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Argotec Intermediate Holdings LLC, or Argotec, a manufacturer of urethane films for use in high-performance niche applications such as surface and automotive paint protection, glass lamination, medical woundcare and other industrial uses. This acquisition has been incorporated into the AMS segment. 
    
  The Company has operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Brazil, China and Poland, conducts business in over   90   countries, and operates   18   production locations worldwide.  The Company also has a   50%   equity interest in   two   joint ventures in China: China Tobacco Mauduit (Jiangmen) Paper Industry Ltd., or CTM, which produces cigarette and porous plug wrap papers, and China Tobacco Schweitzer (Yunnan) Reconstituted Tobacco Co. Ltd., or CTS, which produces RTL. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods including the results of a business reclassified as a discontinued operation which is more fully described in Note   4  . Discontinued Operations. 
    
  The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes thereto included herein should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Company s share of the net income of its   50%  -owned joint ventures in China

is included in the condensed consolidated statements of income as income (loss) from equity affiliates. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, inventory valuation, useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, fair values, sales returns and rebates, receivables valuation, pension, postretirement and other benefits, restructuring and impairment, taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606). This guidance specifies how and when an entity will recognize revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires entities to disclose information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods).  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."  This update requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using the Last-in, First-out or the retail inventory method.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements and does not expect that its adoption will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification." The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted. Companies must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  This standard makes several modifications to existing guidance related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  ASU 2016-11, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates

2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting," and ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASC 2014-09. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncements on the consolidated financial statements. 

Note   2  . Other Comprehensive Income 
    
  Comprehensive income includes net income, as well as items charged and credited directly to stockholders' equity, which are excluded from net income. The Company has presented comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Reclassification adjustments of derivative instruments are presented in Net Sales, Other income, net, or Interest Expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. See Note   11  . Derivatives for additional information.  Amortization of accumulated pension and other post-employment benefit, or OPEB, liabilities are included in the computation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs, which are more fully discussed in Note   13  . Postretirement and Other Benefits.

Note 3. Business Acquisitions 
    
  On October 28, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Argotec Intermediate Holdings, LLC, or Argotec, through an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement entered into on September 17, 2015, by and among Argotec, the Company, SWM-Argotec, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Argotec Intermediate Holdings Two LLC, Argotec LLC , Argotec Holdings LLC, and certain equity holders of Argotec Holdings LLC.  The acquisition of Argotec expanded and diversified SWM's global presence in advanced materials and has been incorporated into the Company's AMS segment. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are provisional because final appraisals have not yet been completed.  As consideration, the Company paid   $282.7 million   in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily for the adjusted value of working capital at the acquisition date.  The acquisition was financed using borrowings under the Company's Amended Credit Agreement (defined below).  See Note 10. Debt, for additional information. 
    
  The consideration paid for Argotec and the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the October 28, 2015 acquisition date were as follows ($ in millions): 

The Company used the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate and used valuation inputs in these models and analyses that were based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. For certain items, the carrying amount was determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to SWM management. The fair value of receivables acquired from Argotec on October 28, 2015 was   $16.1 million  , with gross contractual amounts receivable of   $16.8 million  . Acquired inventories and property, plant and equipment were recorded at their fair values. Acquired intangible assets are primarily trade names, customer relationships and non-competition agreements.   
    
  Properties acquired included a manufacturing and related facility, land and leased sites that include leasehold improvements, and machinery and equipment for use in manufacturing operations. Management valued properties

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data which included consideration of obsolescence.    One   of the properties acquired, the Argotec-Stevens facility in Easthampton, Massachusetts with an estimated fair value of   $1.0 million  , was held for sale as of the acquisition date and during the fourth quarter of 2015 came under contract for sale to a third party.  The sale of this property was completed in April 2016 and   no   gain or loss was recognized on the disposition. 
    
  Intangible assets acquired included trade names that are both business-to-business and business-to-consumer. In addition to these intangible assets, the Company acquired a number of customer relationships in the aeronautical, transportation, graphics, medical and industrial markets. Management valued intangible assets using the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, both forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The following table shows the fair values assigned to intangible assets ($ in millions): 

In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill, which represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the preliminary fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. The goodwill is attributed primarily to Argotec's revenue growth from combining the SWM and Argotec businesses and workforces as well as the benefits of access to different markets and customers. Goodwill from the Argotec acquisition was assigned to the AMS reportable segment. The goodwill from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  The goodwill was determined on the basis of the preliminary fair values of the assets and liabilities identified as part of the transaction.  
    
  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of direct and indirect acquisition-related costs.  In 2015, the Company recognized   $1.8 million   of direct and indirect acquisition-related costs and incurred   $7.4 million   in acquisition-related financing costs. Direct and indirect acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in the General expense line item in the consolidated statements of income. Financing costs related to expanding the Amended Credit Agreement have been capitalized and will be amortized in Interest expense over the life of the Amended Credit Agreement.  
    
  The amounts of the unaudited pro forma Net Sales and Income from Continuing Operations of the combined entity had the acquisition date been January 1, 2015 are as follows ($ in millions): 

Note   4  . Discontinued Operations 
    
  Beginning in 2013, the Company's former paper mill in San Pedro, Philippines has been reported as a discontinued operation. This mill was previously presented as a component of the EP segment.  The physical assets at the Philippines paper mill were sold during the fourth quarter of 2013. For all periods presented, results of this mill have been removed from each individual line within the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of discontinued operations.

Note   5  . Net Income Per Share 
    
  The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share. The Company has granted restricted stock that contains non-forfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares. Since these unvested shares are considered participating securities under the two-class method, the Company allocates earnings per share to common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings.  
    
  Diluted net income per common share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares during the respective periods are those related to dilutive stock-based compensation, including long-term stock-based incentive compensation and directors  accumulated deferred stock compensation which may be received by the directors in the form of stock or cash. A reconciliation of the average number of common and potential common shares outstanding used in the calculations of basic and diluted net income per share follows ($ in millions, shares in thousands): 

Note 6. Inventories 
    
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (using the First-In, First-Out and weighted average methods) or market. The Company's costs included in inventory primarily include pulp, resins, chemicals, direct labor, utilities, maintenance, depreciation, finishing supplies and an allocation of certain overhead costs. Machine start-up costs or abnormal machine shut downs are expensed in the period incurred and are not reflected in inventory. The definition of market value, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews inventories at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write-offs for excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory. The Company estimates write-offs for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. These reviews require the Company to assess customer and market demand. The following schedule details inventories by major class ($ in millions):

Note   7  . Goodwill 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were as follows ($ in millions): 

Note 8. Intangible Assets 
    
  The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for intangible assets consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

*  Accumulated amortization also includes adjustments for foreign currency translation. 
    
  Amortization expense of intangible assets was   $3.0 million   and   $1.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $9.2 million   and   $3.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Finite-lived intangibles in the AMS segment are expensed using the straight-line amortization method. The estimated average aggregate amortization expense is   $11.6 million   in each of the next   five   years.  

Note   9  . Restructuring and Impairment Activities 
    
  The Company incurred restructuring and impairment expenses of   $1.3 million   in both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and   $4.0 million   and   $10.5 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  In the EP segment, restructuring and impairment expenses were   $1.3 million   and   $1.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $3.1 million   and   $10.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Restructuring and impairment expenses for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $2.6 million   in severance accruals for employees at our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., France and Brazil and   $0.5 million   of impairment expense recognized on equipment at our Poland manufacturing facility.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, restructuring and impairment expenses were composed of   $7.0 million   in  
  
    14 

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

severance accruals for employees at our Quimperl  and Spay, France facilities as well as   $3.5 million   in loss recognized to adjust the recorded value of equipment at our Philippines RTL location to its estimated fair value as discussed in more detail below. 
    
  The AMS segment incurred no restructuring and impairment expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and incurred   $0.6 million   and reversed   $0.2 million    for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Restructuring and impairment expenses for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of severance accruals for employees at our U.S. manufacturing operations.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, restructuring and impairment expenses were reversed related to previously accrued severance costs in our AMS segment resulting from one of our business acquisitions in December 2014. 
    
  Additionally, the Company incurred   $0.0 million   and reversed   $0.1 million   in restructuring expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and incurred   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   in restructuring expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in each case related to accruals for severance expenses within supporting overhead departments which were not allocated to a specific segment.  
    
  Restructuring liabilities were classified within Accrued Expenses in each of the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  Changes in the restructuring liabilities, substantially all of which are employee-related, during the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows ($ in millions): 

Long-lived assets to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; the assets are available for immediate sale in present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; the sale of the assets is probable, and transfer of the assets is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the assets beyond one year; the assets are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 
    
  A long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until the date of sale. The fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any reduction in fair value is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset. Upon being classified as held for sale ,depreciation is ceased.  Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are continued to be depreciated. Upon determining that a long-lived asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, are reported in the line item Assets Held for Sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  In early 2015, the Company made the decision to dispose of the Company's mothballed RTL facility and related equipment in the Philippines.  These assets are included in the EP segment.  During 2015, the Company reclassified the balance of the equipment, along with the land and building associated with the property, at this location from Property, Plant and Equipment, net, to Assets Held for Sale on the consolidated balance sheets.  The reclassifications were made for all assets that are expected to be sold within one year of the balance sheet date and, as of September 30,

Note   10  . Debt 
    
  The components of total debt are summarized in the following table ($ in millions): 

Credit Agreement 
    
  On October 28, 2015, the Company, together with two of its Luxembourg-based wholly-owned holding subsidiaries, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amended Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of   $1 billion  , consisting of a   $650 million   revolving credit facility, or Revolving Credit Facility, available to the Company; a   $100 million   Term Loan A-1, or Term Loan A-1, made to the Company; and a   $250 million   Term Loan A-2, or Term Loan A-2 and, together with Term Loan A-1, the Term Loans, made to the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on   October 28, 2020  . The Term Loan A-1 amortizes at the rate of   5.0%   for the first   two   years, at the rate of   10.0%   for the final   three   years and matures on   October 28, 2020  . The Term Loan A-2 amortizes at the rate of   1.0%   per year and matures on   October 28, 2022  . The Term Loans are generally subject to mandatory repayment out of the net cash proceeds of asset sales which are not reinvested in operating assets. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries while the obligations of the Luxembourg-based holding subsidiaries are secured by a pledge of certain of the equity interests held in their operating subsidiaries.  In December 2015, the Company prepaid the full amount of amortization for Term Loan A-1, which totaled   $40 million  .  
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2013, which provided for a   $500 million   unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature on December 11, 2018. 
    
  The interest rate margins applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to either, at the Company's option, (i) a base rate, plus an applicable margin, which ranges from   0.25%   to   1.25%  , in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A-1, and from   0.50%   to   1.50%  , in the case of Term Loan A-2, or (ii) an adjusted London interbank offered rate (adjusted for maximum reserves), or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, which ranges from   1.25%   to   2.25%  , in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A-1, and from   1.50%   to   2.50%  , in the case of Term Loan A-2. The applicable margin, in each case, will be adjusted from time to time based on the Company's ratio of net debt to EBITDA as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.  As of September 30, 2016, the average interest rate on outstanding Amended Credit Agreement borrowings was   2.31%   on US Revolving Credit Facility borrowings,   1.75%   on Euro Revolving Credit Facility borrowings,   2.31%   on Term Loan A-1 borrowings and   2.56%   on Term Loan A-2 borrowings.  The weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately   2.34%   and   1.44%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.   
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement also contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that, among other things, require   the Company to maintain (a) a maximum net debt  
  
    16 

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

to EBITDA ratio of 3.50, reducing to 3.00 after September 30, 2016 and (b) minimum interest coverage of 3.00.   The Amended Credit Agreement contains provisions allowing the Company to increase the leverage ratio upon the incurrence of certain unsecured indebtedness or temporarily upon the occurrence of a material acquisition.    The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016.    
    
  In conjunction with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company capitalized approximately   $7.4 million   in deferred debt issuance costs associated with the new facility which will be amortized over the term of the related debt instrument.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's total deferred debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, were   $7.4 million   and   $8.7 million  , respectively.  Amortization expense of   $1.3 million   and   $0.4 million   was recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and has been included as a component of Interest Expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.   
    
  Fair Value of Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair values of the Company s current and long-term debt approximated the respective carrying amounts as the interest rates were variable and based on current market indices. 

Note   11  . Derivatives 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt. To manage these risks, the Company utilizes a variety of practices including, where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company has no derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes or derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features. All derivative instruments used by the Company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using observable inputs and are considered Level 2 assets or liabilities. 
    
  The Company utilizes currency forward, swap and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk when it is practical and economical to do so. The use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes.  We designate certain of our foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For foreign exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the contracts  fair value are recorded to net income each period.   
    
  The Company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on variable-rate, long-term debt when it is practical and economical to do so. Changes in the fair value of interest rate contracts considered cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Note   12  . Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Litigation 
    
  Imposto sobre Circula  o de Mercadorias e Servi os, or ICMS, a form of value-added tax in Brazil, was assessed to our Brazilian subsidiary Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil Ind stria e Com rcio de Papel Ltda., or SWM-B, in December  2000.   SWM-B received   two   assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS taxes on certain raw materials from January 1995 through November 2000, collectively the Raw Materials Assessments. 
    
  The Raw Materials Assessments concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of paper sold domestically that are immune from the tax to offset ICMS taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not immune. SWM-B has contested the Raw Materials Assessments based on Article 150, VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, which grants immunity from ICMS  
  
    18

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

taxes to papers intended for printing books, newspapers and periodicals, or immune papers, and thus to the raw material inputs used to produce immune papers.   One   of the   two   assessments, or Assessment 1 (case number 2001.001.115144-5), related in part to tax periods that predated our acquisition of the Pirahy mill in Pirai, Brazil.  In October 2015, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil denied the State s appeal of Assessment 1, in the amount of approximately   $16.0 million  , a decision which is now final.  The second assessment, or Assessment 2 (case number 2001.001.064544-6), pertains exclusively to periods during which SWM-B owned the Pirahy mill.  Assessment 2 in the amount of approximately   $14.0 million   remains pending before the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil on SWM-B s appeal on the merits and is likely to be finally decided by the action of the chamber of the court hearing the matter.  No docket entry has been made yet regarding argument on Assessment 2.    
    
  SWM-B received assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS and Fundo Estadual de Combate   Pobreza (FECP, a value-added tax similar to ICMS) taxes on interstate purchases of electricity.  The State issued   three   sets of assessments against SWM-B, one for May 2006 - November 2007, a second for January 2008 - December 2010, and a third for September 2011 - September 2013, collectively the Electricity Assessments.  SWM-B has challenged all three Electricity Assessments in administrative proceedings before the State tax council (in the first-level court Junta de Revis o Fiscal and the appellate court Conselho de Contribuintes) based on Resolution 1.610/89, which defers these taxes on electricity purchased by an "electricity-intensive consumer."  In October and November 2014, a majority of the Conselho de Contribuintes sitting en banc ruled against SWM-B in each of the first and second Electricity Assessments. The State issued notices to SWM-B to pay approximately   $5.0 million   in the first Electricity Assessment and   $9.0 million   in the second Electricity Assessment, based on the foreign currency exchange rate at September 30, 2016.  SWM-B filed separate challenges to these Electricity Assessments in further court proceedings in the State judicial system, and different chambers of the judicial court granted SWM-B preliminary injunctions against enforcement.  On the State's appeal, the court required SWM-B to post security for the injunction concerning the Electricity Assessment for May 2006 - November 2007.  In September 2016, the first-level administrative court (Junta de Revis o Fiscal) ruled against SWM-B's challenge to the third Electricity Assessment (approximately   $4.0 million   as of September 30, 2016), a decision which SWM-B plans to appeal to the Conselho de Contribuintes.     
    
  SWM-B believes that both the remaining Raw Materials Assessment and the Electricity Assessments will ultimately be resolved in its favor.  No liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these assessments based on our evaluation of these matters under the facts and law as presently understood. The Company can give no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such proceedings. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  The Company's operations are subject to various nations' federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to environmental matters. The nature of the Company's operations exposes it to the risk of claims with respect to various environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. While the Company has incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, it believes that its future cost of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the remediation and monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations (including the enforcement thereof), or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators), or similar circumstances arising at our unconsolidated joint ventures, may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  General Matters    
    
  In the ordinary course of its business activities, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in certain other judicial, administrative and regulatory proceedings involving both private parties and governmental authorities. These proceedings include insured and uninsured regulatory, employment, general and commercial liability, environmental, intellectual property rights and other matters. At this time, the Company does not expect any of these proceedings to have an adverse material effect on its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
  
    19 

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

However, as the outcomes of such proceedings are unpredictable, the Company can give no assurance that the results of any such proceedings will not materially affect its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

Note   13  . Postretirement and Other Benefits 
    
  The Company sponsors pension benefits in the United States, France and Canada and OPEB benefits related to postretirement healthcare and life insurance in the United States and Canada. The Company s Canadian pension and OPEB benefits are not material and therefore are not included in the following disclosures. 
    
  Pension and OPEB Benefits 
    
  The components of net pension and OPEB benefit costs for U.S. employees and net pension benefit costs for French employees during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 were as follows ($ in millions): 

During the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, the Company expects to recognize approximately   $3.9 million   for amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to its U.S. pension and OPEB plans and approximately   $1.0 million   for its French pension plans.  

Note   14  . Income Taxes 
    
  For interim financial reporting, the Company estimates the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and records a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with ASC No. 740-270  Accounting for Income Taxes in Interim Periods.   These interim estimates are subject to variation due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast our pre-tax and taxable income and loss by jurisdiction, changes in laws or regulations, and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.  Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year or an actual year-to-date loss where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate.  The impact of including these jurisdictions on the quarterly effective tax rate calculations could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter, based upon the mix and timing of actual earnings verses annual projections.  Also, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible losses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. 

20 

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

All unrecognized tax positions would impact the Company's effective tax rate if recognized.  With respect to penalties and interest incurred from income tax assessments or related to unrecognized tax benefits, the Company s policy is to classify penalties as provision for income taxes and interest as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income. There were no material income tax penalties or interest accrued during the   three or nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or 2015. 
    
  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was   38.8%   and   18.8%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and increased primarily due to a higher concentration of profits generated in higher-tax jurisdictions coupled with a reduction in the generation of certain foreign tax credits and one-time discrete tax expense items.  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was   30.6%   and   21.7%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and increased primarily due to the same reasons as during the quarterly periods. 

Note   15  . Segment Information 
    
  The Company's   two   operating product line segments are also the Company's reportable segments: Engineered Papers and Advanced Materials   Structures. The EP segment, which consists of the Company's former Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco segments, primarily produces Cigarette Papers including LIP papers, plug wrap papers and base tipping papers used to wrap various parts of a cigarette for sale to cigarette manufacturers and RTL and wrapper and binder products for sale to cigarette and cigar manufacturers. The EP segment also includes commercial and industrial products such as lightweight printing and writing papers, battery separator paper, drinking straw wrap, filter paper and other specialized papers. These non-tobacco industry products are generally sold directly to converters and other end-users or brokers. The AMS segment primarily produces engineered resin-based, rolled goods such as films, nets, and other non-wovens for use in high-performance filtration, surface protection, medical, and industrial applications and consists of the operations of DelStar, Inc., the December 2014 acquisition of Pronamic Industries, Inc. and Smith   Nephew's Advanced Wound Management Division, and Argotec.  In conjunction with the consolidation of the Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco segments into the EP segment in October 2015, the corresponding information for all prior periods presented has been restated to correspond to the presentation in the current year. 
    
  Information about Net Sales and Operating Profit 
    
  The accounting policies of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company primarily evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating profit. Expense amounts not associated with segments are referred to as unallocated expenses.  The Company has recast the prior period operating profit by segment for comparative purposes to conform to current year presentation, which reflects a change in the way certain internal charges are allocated to individual business units. These changes had no impact on consolidated operating profit and were not material to the segment measurements presented.

Summary 

Third Quarter Highlights 
    
  In the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , SWM reported net income of   $18.7 million   on total net sales of   $209.3 million  .  Compared to the prior-year period, net sales increased   $24.9 million   due primarily to incremental net sales generated from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business and favorable net foreign currency translation impacts in our EP segment, partially offset by the net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices in our EP segment.  Additionally, our AMS segment was impacted by a decline in certain air filtration sales, planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales, and a decline in water filtration sales, which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Gross profit increased by   $10.7 million   to   $63.1 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $52.4 million   in the prior-year period primarily due to incremental gross profit generated by the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business along with the impact of operational improvements and overall favorable foreign currency translation impacts.  These factors were partially offset by other factors, including the net combined unfavorable impact of changes in overall volumes, mix of products sold, and average selling prices in the EP segment and the impact of a  
  
    23 

decline in certain air filtration sales, planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales, and a decline in water filtration sales, which offset growth in other filtration end-markets, in the AMS segment. 
    
  Cash provided by operations was   $30.8 million   in the third quarter of 2016 compared to   $24.5 million   in the prior-year period. The   $6.3 million   increase was due primarily to favorable net changes in operating working capital partially offset by lower net income compared to the prior-year period.  Uses of cash during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   included   $7.8 million   of capital spending,   $12.2 million   cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders and   $66.8 million   in net repayments of debt. 
    
  Year-to-Date Highlights 
    
  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , SWM reported net income of   $65.8 million   on total net sales of   $641.2 million  .  Compared to the prior-year period, net sales increased   $86.9 million   due primarily to incremental net sales generated from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business, partially offset by the net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices in our EP segment and unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts.  Our AMS segment was also impacted by planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales and a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Gross profit increased by   $34.9 million   to   $193.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $158.6 million   in the prior-year period primarily due to incremental gross profit generated by the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business along with the net combined impact of  operational improvements and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold, and average selling prices in our EP segment and favorable net foreign currency impacts.  These factors were partially offset by other factors, including planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales and the associated unfavorable fixed cost absorption in our AMS segment along with a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Cash provided by operations was   $83.0 million   in the first nine months of 2016 compared to   $80.2 million   in the prior-year period. The   $2.8 million   increase was due primarily to favorable changes in net working capital, partially offset by lower net income and a dividend received from our equity affiliate in the prior year.  Uses of cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included   $17.5 million   of capital spending,   $36.6 million   cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders, and   $131.6 million   in net repayments of debt.

  Net Sales 
  ($ in millions) 

Net sales were   $209.3 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $184.4 million   in the prior-year period.  The   increase   in net sales consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

EP segment net sales during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $136.8 million   decreased by   $5.6 million  , or   3.9%  , versus net sales of   $142.4 million   in the prior year quarter.  The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the $9.0 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices and $0.1 million in lower royalties, partially offset by $3.5 million in favorable net foreign currency translation impacts, primarily from a stronger euro, in each case compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  AMS segment net sales were     $72.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $42.0 million   during the prior-year period.  The increase of   $30.5 million   or   72.6%   was due primarily to $32.8 million in incremental net sales generated by the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business, partially offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts, mainly from a weaker British pound and Chinese yuan.  Absent the impact of the Argotec acquisition and currency movements, AMS segment net sales decreased $1.1 million primarily due to a decline in certain air filtration sales, planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales, and a decline in water filtration sales, which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Gross Profit 
  ($ in millions) 

Gross profit increased by   $10.7 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $63.1 million   versus the prior-year period of   $52.4 million  . In the EP segment, the $2.8 million net combined favorable impact of operational improvements and lower input costs along with $1.9 million net favorable foreign currency translation impacts were partially offset by the $3.4 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in overall volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices.  The AMS segment benefited from $9.5 million in incremental gross profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business and $1.0 million in operational improvements and lower input costs, partially offset by the $0.8 million impact of lower net sales, primarily from a decline in certain air filtration  
  
    25 

sales, planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales, and a decline in water filtration sales, which offset growth in other filtration end-markets, and $0.3 million of unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts. 
    
  Nonmanufacturing Expenses 
  ($ in millions) 

Nonmanufacturing expenses in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $11.7 million   to   $31.0 million   from   $19.3 million   in the prior-year period due primarily to $4.4 million in higher incremental costs from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business and $7.6 million in higher general and administrative expenses including the combined impact of modestly higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, professional services fees, higher intangible assets amortization expense and general increases in other expenses, primarily due to timing of expenses year over year, along with $0.1 million in higher research and development expenditures.  These factors were partially offset by $0.4 million in lower selling expenses. 
    
  Restructuring and Impairment Expense 
  ($ in millions) 

The Company incurred total restructuring and impairment expense of   $1.3 million   in each of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. In the 2016 period, the restructuring expense primarily related to $1.3 million in severance accruals for employees at our EP manufacturing operations related to the implementation of previously announced voluntary retirement programs available to certain employees at our French manufacturing facilities.  This restructuring expense will be accrued over the remaining service lives of the affected employees. 
    
  In the 2015 period, the restructuring expense primarily related to the implementation of a previously announced voluntary retirement program available to certain employees at our French manufacturing facilities. This restructuring expense will be accrued over the remaining service lives of the affected employees, of which $1.4 million was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015. During 2015, we also reversed $0.1 million related to accruals for severance expenses previously recognized within supporting overhead departments which were not allocated to a specific segment.

Operating Profit 
  ($ in millions) 

Operating profit was   $30.8 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $31.8 million   during the prior-year period. 
    
  The EP segment's operating profit in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $32.0 million  , an increase of   $1.0 million  , or   3.2%  , from   $31.0 million   in the prior-year period.  The increase was primarily due to the $2.8 combined net impact of operational improvements and lower input costs, along with $1.9 million in net favorable foreign currency translation impacts, which were partially offset by the $3.4 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in overall volumes, mix of products sold, and average selling prices and $0.3 million net impact of higher nonmanufacturing expenses. 
    
  The AMS segment's operating profit in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $8.7 million   compared to   $4.8 million   in the prior-year period.  The increase of   $3.9 million  , or   81.3%  , was positively impacted by $5.1 million in incremental operating profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business and the combined impact of $1.0 million in operational improvements and lower input costs; these factors were partially offset by $0.4 million in unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts and includes the combined $1.8 million impact of a decline in net sales, including certain air filtration sales, planned reductions of low-margin industrial sales, and a decline in water filtration sales, which offset growth in other filtration end-markets, along with higher net nonmanufacturing expenses compared to the prior period. 
    
  Unallocated expenses in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $9.9 million   compared to   $4.0 million   in the prior-year period. The increase of   $5.9 million  , or   147.5%  , in unallocated expenses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period was primarily attributable to the combined impact of modestly higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, professional services fees and general increases in other expenses, primarily due to timing of expenses year over year. 
    
  Non-Operating Expenses 
    
  Interest expense was   $3.9 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase from   $1.7 million   in the prior-year period.  The weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 2.42% and 1.47% for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The increase in interest expense is due to higher debt balances outstanding compared to the prior-year period in conjunction with the Argotec acquisition as well as the effect of the higher effective interest rate applied to borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement which was executed in October 2015 when compared to our previous credit agreement. 
    
  Other income, net, was   $0.7 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The   $0.6 million   decrease in other income, net compared to   $1.3 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was due primarily to lower interest income from lower cash balances outstanding during the third quarter of 2016 and lower royalty income from our joint ventures in China, partially offset by lower net foreign currency transaction losses compared to the prior-year period 

27 

Income Taxes 
    
  A   $10.7 million   provision for income taxes in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted in an effective tax rate of   38.8%   compared with   18.8%   in the prior-year period.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributed to a higher concentration of profits generated in higher-tax jurisdictions coupled with a reduction in the generation of certain foreign tax credits in 2016 compared to the prior-year period and incurrence of certain one-time discrete tax expense items in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  Income from Equity Affiliates 
    
  Income from equity affiliates was   $1.8 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $0.1 million   during the prior-year period and reflected the results of operations of CTM and CTS. The increase in earnings was driven primarily by higher sales volumes at CTS in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Because we closed our Philippines paper mill as previously reported, the results of this mill were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consequently, this mill's results have been removed from each line of the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of the discontinued operation.  
    
  Net Income and Income per Share 
    
  Net income in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $18.7 million  , or   $0.61   per diluted share, compared with   $25.8 million  , or   $0.85   per diluted share, during the prior-year period.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to the combined net unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices in our EP segment and, in our AMS segment, the impact of sales declines in certain end-markets.  Additionally, the Company was impacted by higher income tax expense and higher general expenses.  These factors were partially offset by incremental income earned from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business as well as a net combined favorable impact of operational improvements in the EP segments, overall favorable net foreign currency translation impacts, and higher income from our equity affiliates.

N.M. - Not Meaningful 
    
  Net sales were   $641.2 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $554.3 million   in the prior-year period.  The   increase   in net sales consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

EP segment net sales during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $425.7 million   decreased by   $5.5 million   versus net sales of   $431.2 million   in the prior-year period.  The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the $5.4 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices and $0.4 million impact of lower royalties received, partially offset by $0.3 million in favorable net foreign currency translation impacts, primarily from a stronger euro, in each case compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  AMS segment net sales were     $215.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $123.1 million   during the prior-year period.  The increase of   $92.4 million   or   75.1%   was due primarily to $97.2 million in incremental net sales generated by the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business. This was partially offset by several factors, including $2.2 million of unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts, mainly from a weaker British pound and Chinese yuan and $2.6 million combined impact primarily from planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which offset growth in other filtration end-markets.  
    
  Gross Profit 
  ($ in millions) 

Gross profit increased by   $34.9 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $193.5 million   versus the prior-year period of   $158.6 million  .  In the EP segment, the $7.8 million net favorable combined impact of operational improvements and lower input costs and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, along with $2.8 million in favorable net foreign currency translation impacts and $0.7 million in lower distribution costs were partially offset by the $0.4 million impact of lower royalty income.  The AMS segment benefited from $27.2 million in incremental gross profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business, partially  
  
    29 

offset by $0.7 million in unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts as well as a combined $2.5 million impact of a decline in net sales, primarily from planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and associated unfavorable fixed cost absorption along with a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Nonmanufacturing Expenses 
  ($ in millions) 

Nonmanufacturing expenses in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $19.8 million   to   $89.6 million   from   $69.8 million   in the prior-year period due primarily to $13.2 million in higher incremental costs from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business along with $1.4 million in higher research and development and selling expenditures and $5.6 million in higher general and administrative expenses including the combined impact of modestly higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, professional services fees, higher intangible asset amortization expense and general increases in other expenses, primarily due to timing of expenses year over year.  These factors were partially offset by $0.4 million in favorable foreign currency translation impacts.   
    
  Restructuring and Impairment Expense 
  ($ in millions) 

The Company incurred total restructuring and impairment expense of   $4.0 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $10.5 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . In the 2016 period, the restructuring expense primarily related to $3.2 million in severance accruals for employees at our EP and AMS manufacturing operations in the U.S., France and Brazil, $0.3 million in severance accruals within supporting overhead departments not allocated to a specific segment and $0.5 million of impairment expense recognized on equipment at our Poland paper manufacturing facility. 
    
  In the comparable 2015 period, the restructuring expense primarily related to the implementation of a voluntary retirement program announced in late 2014 and available to certain employees at our French manufacturing facilities. This restructuring expense will be accrued over the remaining service lives of the affected employees, of which $7.0 million was recognized during the comparable 2015 period. During 2015, the Company also recognized a loss of $0.7 million on the sale of certain equipment from our mothballed Philippines site and $2.8 million of loss recognized to write down equipment at that same Philippines site to its expected recoverable sales value.

Operating Profit 
  ($ in millions) 

Operating profit was   $99.9 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $78.3 million   during the prior-year period. 
    
  The EP segment's operating profit in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $103.4 million  , an increase of   $17.7 million  , or   20.7%  , from   $85.7 million   in the prior-year period.  The increase was primarily due to the $7.8 million net combined impact of operational improvements and lower input costs and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, $3.2 million in favorable net foreign currency translation impacts, $0.6 million in lower distribution costs and $7.4 million in lower restructuring expenses which were partially offset by the $0.4 million impact of lower royalty income along with the $0.9 million impact of higher nonmanufacturing expenses. 
    
  The AMS segment's operating profit in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $22.8 million   compared to   $12.8 million   in the prior-year period.  The increase of   $10.0 million  , or   78.1%  , was positively impacted by $14.0 million in incremental operating profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business, partially offset by $0.7 million in unfavorable net foreign currency translation impacts and $0.8 million in higher restructuring expenses.  The AMS segment was also impacted by other factors, including a combined $2.5 million impact of a decline in net sales, including planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and associated unfavorable fixed cost absorption along with a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which offset growth in other filtration end-markets. 
    
  Unallocated expenses in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $26.3 million   compared to   $20.2 million   in the prior-year period. The increase of   $6.1 million  , or   30.2%  , in unallocated expenses during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to the combined impact of modestly higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, professional services fees and general increases in other expenses, primarily due to timing of expenses year over year. 
    
  Non-Operating Expenses 
    
  Interest expense was   $12.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase from   $5.3 million   in the prior-year period.  The weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 2.34% and 1.44% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The increase in interest expense is due to higher debt balances outstanding compared to the prior-year period in connection with the Argotec acquisition as well as the effect of the higher effective interest rate applied to borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement executed in October 2015 when compared to our previous credit agreement. 
    
  Other income, net, was   $4.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The   $5.5 million   decrease in other income, net compared to   $9.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was due primarily to $2.5 million lower gain recognized related to the sale of water rights at our Spotswood, New Jersey facility, $2.2 million in lower interest income from lower cash balances outstanding during the quarter, and $1.2 million in lower royalties and fees earned from our joint ventures in China partially offset by $0.6 million in lower net currency losses, in each case compared to the prior-year period. 

31 

Income Taxes 
    
  A   $27.9 million   provision for income taxes in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulted in an effective tax rate of   30.6%   compared with   21.7%   in the prior-year period.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributed to a higher concentration of profits generated in higher-tax jurisdictions coupled with a reduction in the generation of certain foreign tax credits in 2016 compared to the prior-year period and incurrence of certain one-time discrete tax expense items in 2016.  
    
  Income from Equity Affiliates 
    
  Income from equity affiliates was   $2.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $4.3 million   during the prior-year period and reflected the results of operations of CTM and CTS. The decrease in earnings was driven primarily by lower sales volumes at CTS in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior-year period.  In April 2016, CTM temporarily suspended production in order to bring its operations into compliance with newly effective emissions standards in China.  In June, it resumed operations.  At this time, we do not expect this to have a material adverse impact on our financial results this year. 
    
     Discontinued Operations 
    
  Because we closed our Philippines  paper mill as previously reported, the results of this mill were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consequently, this mill's results have been removed from each line of the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of the discontinued operation.  
    
  Net Income and Income per Share 
    
  Net income in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $65.8 million  , or   $2.15   per diluted share, compared with   $68.0 million  , or   $2.22   per diluted share, during the prior-year period.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher expenses from income taxes, interest, intangible asset amortization and other general expenses, the impact of sales declines in certain end-markets in the AMS segment along with lower income from our equity affiliates, lower interest income and lower gain on sale of water rights compared to the prior period.  These factors were partially offset by incremental income earned from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business as well as lower restructuring expenses, primarily in our EP segment, and the net combined impact of operational improvements and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold, and average selling prices, along with favorable net foreign currency translation impacts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company has created a long-term capital allocation strategy which is focused on the following: 

Reinvesting capital in businesses through a disciplined approach to meet global demand for value-adding solutions; 

Returning at least one-third of annual free cash flow to stockholders via dividends and/or share repurchase programs; and 

Retaining flexibility to execute growth opportunities in current and adjacent industries. 
       
  A major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, sales volume and selling prices of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs, foreign currency exchange rates and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our Amended Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $67.9 million of the Company's   $89.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries.  Movement of cash balances may have significant tax consequences. We established a holding company in Luxembourg in 2014.  As a result of the holding company structure, a portion of the foreign earnings will flow directly to the U.S. without U.S. tax consequences.  We consider the undistributed earnings of other foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.  We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without further repatriation of the cash held by these other foreign subsidiaries.  Certain global business realignments and other activities have been, or may be, implemented that could permit the eventual repatriation of certain additional funds without material adverse U.S. tax consequences. 
    
  Capital spending for 2016 is projected to be approximately $30 million.  We generally fund our capital projects using cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, including the Amended Credit Agreement.  
    
  Cash Requirements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had net operating working capital of   $146.4 million   and cash and cash equivalents of   $89.5 million  , compared with net operating working capital of   $118.5 million   and cash and cash equivalents of   $186.5 million   as of December 31, 2015.  These changes primarily reflect the impacts of changes in currency exchange rates, net repayments of debt and changes in operating working capital presented on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flow contained in this report. 

33 

Net cash provided by operations was   $83.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared with   $80.2 million   in the prior-year period. Our net cash provided by operations increased primarily due to the   $8.1 million   favorable impact year-over-year of net change in operating working capital, partially offset by lower net income and a dividend received from our equity affiliate in the prior year. 

In the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , net changes in operating working capital used cash of   $14.4 million   compared to the prior-year period, in which net changes in operating working capital used cash of   $22.5 million  . This favorable change in working capital compared to the   nine months ended September 30,   2015 was primarily driven by a lower increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable, a higher reduction in accrued expenses and lower increase in accrued income taxes in 2016 compared to the prior-year period. 

34 

In the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , net changes in operating working capital used cash of   $22.5 million   compared to the prior-year period, in which net changes in operating working capital used cash of $27.6 million. This favorable change in working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in income taxes payable from a refund of prior year taxes paid in France, partially offset by increases in inventory compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Cash used for investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was   $15.0 million   compared to   $12.2 million   in the prior-year period and consisted primarily of capital spending. 

During the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , financing activities consisted primarily of share repurchases of   $0.6 million   in connection with the surrender of shares by employees to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations related to equity awards which vested during the period, cash dividends of   $36.6 million   paid to SWM stockholders, and net repayments of borrowings of   $131.6 million  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  , financing activities consisted primarily of share repurchases of   $2.9 million  , cash dividends of   $34.7 million   paid to SWM stockholders, and net repayments of borrowings of   $32.4 million  . 
    
  Dividend Payments 
    
  We have declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock every fiscal quarter since the second quarter of 1996.  On   November 2, 2016  , we announced a cash dividend of $0.42 per share payable on   December 23, 2016   to stockholders of record as of   November 25, 2016  .  The covenants contained in our Amended Credit Agreement require that we maintain certain financial ratios, as disclosed in Note 10. Debt, of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, none of which under normal business conditions we would expect to materially limit our ability to pay such dividends.  We plan to continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our capital allocation strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities. 
    
  Share Repurchases 
    
  In the   nine months ended September 30,   2016, we repurchased   19,539   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $0.6 million   for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations.

In the   nine months ended September 30,   2015, we repurchased   63,365   shares of our common stock for   $2.9 million   for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations.  
    
  Debt Instruments and Related Covenants 

Net re  payments   of borrowings were   $131.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  .  With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our Amended Credit Agreement. 
    
  In October 2015, the Company, together with two of its Luxembourg-based wholly-owned holding subsidiaries, entered into the Amended Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion, consisting of a $650 million revolving credit facility maturing in October 2020, a $100 million Term Loan A-1 maturing in October 2020, and a $250 million Term Loan A-2 maturing in October 2022.  The Term Loans are generally subject to mandatory repayment out of the net cash proceeds of asset sales which are not reinvested in operating assets. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries while the obligations of the Luxembourg-based holding subsidiaries are secured by a pledge of certain of the equity interests held in their operating subsidiaries.  Unused borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement was   $515.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We also had availability under our bank overdraft facilities of   $28.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Amended Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of that type and covenants and provisions that, among other things, require the Company to maintain (a) a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.50, reducing to 3.00 after September 30, 2016 and (b) minimum interest coverage of 3.00. The Amended Credit Agreement contains provisions allowing the Company to increase the leverage ratio upon the incurrence of certain unsecured indebtedness or temporarily upon the occurrence of a material acquisition.  The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016  .  With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with our Amended Credit Agreement financial covenants. 
    
  Our total debt to capital ratios at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   45.8%   and   55.0%  , respectively. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
    
  Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our pension obligations are funded by our separate pension trusts, which held $125.1 million in assets at December 31, 2015. The combined projected benefit obligation of our U.S. and French pension plans was underfunded by $30.5 million as of December 31, 2015. We make contributions to our pension trusts based on many factors, including regulatory guidelines, investment returns of the trusts and availability of cash for pension contributions compared to other priorities. We are not required to make contributions to our U.S. and French pension plans during 2016.

The EP segment's PDM Industries S.A.S., or PDMI, mill has a minimum annual commitment for calcium carbonate purchases, a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products, which totals approximately $2 million per year through 2024.  Future purchases are expected to be at levels that exceed such minimum levels under these contracts.  
    
  The Company has agreements with an energy cogeneration supplier in France whereby the supplier constructed and operates a cogeneration facility at certain of our mills and supplies steam that is used in the operation of these mills.  The Company is committed to purchasing minimum annual amounts of steam generated by these facilities under the agreements through 2024. These minimum annual commitments total approximately $3 million. The Company's current and expected requirements for steam at these facilities are at levels that exceed the minimum levels under the contracts.  
    
  Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil Industria e Com rcio de Papel Ltda., our EP segment's Brazilian mill, has an agreement for the transmission and distribution of energy that covers 100% of the mill's consumption of electrical energy valued at approximately $4 million annually through 2020.  Our EP mills in France have contracts for the distribution and consumption of natural gas.  The value to be provided under these natural gas contracts is estimated at approximately $10 million in 2016.  

Outlook 
    
  As our strategic transformation progresses, we believe that our growth outlook will continue to be influenced by the global tobacco industry, and increasingly influenced by the end-segments of our AMS business, including filtration, surface protection, medical, and industrials. 
    
  For the EP segment, we expect our outlook and performance to be driven by many factors, including 1) customer-specific patterns, such as RTL usage, cigarette paper inventory management and timing of purchases, 2) macro factors, such as the expected long-term trend of reduced cigarette consumption and foreign exchange movements, and 3) potential regulatory changes in the tobacco industry, such as mandated packaging changes and/or tax-related price increases, or potential new countries adopting LIP regulations.  While not consolidated into our EP segment, our tobacco operations seek to capitalize on the large Chinese cigarette industry through our two joint ventures.  For example, we expect increased demand in the long-term for RTL in China, which we are strategically positioned to supply through CTS, our RTL joint venture in China.  
    
  For the AMS segment, we expect our growth outlook to be driven by demand across our primary end-segments.  Despite current sales decreases, we expect water filtration to continue its long-term growth trends; however, our filtration products sold to customers sensitive to the oil, gas, and mining sectors have been adversely impacted by the volatility and reduced activity in those industries. We expect solid growth performance from the Argotec acquisition, driven by continued growth in the surface protection end-segment.  Generally, we believe that our medical and industrial end-segments will perform relatively in line with broad economic growth in the U.S. and to some extent Europe and China.  We continue to evaluate M A and internal growth investment opportunities to increase the scale of AMS and improve profitability of this growth platform. 
    
  2016 Strategic Priorities 
    
  We expect our business to be impacted by a combination of factors, the net result of which is an expected decline in profits in 2016 compared to prior years.  Positive business factors include incremental profits from the Argotec acquisition and expected internal improvements in the EP and AMS segment operations.  These positive business factors are expected to be more than offset by anticipated declines in RTL volumes in our French mill, the non-recurrence of certain 2015 tax benefits, year-over-year negative currency translation comparison, and the expected reversal of a customer-driven inventory build of LIP cigarette papers that benefited fourth quarter 2015 and first quarter 2016 results. 
    
  With our diversification activities since 2013, the Company has increased its revenue concentration from 6% of total Net Sales derived outside of the tobacco industry in 2013 to approximately 30% in 2015.  The Company expects this metric to continue to increase in 2016 to the 40+% range due to the addition of a full year's revenue from Argotec, expected improved organic growth in our AMS segment, and the anticipated sales impact from an expected volume decline of more than 10% in RTL from the prior year. 
  
    37 

The Company's key 2016 strategic priorities include continuing to integrate Argotec, optimizing AMS segment operations and improving AMS operating margins, which includes steps taken to rationalize product lines, improve product quality and consistency, and implement an integrated AMS shared services enterprise resource planning platform across the acquired businesses.  We expect this to deliver meaningful multi-year margin expansion, and, when combined with benefits of increased scale and synergies across a more integrated operation, we would expect higher total AMS profits ultimately resulting in a more balanced split of our profit pool between our tobacco and non-tobacco businesses.  
    
  Concurrently, the Company plans to continue evaluating further acquisitions and growth initiatives that complement its existing AMS technologies and end-segment exposures.  For the EP segment, the Company plans to remain focused on efficiently managing and restructuring operations to match capacity and costs with demand, selectively using price concessions to gain and/or maintain market share in key product categories, and protecting our intellectual property as appropriate in key areas, such as LIP.  We plan to continue to invest in diversification activities to monetize our EP segment technologies outside of the tobacco industry.

  Adoption of 2016 Executive Severance Plan 
    
  On November 2, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted and approved the Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. 2016 Executive Severance Plan (the  Severance Plan ) for members of the Company s senior executive team.  The Severance Plan is intended to replace the Company s 2012 Executive Severance Plan and provides for the payment of severance and other benefits to eligible senior executives in the event of a termination of employment with the Company.  Specifically, the Severance Plan provides that in the event of a qualifying termination of a participant s employment with the Company or certain of its affiliates within two years after a Change in Control (as defined in the Severance Plan), a participant will be entitled to: 

a cash payment in an amount equal to 3 times the highest annual compensation (base salary and annual incentive awards) paid or payable within the 3-year period ending on the date of termination; and 
                
    specified health care and other benefits from the Company for a period of 3 years. 
       
  For qualifying terminations not following a Change in Control, a participant will be entitled to: 

a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the participant s annual base salary divided by 12 and (ii) the number of months of severance set forth in the participation agreement with such participant (provided that such amount shall not be more than the participant s monthly base salary multiplied by 24); and 
                
    specified health care and other benefits from the Company for the number of months of severance set forth in the participation agreement with such participant (not to exceed 24 months). 
       
  In addition to generally updating various provisions of the plan, the Severance Plan differs from the prior version principally by providing for continued benefits during the  severance period  in the absence of a change of control and eliminating the six month waiting period before the Severance Plan is effective for new eligible executives. The foregoing summary of the Severance Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Severance Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

  (A)    for U.S. Employees, all benefits under the group health care plan, dental care plan, or other present or future similar group employee benefit plan or program of the Company for which Key Employees are eligible at the date of a Change of Control (or, if not permitted by the applicable plan or applicable law or which would result in adverse tax consequences to the Company, a comparable plan established by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the same extent as if the Participant had continued to be an employee of the Company during such period and such benefits shall, to the extent not fully paid under any such plan or program, be paid by the Company; and 
    
  (B)     for Foreign Employees, all medical benefits provided by, as applicable, the medical and life insurance or death benefit plans, or other present or future similar medical, life or other insurance or death benefit plans or programs generally available to Foreign Employees for which such Participant is eligible at the date of the Change of Control (or, if not permitted by the applicable plan or applicable law or which would result in adverse tax consequences to the Company, a comparable plan established by the Foreign Employer to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the same extent as if the Participant had continued to be a Foreign Employee during such period and such benefits shall, to the extent not fully paid under any such plan or program, be paid by the Foreign Employer.

  (d)    If the payments to the Participant pursuant to this Plan (when considered with all other payments made to the Participant that are required to be taken into account under Code Section 280G(b)(2)) (the amount of all such payments, collectively, the    Parachute Payment   ) would result in the Participant becoming liable for the payment of any excise taxes pursuant to Code Section 4999 (   280G Excise Tax   ), the Participant will receive the greater on an after-tax basis of (i) the Parachute Payment or (ii) the Parachute Payment as reduced to avoid imposition of the 280G Excise Tax (the    Conditional Capped Amount   ). In connection with the foregoing: 
    
  (i)    Not more than 14 days following the termination of his employment, the Company will notify the Participant in writing (A) whether the severance benefits payable pursuant to this Plan when added to any other Parachute Payments payable to Participant exceed an amount equal to 299% (the    299% Amount   ) of the Participant s  base amount  as defined in Code Section  
  
   6 

Exhibit 10.1

  (ii)    The calculation of the 299% Amount, the determination of whether the termination benefits described in this Plan (without adjustment) or the Conditional Capped Amount is greater on an after-tax basis and, if the Conditional Capped Amount is the greater amount, the determination of how much Participant s Parachute Payments must be reduced in order to avoid application of the 280G Excise Tax will be made by Company s independent public accounting firm at the time of the Change in Control or, if applicable, subsequent termination of employment, in accordance with section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto.  For purposes of making the reduction of amounts payable, such amounts shall be eliminated in the following order:  (A) any cash compensation, (B) any health or welfare benefits, (C) any equity compensation, and (D) any other payments.  Reductions of such amounts shall take place in the chronological order with respect to which such amounts would be paid from the date of the termination of the Participant s employment absent any acceleration of payment.  If the reduction of the amounts payable hereunder would not result in a reduction of the Parachute Payments to the Conditional Capped Amount, no amounts payable to the Participant shall be reduced pursuant to this provision.  The costs of obtaining such determination will be borne by Company.

  (b)    For the number of Severance Months set forth in the Participant s Agreement, the Participant (not to exceed 24) and anyone entitled to claim under or through the Participant shall be entitled to benefits, on a monthly basis, as follows: 
    
  (A)    for U.S. Employees, all benefits under the group health care plan and dental care plan, to the same extent as if the Participant had continued to be an employee of the Company during such period and such benefits shall, to the extent not fully paid under any such plan or program, be paid by the Company (or, if not permitted by the applicable plan or applicable  
  
   7

law or which would result in adverse tax consequences to the Company, a comparable plan established by the Company to the extent permitted by applicalbe law); and 
    
  (B)     for Foreign Employees, all medical benefits provided by, as applicable, the medical and life insurance or death benefit plans, or other present or future similar medical, life or other insurance or death benefit plans or programs generally available to Foreign Employees for which such Participant is eligible at the date of the termination of employment, to the same extent as if the Participant had continued to be a Foreign Employee during such period and such benefits shall, to the extent not fully paid under any such plan or program, be paid by the Foreign Employer (or, if not permitted by the applicable plan or applicable law or which would result in adverse tax consequences to the Company, a comparable plan established by the Foreign to the extent permitted by applicable law).

Any payments to be made, or benefits to be provided under this Plan within the 60 days following the Participant s termination of employment shall be accumulated and paid, or benefits delivered, after the foregoing release becomes effective and cannot be revoked, except that, if the 60-day period following the Participant s termination of employment covers more than one calendar year, no payments may be made, or benefits provided, under this Plan until the later calendar year.  Benefits may be provided earlier at Participant s expense with Participant having the right to reimbursement of such costs when payment is permitted as described above.

  7.4      Withholding.

Exhibit 10.1 

7.5      Assignment by the Participant  .  Unless required by court order, no Participant or beneficiary shall have any rights to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise convey the right to receive the payment of any benefit due hereunder, which payment and the rights thereto are expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable.  Any attempt to do so shall be null and void and of no effect. 
    
  7.6      Amendment and Termination.    The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by the Company, by resolution of the Board; provided that no termination or amendment reducing the severance benefits provided hereunder shall be effective until the expiration of the two year period following the date of the Board resolution providing for such termination.  Further, no amendment or termination shall be effective during the two year period following the date of a Change of Control of the Company without the unanimous consent of all the Participants.  Any termination of this Plan that becomes effective in accordance with this Section 7.6 shall cause the immediate termination of all outstanding Agreements hereunder.  No amendment or termination shall affect the rights of any Participant who is entitled to severance benefits pursuant to Article 4 at the time of such amendment or termination. 
    
  7.7      No Guarantee of Employment.    Participation hereunder shall not be construed as creating any contract of employment between the Company or a Foreign Employer and any Key Employee, nor shall it limit the right of the Company or such Foreign Employer to terminate a Key Employee's employment at any time for any reason whatsoever. 
    
  7.8         Clawback  .  To the extent required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any other applicable law, or the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, but to no greater extent, Participants agree to return payments made pursuant to this Plan to the Company.     
    
  7.9      Choice of Law.    This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent such laws are not otherwise superseded by the laws of the United States. To the extent required by foreign law, foreign participants shall be subject to the laws of the Participant s country of employment. 
    
  7.10      Construction.    The masculine pronoun shall be construed to include the feminine pronoun and singular shall include the plural where the context so requires. 
    
  ARTICLE 8   CODE SECTION 409A 
    
  8.1      Separation from Service  .  In the event that a Participant is or may be liable for Federal income taxes in the United States, for purposes of this Plan a termination of his or her employment shall be deemed to occur only upon the Participant s  separation from service,  as such term is defined in Code Section 409A (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition). 
    
  8.2      Additional Requirements Regarding Payments and Benefits  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, in the event that a Participant is or may be liable for Federal  
  
   12 

Exhibit 10.1 

income taxes in the United States and if any amount or benefit specified herein as  subject to  Section 8.2 would be payable or distributable under this Plan by reason of the Participant s separation from service at a time at which he is a Specified Employee (as hereafter defined), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by Employer under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes):  
    
  (a)    If the payment or distribution is payable in a lump sum, the Participant s right to receive payment or distribution of such non-exempt deferred compensation will be delayed until the earlier of the Participant s death or the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service; and 
    
  (b)    If the payment or distribution is payable over time, the amount of such non-exempt deferred compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following the Participant s separation from service will be accumulated and the Participant s right to receive payment or distribution of such accumulated amount will be delayed until the earlier of the Participant s death or the first day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service, whereupon the accumulated amount will be paid or distributed to the Participant and the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume.  All rights to payments or benefits under the Plan shall be treated as rights to a series of separate payments to the fullest extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code. 
    
  8.3      Specified Employee  .  For purposes of this Plan, the term  Specified Employee  has the meaning given such term in Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder, in accordance with rules adopted by the Board or a committee thereof, which shall be applied consistently with respect to all nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements of the Company, including this Plan, as to the determination of Specified Employees. 
    
  8.4      Reimbursements and In-Kind Benefits  .  In the event that a Participant is or may be liable for Federal income taxes in the United States, (a) reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Plan (or the amounts paid by the Company with respect to such benefits) in any one calendar year shall not affect the amount of reimbursements or in-kind benefits (or amounts paid with respect to such benefits) provided in any other calendar year; (b) the reimbursement of an eligible taxable expense shall be made as soon as practicable but not later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred; and (C) the Participant s rights to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Plan shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
    
  8.5      Anti-Substitution  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Plan, if and to the extent that amounts payable under this Plan are deemed, for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, to be in substitution of amounts previously payable under another arrangement with respect to Participant, such payments hereunder will be made at the same time(s) and in the same form(s) as such amounts would have been payable under the other arrangement, to the extent required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
