VANJIA CORPORATION  
          NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL
        STATEMENTS 
        SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  
             
          1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING
        POLICIES  
          Basis of Presentation  
         The accompanying unaudited condensed
        consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
        States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
        Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
        principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
        contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation
        of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The year-end condensed balance sheet
        data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations
        for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. These unaudited, condensed consolidated
        financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
        the notes thereto included in the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
          Organization and Nature of Business  
         Vanjia Corporation (formerly
        Vantone Realty Corporation), a company in the developmental stage (the  Company ), was incorporated on August 19, 2011
        in the State of Texas. The Company has conducted limited business operations and had no revenues from operations since its inception.
        The Company s business plan is to build affordable homes in Houston, Texas. 
         The Company s year-end is December 31. 
               
          Going Concern  
             These
        financial statements were prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to going concern, which assumes the realization
        of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the
        Company had an accumulated deficit of $59,801 as of September 30, 2016, and it had no revenue from operations.     The
        Company faces all the risks common to companies at development stage, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources,
        high initial expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams, and difficulties in managing growth. The Company's losses raise substantial
        doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that
        might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     The
        Company is currently addressing its liquidity issue by continually seeking investment capital through private placements of common
        stock and debt. The Company believes its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability
        to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this time. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments
        which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets
        and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts which may differ from those in the accompanying
        consolidated financial statements.  
          Use of Estimates  
         The preparation of financial
        statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to
        make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
        liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
        Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
          Cash and Cash Equivalents  
         Cash and cash equivalents include
        cash and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. 
          Impairment of long-lived assets  
           
         The Company reviews its long-lived assets whenever
        events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is evaluated by comparing
        the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
        of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying
        value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss at that date. An impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount
        by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value (estimated discounted future cash flows) of the long-lived assets. 
           
          Net Income (loss) per Share  
         Basic income (loss) per share
        is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted
        income per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents
        and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. At September 30, 2016, the Company does not have any outstanding
        common stock equivalents; therefore, a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented. 
          Income Taxes  
         The Company accounts for income
        taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based
        on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted
        tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the
        change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management,
        it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
          Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
         The Company does not expect
        the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its result of operations, financial position
        or cash flow. 
          2. INCOME TAXES  
         The Company has not yet realized income as
        of the date of this report, and no provision for income taxes has been made. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating
        loss carry forwards of approximately $39,827 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income. Future tax benefits
        which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined
        not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to
        these tax loss carry-forwards. 
             
          3. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
         The Company evaluated all events
        or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2016 up through the date the Company issued these financial statements. 
             
         7   

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  

This section of the prospectus includes a number
of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions,
or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place an undue certainty on these forward-looking statements,
which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

PLAN OF OPERATION  

Our plan of operations for the next
twelve months is to proceed with the implementation of our business plan. 

GOALS 
     
         PROJECT OUTCOMES 

Legal and Accounting Expenses 
     Compliance with financial reporting and internal controls  
 
     Website Design 
     Creation of our corporate website  
 
     Civil Engineer or Surveyor's Fees 
     Subdivision of lands  
 
     Architect drawings 
     Complete a set of plans for building permits  
 
     Project Consultants 
     Quality Control of construction project  
 
     Marketing and Promotion 
     Marketing and public awareness activities  
 
     Working Capital 
     Office supplies, telephone, postage and other miscellaneous expenses  

ACCOUNTING AND LEGAL EXPENSES - Our estimate
these related expenses will range from $5,500 for the next 12 months. After the effectiveness of this registration statement, we
will become a public company. We will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports
with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. 

CREATE OUR CORPORATE WEBSITE - It is part of our business
plan to have our website. A website can convey our corporate images and services to our potential customers. We believe our estimated
cost of $1,250 will be sufficient to cover our projected expense for website design. 

SURVEYOR'S FEES - We are required to
obtain surveyors' services related to subdivision of land. Our estimated cost for a surveyor' services will be $4,500. The Planning
Commission for the City of Houston is responsible for the review and approval of application for subdivision of land. 

 8 

ARCHITECT DRAWINGS - We are required
to obtain several sets of architect drawings in connection with our proposed construction projects. We estimated the cost for architect
drawings will be $5,000 to$7,500 per year. 

PROJECT CONSULTANTS - Once we have obtained
the necessary building permits from the City of Houston, we will be ready to build our residential homes. We will require to hire
project consultants to monitor the quality control of our construction projects. We intend to spent $6,300 to $12,600 annually
for project consultants. 

MARKETING AND PROMOTION - Our staff will
distribute our promotional fliers on foot, spending afternoons knocking on the doors of residences in targeted neighborhoods, as
well as residences already in designated HOPE and Workforce areas. Speaking with potential buyers directly is the best way to inform
and engage the communities. When speaking to residents, we will explain the Houston HOPE and Workforce programs, specifically mentioning
how these programs can benefit them as future owners of our new homes and services. We will then outline in further detail the
government assistance option available to them. The government can offer up to $30,000 for down payments and unlike renting, home
ownership allows one to build up home equity. 

The following table shows the projection of
our building activities for three years: 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

On September 30, 2016, our current assets was
$25,199 and our total liabilities were $-0- which resulted in working capital of $25,199 We expect to raise additional capital
through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities, private placement offerings, employee stock options plans,
and advanced funds from our officer and director. Any deficiencies in general and administrative expenses will be covered from
funds by our director and officer. Our officer and director, Tian Su Hua, has agreed to provide us a $100,000 line-of-credit at
-0- interest. The management believes that an existing $100,000 line-of-credit agreement with our officer and director will be
sufficient to cover our operational expense for the next twelve months. The residential lot we currently own is large enough to
accommodate up to eight homes. We believe that our future expenditures for the second and third years will be covered by revenues
generate from sell of new homes and additional offerings for equity or debt securities, private placement offerings, employee options
plans and funds from our officer and director. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

From August 19, 2011 (Inception) to September 30, 2016. 

During the period, our incorporation in the
State of Texas, we hired attorney for the preparation of this registration statement and our auditors to audit our financial statements.
We have prepared a business plan. Our accumulated loss since August 19, 2011 (Inception) to September 30, 2016 was $(59,801) for
general and administrative expenses.
