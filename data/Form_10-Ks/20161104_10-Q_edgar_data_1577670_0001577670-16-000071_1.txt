1.       ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS    
    
  Ladder Capital Corp is an internally-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that is a leader in commercial real estate finance. Ladder Capital Corp, as the general partner of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP ( LCFH,   Predecessor  or the  Operating Partnership ), operates the Ladder Capital business through LCFH and its subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , Ladder Capital Corp has a   59.5%   economic interest in LCFH and controls the management of LCFH as a result of its ability to appoint its board members. Accordingly, Ladder Capital Corp consolidates the financial results of LCFH and records noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in LCFH held by the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners (as defined below). In addition, Ladder Capital Corp, through certain subsidiaries which are treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a  TRS ), is indirectly subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Other than the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership and such indirect U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, there are no material differences between Ladder Capital Corp s combined consolidated financial statements and LCFH s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The IPO Transactions  
    
  Ladder Capital Corp was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 21, 2013. The Company conducted an initial public offering ( IPO ) which closed on February 11, 2014. The Company used the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase newly issued limited partnership units ( LP Units ) from LCFH. In connection with the IPO, Ladder Capital Corp also became a holding corporation and the general partner of, and obtained a controlling interest in, LCFH. Ladder Capital Corp s only business is to act as the general partner of LCFH, and, as such, Ladder Capital Corp indirectly operates and controls all of the business and affairs of LCFH and its subsidiaries through its ability to appoint the LCFH board. The proceeds received by LCFH in connection with the sale of the LP Units have been and will be used for loan origination and related real estate business lines and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  Ladder Capital Corp consolidates the financial results of LCFH and its subsidiaries. The ownership interest of certain existing owners of LCFH, who owned LP Units and an equivalent number of shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock as of the completion of the IPO (the  Continuing LCFH Limited Partners ) and continue to hold equivalent units in the Series of LCFH (as described below) and Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock, is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in Ladder Capital Corp s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO on February 11, 2014, LCFH effectuated certain transactions intended to simplify its capital structure (the  Reorganization Transactions ). Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, LCFH s capital structure consisted of   three   different classes of membership interests (Series A and Series B Participating Preferred Units and Class A Common Units), each of which had different capital accounts. The net effect of the Reorganization Transactions was to convert the multiple-class structure into LP Units, a single new class of units in LCFH, and an equal number of shares of Class B common stock of Ladder Capital Corp. The conversion of all of the different classes of LCFH occurred in accordance with conversion ratios for each class of outstanding units based upon the liquidation value of LCFH, as if it had been liquidated upon the IPO, with such value determined by the   $17.00   price per share of Class A common stock sold in the IPO. The distribution of LP Units per class of outstanding units was determined pursuant to the distribution provisions set forth in LCFH s amended and restated Limited Liability Limited Partnership Agreement (the  Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement ). In addition, in connection with the IPO, certain of LCFH s existing investors (the  Exchanging Existing Owners ) received   33,672,192   shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class A common stock in lieu of any or all LP Units and shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock that would otherwise have been issued to such existing investors in the Reorganization Transactions, which resulted in Ladder Capital Corp, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ladder Capital Corp, owning   one   LP Unit for each share of Class A Common Stock so issued to the Exchanging Existing Owners. 
    
  The IPO resulted in the issuance by Ladder Capital Corp of   15,237,500   shares of Class A common stock to the public, including   1,987,500   shares of Class A common stock offered as a result of the exercise of the underwriters  over-allotment option, and net proceeds to Ladder Capital Corp of   $238.5 million   (after deducting fees and expenses associated with the IPO). In addition, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted   1,687,513   shares of restricted Class A common stock to members of management, certain directors and certain employees. As a result, the equivalent number of LP Units were issued by LCFH to Ladder Capital Corp.

     Table of Contents  

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement, and subject to the applicable minimum retained ownership requirements and certain other restrictions, including notice requirements, from time to time, Continuing LCFH Limited Partners (or certain transferees thereof) had the right to exchange their LP Units for shares of Ladder Capital Corp s Class A common stock on a   one  -for-  one   basis. 
    
  As a result of the Company s acquisition of LP Units of LCFH and LCFH s election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), the Company expects to benefit from depreciation and other tax deductions reflecting LCFH s tax basis for its assets. Those deductions will be allocated to the Company and will be taken into account in reporting the Company s taxable income. 
    
  As a result of the transactions described above, at the time of the IPO: 

Ladder Capital Corp became the general partner of LCFH and, through LCFH and its subsidiaries, operates the Ladder Capital business. Accordingly, Ladder Capital Corp had a   51.0%   economic interest in LCFH (which has since increased), and Ladder Capital Corp has a majority voting interest and controls the management of LCFH;  

LP Units became exchangeable on a   one  -for-  one   basis for shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class A common stock. In connection with an exchange, a corresponding number of shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock were required to be provided and canceled. LP units and Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock could not be legally separated.  However, the exchange of LP Units for shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class A common stock would not affect the exchanging owners  voting power since the votes represented by the canceled shares of Ladder Capital Corp Class B common stock would be replaced with the votes represented by the shares of Class A common stock for which such LP Units were exchanged.  
       
  The Company accounted for the Reorganization Transactions as an exchange between entities under common control and recorded the net assets and shareholders  equity of the contributed entities at historical cost. 
    
  The Reorganization Transactions and the IPO are collectively referred to as the  IPO Transactions.  
    
  The REIT Structuring Transactions 
    
  In anticipation of the Company s election to be subject to tax as a REIT under the Code beginning with its 2015 taxable year (the  REIT Election ), we effected an internal realignment as of December 31, 2014 that we believe permits us to operate as a REIT, subject to the risk factors described in the Annual Report (see  Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT ). As part of this realignment, LCFH and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries were serialized in order to segregate our REIT-qualified assets and income from our non-REIT-qualified assets and income. Pursuant to such serialization, all assets and liabilities of LCFH and each such subsidiary were identified as TRS assets and liabilities (e.g., our conduit securitization and condominium sales businesses) and REIT assets and liabilities (e.g., balance sheet loans, real estate and most securities), and were allocated on our internal books and records into two pools within LCFH or such subsidiary, Series TRS and Series REIT (collectively, the  Series ), respectively. 
    
  In connection with this serialization, the Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement was amended and restated, effective as of December 5, 2014 and again as of December 31, 2014 (the  Third Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement ). Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement, as of December 31, 2014: 

all assets and liabilities of LCFH were allocated on LCFH s internal books and records to either Series REIT or Series TRS of LCFH; 

the Company serves as general partner of LCFH and of Series REIT of LCFH;

     Table of Contents  

LC TRS I LLC ( LC TRS I ), a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by Series REIT of LCFH, serves as the general partner of Series TRS of LCFH; 

each outstanding LP Unit was exchanged for one Series REIT limited partnership unit ( Series REIT LP Unit ), which is entitled to receive profits and losses derived from REIT assets and liabilities, and one Series TRS limited partnership unit ( Series TRS LP Unit ), which is entitled to receive profits and losses derived from TRS assets and liabilities (Series REIT LP Units and Series TRS LP Units are collectively referred to as  Series Units  

as a result, Ladder Capital Corp owned, directly and indirectly, an aggregate of   51.9%   of Series REIT of LCFH, and, through such ownership, the right to receive   51.9%   of the profits and distributions of Series TRS;  

the limited partners of LCFH owned the remaining   48.1%   of each of Series REIT and Series TRS of LCFH;  

Series REIT of LCFH, in turn, owns, directly or indirectly,   100%   of the REIT series of each of its serialized subsidiaries as well as certain wholly-owned REIT subsidiaries; 

Series TRS of LCFH owns, directly or indirectly,   100%   of the TRS series of each of its serialized subsidiaries, as well as certain wholly-owned TRSs;  

Series TRS LP Units are exchangeable for an equal number of shares ( TRS Shares ) of LC TRS I (a  TRS Exchange  

in order to effect the exchange of Series Units for shares of Class A common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis (the  Class A Exchange ), holders are required to surrender (i) one share of the Company s Class B common stock, (ii) one Series REIT LP Unit, and (iii) either one Series TRS LP Unit or one TRS Share; and  

Series REIT and Series TRS have separate boards, officers, books and records, bank accounts, and tax identification numbers. 
       
  Each Series of LCFH also signed a separate joinder agreement, agreeing, effective as of 11:59:59 pm on December 31, 2014 (the  Effective Time ), to assume and pay when due (i) any and all liabilities of LCFH incurred or accrued by LCFH as of the Effective Time and (ii) any and all obligations of LCFH arising under contracts, bonds, notes, guarantees, leases or other agreements to which LCFH was a party as of the Effective Time (collectively, the  Agreements ), regardless of whether such obligations arise under the applicable Agreement at, prior to, or after the Effective Time, in each case, with the same force and effect as if each Series had been a signatory to such Agreements on the date thereof. 
    
  Also in connection with the planned REIT Election, the Company s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated, effective as of February 27, 2015, following approval by our shareholders (the  Charter Amendment ), to, among other things, impose ownership limitations and transfer restrictions to facilitate our compliance with the REIT requirements. To qualify as a REIT under the Code, our stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer  individuals  (as defined to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). Finally, a person actually or constructively owning 10% or more of the vote or value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock could lead to a level of affiliation between the Company and one or more of its tenants that could disqualify our revenues from the affiliated tenants and possibly jeopardize or otherwise adversely impact our qualification as a REIT. 
    
  To facilitate satisfaction of these requirements for qualification as a REIT, the Charter Amendment contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of shares of all classes or series of our capital stock. Including ownership limitations in a REIT s charter is the most effective mechanism to monitor compliance with the above-described provisions of the Code. The Charter Amendment provides that, subject to certain exceptions and the constructive ownership rules, no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, in excess of (i)   9.8%   in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii)   9.8%   in value or number (whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of any class of our common stock.

In addition, our Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners (the  TRA Members ) was amended and restated in connection with our REIT Election, effective as of December 31, 2014 (the  TRA Amendment ), in order to preserve a portion of the potential tax benefits currently existing under the Tax Receivable Agreement that would otherwise be reduced in connection with our REIT Election. The TRA Amendment provides that, in lieu of the existing tax benefit payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for the 2015 taxable year and beyond, LC TRS I will pay to the TRA Members   85%   of the amount of the benefits, if any, that LC TRS I realizes or under certain circumstances (such as a change of control) is deemed to realize as a result of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from the TRS Exchanges by the TRA Members, (ii) any incremental tax basis adjustments attributable to payments made pursuant to the TRA Amendment, and (iii) any deemed interest deductions arising from payments made by LC TRS I under the TRA Amendment. Under the TRA Amendment, LC TRS I may benefit from the remaining   15%   of cash savings in income tax that it realizes, which is in the same proportion realized by the Company under the existing Tax Receivable Agreement. The purpose of the TRA Amendment was to preserve the benefits of the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent possible in a REIT, although, as a result, the amount of payments made to the TRA Members under the TRA Amendment is expected to be less than would be made under the prior Tax Receivable Agreement. The TRA Amendment continues to share such benefits in the same proportions and otherwise has substantially the same terms and provisions as the prior Tax Receivable Agreement. See   Note 2   and   Note 15   for further discussion of the Tax Receivable Agreement.  
    
  As of March 4, 2015, the Company made the necessary TRS and check-the-box elections and elected to be taxed as a REIT on its tax return for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed in September 2016.  

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
    
  Basis of Accounting and Principles of Combination and Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying combined consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the interim periods presented in this report reflects all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The interim combined consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited combined consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company s Annual Report, as certain disclosures would substantially duplicate those contained in the audited combined consolidated financial statements have not been included in this interim report. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year. The interim combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared, without audit, and do not necessarily include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair statement of our combined consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  The combined consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts and those of its subsidiaries which are majority-owned and/or controlled by the Company and variable interest entities for which the Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary, if any.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  The combined consolidated financial statements of the Company are comprised of the consolidation of LCFH and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries, prior to the IPO Transactions, and the consolidated financial statements of Ladder Capital Corp, subsequent to the IPO Transactions. 
    
  Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )   Topic 810   Consolidation   ( ASC 810 ), provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities  or  VIEs ) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIEs. Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the VIE s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the VIE that would be significant to the VIE.

     Table of Contents  

Noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are defined as  the portion of the equity (net assets) in the subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.   Noncontrolling interests are presented as a separate component of capital in the combined consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, the presentation of net income attributes earnings to shareholders/unitholders (controlling interest) and noncontrolling interests. 
    
  Emerging Growth Company Status 
    
  The Company is an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act ), and is eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies,  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  
    
  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an  emerging growth company  can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, the Company chose to  opt out  of such extended transition period, and as a result, it will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company s decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 
    
  The Company could remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years from the date of the IPO, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which its annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that the Company becomes a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of its common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (iii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the combined consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of resulting changes are reflected in the combined consolidated financial statements in the period the changes are deemed to be necessary.  Significant estimates made in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to the following: 

valuation of real estate securities; 
                
    allocation of purchase price for acquired real estate; 
                
    impairment, and useful lives, of real estate; 
                
    useful lives of intangible assets; 
                
    valuation of derivative instruments; 
                
    valuation of deferred tax asset; 
                
    amounts payable pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement; 
                
    determination of effective yield for recognition of interest income; 
                
    adequacy of provision for loan losses; 
                
    determination of other than temporary impairment of real estate securities and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures; 
                
    certain estimates and assumptions used in the accrual of incentive compensation and calculation of the fair value of equity compensation issued to employees; 
                
    determination of the effective tax rate for income tax provision; and 
                
    certain estimates and assumptions used in the allocation of revenue and expenses for our segment reporting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents  
    
  The Company considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less, at the time of acquisition, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash accounts at several financial institutions, which are insured up to a maximum of   $250,000   per account as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and at various times during the years, the balances exceeded the insured limits. 
    
  Cash Collateral Held by Broker 
    
  The Company maintains accounts with brokers to facilitate financial derivative and repurchase agreement transactions in support of its loan and securities investments and risk management activities. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, the Company may be required to deposit additional cash into these broker accounts.  The cash collateral held by broker is considered restricted cash. 
    
  Restricted Cash  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , included in other assets on the Company s combined consolidated balance sheets are   $0.4 million   and   $19.0 million  , respectively, of tenant security deposits, deposits related to real estate sales and acquisitions and required escrow balances on credit facilities, which are considered restricted cash. 
    
  Out-of-Period Adjustment 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company had recorded the following out-of-period adjustments to correct errors from prior periods: (i) additional deferred financing cost amortization of   $0.5 million   relating to 2015; (ii) additional taxes of   $1.2 million   representing additional state taxes relating to 2015 and (iii) additional return on equity of   $0.9 million   from the Company s investment in an unconsolidated joint venture predominately relating to prior years. The Company has concluded that these adjustments were not material to the financial position or results of operations for the current period or any prior periods; accordingly, the Company recorded the related adjustments in the three-month period ended March 31, 2016.  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. Additionally, this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), which amends ASU 2014-09. As a result, the effective date for the amendments contained in ASU 2014-09 will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption will use one of two retrospective application methods. The Company anticipates adopting this update in the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ). This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU 2014-09 when another party, along with the reporting entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. In these circumstances, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ), which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) Meeting (SEC Update)   ( ASU 2016-11 ), which rescinds SEC paragraphs pursuant to SEC staff announcements. These rescissions include changes to topics pertaining to accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ), which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients. The effective dates for these ASU s are the same as the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is reviewing its policies and processes to ensure compliance with the requirements in this update with regard to its operations. 
    
  In June 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-12,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2014-12 ). ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting of share-based payment awards and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes likely to be achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. ASU 2014-12 is effective for all entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. An entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either (i) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (ii) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The Company adopted this update in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 applying the amendment prospectively. The adoption has not had a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-13,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2014-13 )  .   For entities that consolidate a collateralized financing entity within the scope of this update, an option to elect to measure the financial assets and the financial liabilities of that collateralized financing entity using either the measurement alternative included in ASU 2014-13 or Topic 820 on fair value measurement is provided. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and the interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ). The guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern as well as the related required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing interim and annual financial statements, management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This evaluation should include consideration of conditions and events that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, and, if applicable, whether it is probable that management s plans to address the substantial doubt will be implemented and, if so, whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. The Company anticipates adopting this update for the year ending December 31, 2016 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ). This ASU makes changes to the VIE model and voting interest ( VOE ) model consolidation guidance. The main provisions of the ASU include the following: (i) adding a requirement that limited partnerships and similar legal entities must provide partners with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner to qualify as a VOE rather than a VIE; (ii) eliminating the presumption that the general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (iii) eliminating certain conditions that need to be met when evaluating whether fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are considered a variable interest; (iv) excluding certain fees paid to decision makers or service providers when evaluating which party is the primary beneficiary of a VIE; and (v) revising how related parties are evaluated under the VIE guidance. Lastly, the ASU eliminates the indefinite deferral of ASU 810, which allowed reporting entities with interests in certain investment funds to follow previous guidance in FIN 46 (R). However, the ASU permanently exempts reporting entities from consolidating registered money market funds that operate in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. The ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Entities may apply this ASU either using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning period of adoption or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.The Company adopted this update in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Under this ASU, the Operating Partnership is now considered a VIE, however, since the Company was previously consolidating the Operating Partnership, the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of the Company s assets, liabilities, operations and cash flows are those of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  In June 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-10,   Technical Corrections and Improvements   ( ASU 2015-10 ). The amendments in this update cover a wide range of topics in the codification and are generally categorized as follows: amendments related to differences between original guidance and the codification; guidance clarification and reference corrections; simplification and minor improvements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. As the objectives of this standard are to clarify the codification, correct unintended application of guidance, eliminate inconsistencies and to improve the codification s presentation of guidance, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost on most entities. The Company adopted this update in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU 2015-16 ). This update requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 applies to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Entities must apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of ASU 2015-16, with earlier adoption permitted for financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. The Company adopted this update in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). The update provides guidance to improve certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard is effective for a public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption by public companies for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that have not yet been made available for issuance of this guidance are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, under certain restrictions. The Company is required to apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist at the date of adoption. The Company anticipates adopting this update in the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. This update requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The ASU is expected to impact the Company s combined consolidated financial statements as the Company has certain operating lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.  
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools. The guidance also allows the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. For a public company, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ). The guidance changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The new model uses a forward-looking expected loss method, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides cash flow statement classification guidance for certain transactions, including how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. For a public company, ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its combined consolidated financial statements when adopted.

3.       MORTGAGE LOAN RECEIVABLES    
    
  September 30, 2016     ($ in thousands)

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $324.4 million   of financial assets (loans) have been treated as sales in accordance with ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing, in connection with a securitization transaction. In addition, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , of the   three   assets (loans), with a combined principal balance of   $137.6 million  ,   $61.6 million  , non-controlling, pari passu interests were also transferred as part of a securitization transaction. Since effective control continued to reside with the retained portions of the loans the transfers of any of these assets are considered nonrecourse secured borrowings in which the full loan assets remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheets in mortgage loan receivables held for investment, net, at amortized cost and the sale proceeds of   $63.2 million   are recognized in debt obligations. The Company expects to sell the retained portions of the loans in a future securitization and relinquish control. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the transfers of financial assets via sales of loans were treated as sales under ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $0.6 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, of unamortized discounts included in our mortgage loan receivables held for investment, at amortized cost, on our combined consolidated balance sheets.   
    
  The Company evaluates each of its loans for potential losses at least quarterly. Its loans are typically collateralized by real estate directly or indirectly. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at maturity, and/or (iii) the property s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the collateral property is located. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management personnel, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrowers  business plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and other market data. As a result of this analysis, the Company has concluded that   none   of its loans are individually impaired as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  However, based on the inherent risks shared among the loans as a group, it is probable that the loans had incurred an impairment due to common characteristics and inherent risks in the portfolio. Therefore, the Company has recorded a reserve, based on a targeted percentage level which it seeks to maintain over the life of the portfolio, as disclosed in the tables below. Historically, the Company has not incurred losses on any originated loans.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of the Company s loans, which were originated simultaneously as part of a single transaction, and had a carrying value of   $26.9 million  , were in default. The Company determined that   no   impairment was necessary and continues to accrue interest on these loans because the loans  collateral value was in excess of the outstanding balances. As of   September 30, 2016  , accrued but unpaid interest totaled   $2.3 million  , which includes   $1.5 million   of default interest.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   there were   no   loans on non-accrual status.

  The Company has entered into multiple committed master repurchase agreements in order to finance its lending activities. The Company has entered into   five   committed master repurchase agreements, as outlined in the   September 30, 2016   table above, totaling   $1.7 billion   of credit capacity. Assets pledged as collateral under these facilities are limited to whole mortgage loans or participation interests in mortgage loans collateralized by first liens on commercial properties and mezzanine debt. The Company also has a term master repurchase agreement with a major U.S. bank to finance CMBS totaling   $400.0 million  . The Company s repurchase facilities include covenants covering net worth requirements, minimum liquidity levels, and maximum leverage ratios. The Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The Company has the option to extend some of the current facilities subject to a number of conditions, including satisfaction of certain notice requirements, no event of default exists, and no margin deficit exists, all as defined in the repurchase facility agreements. The lenders have sole discretion with respect to the inclusion of collateral in these facilities, to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, to be exercised on a good faith basis, and have the right to require additional collateral, a full and/or partial repayment of the facilities (margin call), or a reduction in unused availability under the facilities, sufficient to rebalance the facilities if the estimated market value of the included collateral declines. 
    
  On February 19, 2015, the Company executed an amendment and extension of   one   of its credit facilities with a major banking institution, providing for, among other things, extending the maximum term of the facility to May 24, 2018, limiting the recourse exposure to the Company and modifying the pricing terms of the facility.

In connection with the execution of this new facility, the Company terminated its existing committed loan repurchase facility with total capacity of   $35.0 million  . 

40 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchase agreements with   nine   counterparties, with total debt obligations outstanding of   $1.5 billion  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   three   counterparties,   Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo  , held collateral that exceeded the amounts borrowed under the related repurchase agreements by more than   $75.0 million  , or   5%   of our total equity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average haircut, or the percent of collateral value in excess of the loan amount, under our repurchase agreements was   29.7%  . There have been no significant fluctuations in haircuts across asset classes on our repurchase facilities. 
    
  Borrowings under Credit Agreement 
    
  On January 24, 2013, the Company entered into a   $50.0 million   credit agreement with   one   of its multiple committed financing counterparties in order to finance its securities and lending activities (the  Credit Agreement ). LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the assumption or incurrence of additional liens or debt, restrictions on certain payments or transfers of assets, and restrictions on the amendment of contracts or documents related to the assets under pledge. Under the Credit Agreement, LCFH is subject to customary financial covenants relating to maximum leverage, minimum tangible net worth, and minimum liquidity consistent with our other credit facilities. The Company s ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is dependent on, among other things, LCFH s compliance with the financial covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants as of   December 31, 2015  . The Credit Agreement matured on June 23, 2016 with no further extension options. 
    
  Borrowings under Credit and Security Agreement 
    
  On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement (the  Credit and Security Agreement ) with a major banking institution to finance one of its assets in the amount of   $46.8 million   and an interest rate of   LIBOR plus 185 basis points  . On September 21, 2015, the debt was repaid, and the Credit and Security Agreement was terminated.  
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  On February 11, 2014, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which was subsequently amended on February 26, 2016 to increase its maximum funding capacity. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of   $143.0 million  , including a   $25.0 million   sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is available on a revolving basis to finance the Company s working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility has a   three  -year maturity, which may be extended by   two     12  -month periods subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is one-month LIBOR plus   3.50%   per annum payable monthly in arrears. 
    
  The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of the shares of (or other ownership or equity interests in) certain subsidiaries to the extent the pledge is not restricted under existing regulations, law or contractual obligations. 
    
  LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, restricted payments, sales of assets and affiliate transactions. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, LCFH is required to comply with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage, consistent with our other credit facilities. The Company s ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent on, among other things, LCFH s compliance with the financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, fees or other amounts, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-default to other indebtedness, the rendering of judgments against the Company or certain of our subsidiaries to pay certain amounts of money and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.

Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  As discussed in   Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies   in the Annual Report, the Company considers its committed loan master repurchase facilities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Facility to be revolving debt arrangements. As such, the Company continues to defer and present costs associated with these facilities as an asset, subsequently amortizing those costs ratably over the term of each revolving debt arrangement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of unamortized costs relating to such facilities are   $1.9 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, and are included in other assets in the combined consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Uncommitted Securities Repurchase Facilities 
    
  The Company has also entered into multiple master repurchase agreements with several counterparties collateralized by real estate securities. The borrowings under these agreements have typical advance rates between   65%   and   95%   of the fair value of collateral. 
    
  Mortgage Loan Financing 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company executed   10   and   36   term debt agreements, respectively, to finance properties in its real estate portfolio. These nonrecourse debt agreements provide for fixed rate financing at rates, ranging from   4.25%   to   6.75%  , maturing between   2018 - 2026   as of   September 30, 2016  . These loans have carrying amounts of   $575.5 million   and   $544.7 million  , net of unamortized premiums of   $5.6 million   and   $6.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, representing proceeds received upon financing greater than the contractual amounts due under these agreements. The premiums are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method. The Company recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense, for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense, for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The loans are collateralized by real estate and related lease intangibles, net, of   $746.1 million   and   $711.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Mortgage Loan Receivable Financing (Nonrecourse) 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , financial assets (loans), with a combined principal balance of   $324.4 million  , have been treated as sales in accordance with ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing, in connection with a securitization transaction. In addition, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , of the   three   assets (loans), with a combined principal balance of   $137.6 million  ,   $61.6 million  , non-controlling, pari passu interests were also transferred as part of a securitization transaction. Since effective control continued to reside with the retained portions of the loans, the transfers are considered nonrecourse secured borrowings in which the full loan assets remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheets in mortgage loan receivables held for investment, net, at amortized cost and the sale proceeds of   $63.2 million   are recognized in debt obligations. The Company expects to sell the retained portions of the loans in a future securitization and relinquish control. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the transfers of financial assets via sales of loans were treated as sales under ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing. 
    
  Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) 
    
  On July 11, 2012, Tuebor Captive Insurance Company LLC ( Tuebor ), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, became a member of the FHLB and subsequently drew its first secured funding advances from the FHLB. On March 21, 2016, Tuebor s advance limit was updated to the lowest of   $2.9 billion  ,   40%   of Tuebor s total assets or   150%   of the Company s total equity. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Tuebor had   $1.8 billion   of borrowings outstanding (with an additional   $406.3 million   of committed term financing available from the FHLB), with terms of overnight to   eight years   (with a weighted average of   2.4 years  ), interest rates of   0.38%   to   3.02%   (with a weighted average of   1.05%  ), and advance rates of   61.0%   to   95.2%   of the collateral. As of   September 30, 2016  , collateral for the borrowings was comprised of   $1.6 billion   of CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities and   $770.6 million   of first mortgage commercial real estate loans.  

42 

As of   December 31, 2015  , Tuebor had   $1.9 billion   of borrowings outstanding (with an additional   $380.4 million   of committed term financing available from the FHLB), with terms of overnight to   eight years   (with a weighted average of   1.4 years  ), interest rates of   0.28%   to   2.74%   (with a weighted average of   0.84%  ), and advance rates of   58.7%   to   95.2%   of the collateral. As of   December 31, 2015  , collateral for the borrowings was comprised of   $1.7 billion   of CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities and   $568.2 million   of first mortgage commercial real estate loans. 
    
  Tuebor is subject to state regulations which require that dividends (including dividends to the Company as its parent) may only be made with regulatory approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would obtain such approval if sought. Largely as a result of this restriction, approximately   $591.5 million   of the member s capital was restricted from transfer to Tuebor s parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Effective February 19, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the  FHFA  ), regulator of the FHLB, adopted a final rule amending its regulation regarding the eligibility of captive insurance companies for FHLB membership. According to the final rule, Ladder s captive insurance company subsidiary, Tuebor may remain as a member of the FHLB through February 19, 2021 (the  Transition Period ).  During the Transition Period, Tuebor is eligible to continue to draw new additional advances, extend the maturities of existing advances, and pay off outstanding advances on the same terms as non-captive insurance company FHLB members with the following two exceptions: 
    
           1. 
    New advances (including any existing advances that are extended during the Transition Period) will have maturity dates on or before February 19, 2021; and 
              2. 
    The FHLB will make new advances to Tuebor subject to a requirement that Tuebor s total outstanding advances do not exceed   40%   of Tuebor s total assets. 
          
  Tuebor has executed new advances since the effective date of the new rule in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  FHLB advances amounted to   40.1%   of the Company s outstanding debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not anticipate that the FHFA s final regulation will materially impact its operations as it will continue to access FHLB advances during the five-year Transition Period.  
    
  There is no assurance that the FHFA or the FHLB will not take actions that could adversely impact Tuebor s membership in the FHLB and continuing access to new or existing advances prior to February 19, 2021. 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On September 19, 2012, LCFH issued   $325.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.375%   senior notes due October 1, 2017 (the  2017 Notes ). The 2017 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on September 19, 2012. The 2017 Notes are unsecured and are subject to incurrence-based covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. On November 5, 2014, the board of directors authorized the Company to make up to   $325.0 million   in repurchases of the 2017 Notes from time to time without further approval. 
    
  On December 17, 2014, the Company retired   $5.4 million   of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of   $5.6 million   recognizing a   $0.2 million   loss on extinguishment of debt. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company retired   $21.9 million   of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of   $21.4 million  , recognizing a   $0.3 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.2) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining   $297.7 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes is due October 2, 2017. 
    
  On August 1, 2014, LCFH issued   $300.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes due August 1, 2021 (the  2021 Notes ). The 2021 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2015. The 2021 Notes will mature on August 1, 2021. The 2021 Notes are unsecured and are subject to incurrence-based covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. On February 24, 2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to make up to   $100.0 million   in repurchases of the 2021 Notes from time to time without further approval. 

43 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company retired   $33.8 million   of principal of the 2021 Notes for a repurchase price of   $28.2 million  , recognizing a   $5.1 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.4) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining   $266.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due August 1, 2021. 
    
  LCFH issued the 2021 Notes and the 2017 Notes (collectively, the  Notes ) with Ladder Capital Finance Corporation ( LCFC ), as co-issuers on a joint and several basis. LCFC is a   100%   owned finance subsidiary of Series TRS of LCFH with no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Notes. The Company and certain subsidiaries of LCFH currently guarantee the obligations under the Notes and the indenture. The Company is the general partner of LCFH and, through LCFH and its subsidiaries, operates the Ladder Capital business. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   59.5%   economic and voting interest in LCFH and controls the management of LCFH as a result of its ability to appoint board members. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of LCFH and records noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in LCFH held by the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. In addition, the Company, through certain subsidiaries which are treated as TRSs, is indirectly subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Other than the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership and federal, state and local income taxes, there are no material differences between the Company s combined consolidated financial statements and LCFH s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Beginning April 1, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 and appropriately retrospectively applied the guidance to its senior unsecured notes, to all periods presented. Unamortized debt issuance costs of   $4.6 million   are included in senior unsecured notes as of   September 30, 2016   and unamortized debt issuance costs of   $6.9 million   are included in senior unsecured notes as of   December 31, 2015   (previously included in other assets on the combined consolidated balance sheets).

(1)       Contractual payments under current maturities, some of which are subject to extensions. 
    
  The Company s debt facilities are subject to covenants which require the Company to maintain a minimum level of total equity. Largely as a result of this restriction, approximately   $899.4 million   of the total equity is restricted from payment as a dividend by the Company at   September 30, 2016  .

8.       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
    
  Fair value is based upon market quotations, broker quotations, counterparty quotations or pricing services quotations, which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications and are subject to significant variability based on market conditions, such as interest rates, credit spreads and market liquidity.  The fair value of the mortgage loan receivables held for sale is based upon a securitization model utilizing market data from recent securitization spreads and pricing. 
    
  Fair Value Summary Table 
    
  The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, which are both reported at fair value on a recurring basis (as indicated) or amortized cost/par, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows ($ in thousands):

              (3) 
    Measured at fair value on a recurring basis with the net unrealized gains or losses recorded in current period earnings. 
              (4) 
    Fair value for floating rate mortgage loan receivables, held for investment is estimated to approximate the outstanding face amount given the short interest rate reset risk (  30 days  ) and no significant change in credit risk. Fair value for fixed rate mortgage loan receivables, held for investment is measured using a hypothetical securitization model utilizing market data from recent securitization spreads and pricing. 
              (5)

    The outstanding face amount of the nonhedge derivatives represents the notional amount of the underlying contracts. 
              (8) 
    Fair value for repurchase agreement liabilities is estimated to approximate carrying amount primarily due to the short interest rate reset risk (30 days) of the financings and the high credit quality of the assets collateralizing these positions. If the collateral is determined to be impaired, the related financing would be revalued accordingly. There are no impairments on any positions. 
              (9) 
    For the mortgage loan financing, the carrying value approximates the fair value discounting the expected cash flows at current market rates.  If the collateral is determined to be impaired, the related financing would be revalued accordingly. There are no impairments on any positions.

The following table indicates the net realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on derivatives, by primary underlying risk exposure, as included in net result from derivatives transactions in the combined consolidated statements of operations for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   ($ in thousands): 

The Company s counterparties held   $30.7 million   and   $18.9 million   of cash margin as collateral for derivatives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which is included in cash collateral held by broker in the combined consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
    
  The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby, if the Company defaults on certain of its indebtedness, the Company could also be declared in default on its derivatives, resulting in an acceleration of payment under the derivatives.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was in compliance with these requirements and not in default on its indebtedness.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $6.2 million   and   $5.9 million   of cash collateral held by the derivative counterparties for these derivatives, respectively, included in cash collateral held by brokers in the combined consolidated statements of financial condition.  No additional cash would be required to be posted if the acceleration of payment under the derivatives was triggered.

10.    OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES    
    
  The following tables present both gross information and net information about derivatives and other instruments eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s accounting policy is to record derivative asset and liability positions on a gross basis, therefore, the following tables present the gross derivative asset and liability positions recorded on the balance sheets, while also disclosing the eligible amounts of financial instruments and cash collateral to the extent those amounts could offset the gross amount of derivative asset and liability positions. The actual amounts of collateral posted by or received from counterparties may be in excess than the amounts disclosed in the following tables as the following only disclose amounts eligible to be offset to the extent of the recorded gross derivative positions.

  Master netting agreements that the Company has entered into with its derivative and repurchase agreement counterparties allow for netting of the same transaction, in the same currency, on the same date.  Assets, liabilities, and collateral subject to master netting agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are disclosed in the tables above. The Company does not present its derivative and repurchase agreements net on the combined consolidated financial statements as it has elected gross presentation. 

11.     EQUITY STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTS    
    
  A description of the IPO Transactions is included in   Note 1  . In addition, a description of the distribution policies of, and accounting for, the predecessor capital structure is included later in this Note. 
    
  Subsequent to the IPO Transactions, the Company has   two   classes of common stock, Class A and Class B, which are described as follows: 
    
  Class A Common Stock 
    
  Voting Rights 
    
  Holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to   one   vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. The holders of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. 
    
  Dividend Rights 
    
  Subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be outstanding and any contractual or statutory restrictions, holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive equally and ratably, share for share, dividends as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available to pay dividends. Dividends upon Class A common stock may be declared by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of capital stock. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds available for dividends, such sums as the board of directors deems proper as reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any of the Company s property, or for any proper purpose, and the board of directors may modify or abolish any such reserve. 
    
  Liquidation Rights 
    
  Upon liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or other winding up, the holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the shareholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. 

54 

     Table of Contents  

Other Matters 
    
  The shares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or assessment by the Company. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock. All outstanding shares of Class A common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. 
    
  Allocation of Income and Loss 
    
  Income and losses are allocated among the shareholders based upon the number of shares outstanding. 
    
  Class B Common Stock 
    
  Voting Rights 
    
  Holders of shares of Class B common stock are entitled to   one   vote for each share held of record by such holder and all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law. 
    
  No Dividend or Liquidation Rights 
    
  Holders of Class B common stock do not have any right to receive dividends or to receive a distribution upon a liquidation or winding up of Ladder Capital Corp. 
    
  Exchange for Class A Common Stock 
    
  As part of the REIT Structuring Transactions described in   Note 1  , and pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement of LCFH, the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners may from time to time, subject to certain conditions, receive one share of the Company s Class A common stock in exchange for  (i) one share of the Company s Class B common stock, (ii) one Series REIT LP Unit and (iii) either one Series TRS LP Unit or one TRS Share, subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   4,135,309   Series REIT LP Units and   4,135,309   Series TRS LP Units were collectively exchanged for   4,135,309   shares of Class A common stock and   4,135,309   shares of Class B common stock were canceled. We received no other consideration in connection with these exchanges. 
    
  Stock Repurchases 
    
  On October 30, 2014, the board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   $50.0 million   of the Company s Class A common stock from time to time without further approval. Stock repurchases by the Company are generally made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices but may also be made in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   424,317   shares of Class A common stock at an average of   $10.96   per share for a total aggregate purchase price of   $4.7 million  . All repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a remaining amount available for repurchase of   $44.4 million  , which represents   5.1%   in the aggregate of its outstanding Class A common stock, based on the closing price of   13.24   per share on such date.

     Table of Contents  

The following table is a summary of the Company s repurchase activity of its Class A common stock during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   ($ in thousands): 

(1)             Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  In order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, it must annually distribute at least 90% of its taxable income and, for 2015, must distribute its undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods prior to January 1, 2015 (the  E P Distribution ). The Company made the E P Distribution on January 21, 2016 and has paid and in the future intends to declare regular quarterly distributions to its shareholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income.  
    
  Consistent with the Company s Private Letter Ruling, it may, subject to a cash/stock election by its shareholders, pay a portion of its dividends in stock, to provide for meaningful capital retention; however, the REIT distribution requirements limit its ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. The timing and amount of future distributions is based on a number of factors, including, among other things, the Company s future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition and contractual restrictions. All dividend declarations are subject to the approval of the Company s board of directors. Generally, the Company expects its distributions to be taxable as ordinary dividends to its shareholders, whether paid in cash or a combination of cash and common stock, and not as a tax-free return of capital or a capital gain. The Company believes that its significant capital resources and access to financing will provide the financial flexibility at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements, including funding new investment opportunities, paying distributions to its shareholders and servicing our debt obligations. 
    
  The following table presents dividends declared (on a per share basis) of Class A common stock for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

     Table of Contents  

Stock Dividend and Distribution of Accumulated Earnings and Profits 
    
  On   January 21, 2016  , the Company paid an aggregate of   $15.5 million   in cash to its Class A shareholders, accrued for dividends payable on unvested restricted stock of   $0.5 million   and issued   5,607,762   shares of its Class A common stock, equivalent to   $64.1 million  , in connection with both the E P Distribution and fourth quarter 2015 dividend totaling  $1.45   per share. The total number of shares of Class A common stock distributed pursuant to the E P Distribution and fourth quarter 2015 dividend was determined based on shareholder elections and the volume weighted average price of   $11.43   per share of Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the three trading days after   January 8, 2016  , the date that election forms were due. The Company also issued   4,468,031   shares of its Class B common stock and  each of Series REIT and Series TRS of LCFH issued   10,075,793   of their respective Series LP units corresponding to the aggregate number of Class A and Class B shares issued by the Company. The Company believes that the total value of its 2015 dividends was sufficient to fully distribute its 2015 taxable income and its accumulated earnings and profits.  
    
  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
    
  The following table presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the cumulative difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost basis of securities classified as available for sale for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   ($ in thousands): 

Capitalized Offering Costs 
    
  As described in   Note 1  , the Company completed an IPO of its Class A Common Stock on February 11, 2014. Costs directly attributable to the Company s IPO of   $20.5 million   were capitalized and charged against the proceeds of the IPO once completed. 
    
  Predecessor Capital Structure 
    
  The capital structure discussed below is reflective of LCFH s structure as it existed at February 11, 2014, immediately prior to the Reorganization Transactions described in   Note 1  .  Immediately following the Reorganization Transactions, with the exception of the discussions regarding quarterly tax distributions, the provisions set forth below no longer apply. 

57 

     Table of Contents  

Cash Distributions to Predecessor Partners 
    
  Distributions (other than tax distributions which are described below) will be made in the priorities described below at such times and in such amounts as determined by the Company s board of directors.  All capitalized items used in this section but not defined shall have the respective meanings given to such capitalized terms in the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Limited Partnership Agreement of LCFH dated as of August 9, 2011, as amended (the  LLLP Agreement ): 

First, to the holders of Series A and Series B participating preferred units pro rata based on the capital account of each such holder s interests, until the Series A and Series B participating preferred unit holders have each received an amount equivalent to their respective capital accounts; then  

Second,   20%   to the common unit holders, and   80%   to the holders of Series A participating preferred units, until the Series A participating preferred unit holders have each received an amount equivalent to   $124   per unit; and  

Thereafter,   20%   to common unit holders, and   80%   to the holders of Series A and Series B participating preferred units, pro rata based on the units held by each holder. 
       
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to available liquidity as determined by Company s board of directors, the Company intends to make quarterly tax distributions equal to a partner s  Quarterly Estimated Tax Amount,  which shall be computed (as more fully described in the LLLP Agreement) for each partner as the product of (x) the U.S. federal taxable income (or alternative minimum taxable income, as the case may be) allocated by the Company to such partner in respect of the partnership interests of the Company held by such partner and (y) the highest marginal blended U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate applicable to an individual residing in New York, NY, taking into account for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deductibility of state and local taxes. 
    
  Allocation of Income and Loss 
    
  Income and losses and comprehensive income are allocated among the partners in a manner to reflect as closely as possible the amount each partner would be distributed under the LLLP Agreement upon liquidation of the Operating Partnership s assets. 

12.     NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS    
    
  Pursuant to ASC 810,   Consolidation  , on the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary, changes in a parent s ownership interest (and transactions with noncontrolling interest unitholders in the subsidiary), while the parent retains its controlling interest in its subsidiary, should be accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary, with the offset to equity attributable to the parent. Accordingly, as a result of reorganization transactions which caused changes in ownership percentages between the Company s Class A shareholders and the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership that occurred during the   nine months ended      September 30, 2016  , the Company has   decreased   noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and   increased   additional paid-in capital and accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company s shareholders  equity by   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Upon the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which amended ASC 810,   Consolidation,   in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership is now determined to be a VIE, however, since the Company was previously consolidating the Operating Partnership, the adoption of ASU 2015-02 had no material impact on the Company s combined consolidated financial statements. 
    
  There are two main types of noncontrolling interest reflected in the Company s combined consolidated financial statements (i) noncontrolling interest in the operating partnership and (ii) noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures. 

58 

     Table of Contents  

Noncontrolling Interest in the Operating Partnership 
    
  As more fully described in   Note 1  , certain of the predecessor equity owners continue to own interests in the operating partnership as modified by the IPO Transactions. These interests were subsequently further modified by the REIT Structuring Transactions (also described in   Note 1  ). These interests, along with the Class B shares held by these investors, are exchangeable for Class A shares of the Company. The roll-forward of the Operating Partnership s LP Units follow the Class B common stock of the Company as disclosed in the combined consolidated statements of changes in equity.  
    
  Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest in the Operating Partnership 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to any restrictions in applicable debt financing agreements and available liquidity as determined by the board of directors of each of Series REIT of LCFH and Series TRS of LCFH, each Series must use commercially reasonable efforts to make quarterly distributions to each of its partners (including the Company) at least equal to such partner s  Quarterly Estimated Tax Amount,  which shall be computed (as more fully described in LCFH s Third Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement) for each partner as the product of (x) the U.S. federal taxable income (or alternative minimum taxable income, if higher) allocated by such Series to such partner in respect of the Series REIT LP Units and Series TRS LP Units held by such partner and (y) the highest marginal blended U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate (or alternative minimum taxable rate, as applicable) applicable to an individual residing in New York, NY, taking into account, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deductibility of state and local taxes; provided that Series TRS of LCFH may take into account, in determining the amount of tax distributions to holders of Series TRS LP Units, the amount of any distributions each such holder received from Series REIT of LCFH in excess of tax distributions. In addition, to the extent the Company requires an additional distribution from the Series of LCFH in excess of its quarterly tax distribution in order to pay its quarterly cash dividend, the Series of LCFH will be required to make a corresponding distribution of cash to each of their partners (other than the Company) on a pro-rata basis.  
    
  Allocation of Income and Loss 
    
  Income and losses and comprehensive income are allocated among the partners in a manner to reflect as closely as possible the amount each partner would be distributed under the Third Amended and Restated LLLP Agreement upon liquidation of the Operating Partnership s assets. 
    
  Noncontrolling Interest in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
    
  The Company consolidates   seven   ventures in which there are other noncontrolling investors, which own between   1.2%   -   22.5%   of such ventures. These ventures hold investments in   seven   office buildings,   one   warehouse,   one   shopping center and a condominium project. The Company makes distributions and allocates income from these ventures to the noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the respective governing agreements.

13.     EARNINGS PER SHARE    
    
  The Company s net income (loss) and weighted average shares outstanding for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   consist of the following: 

The calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share amounts for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are described and presented below. 
    
  Basic Net Income (Loss) per Share 
    
  Numerator:   utilizes net income (loss) available for Class A common shareholders for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Denominator:   utilizes the weighted average shares of Class A common stock for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share 
    
  Numerator:   utilizes net income (loss) available for Class A common shareholders for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the basic net income (loss) per share calculation described above, adding net income (loss) amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership using the as-if converted method for the Class B common shareholders while adjusting for additional corporate income tax expense (benefit) for the described net income (loss) add-back. 
    
  Denominator:   utilizes the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the basic net income (loss) per share calculation described above adding the dilutive effect of shares issuable relating to Operating Partnership exchangeable interests and the incremental shares of unvested Class A restricted stock using the treasury method. 

60 

     Table of Contents  

For the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , shares issuable relating to converted Class B common shareholders and incremental shares of unvested Class A restricted stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as the Company incurred a loss during such periods, and therefore, inclusion of such potential common shares in the calculation would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  The shares of Class B common stock do not share in the earnings of Ladder Capital Corp and are, therefore, not participating securities. Accordingly, basic and diluted net income (loss) per share of Class B common stock has not been presented, although the assumed conversion of Class B common stock has been included in the presented diluted net income (loss) per share of Class A common stock.

14.     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS    
    
  2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
    
  In connection with the IPO Transactions, the 2014 Ladder Capital Corp Omnibus Incentive Equity Plan (the  2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan ) was adopted by the board of directors on February 11, 2014, and provides certain members of management, employees and directors of the Company or its affiliates with additional incentives including grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and other cash-based awards. 
    
  2014 Restricted Stock Awards in Connection with the IPO Transactions 
    
  In connection with the IPO Transactions, restricted stock awards were granted to members of management and certain employees (the  Grantees ) with an aggregate value of   $27.5 million   which represents   1,619,865   shares of restricted Class A common stock (the  IPO Restricted Stock Awards ).   Fifty percent   of each IPO Restricted Stock Award was made subject to time-based vesting criteria, and the remaining   50%   of each IPO Restricted Stock Award was made, subject to specified performance-based vesting criteria. The time-vesting restricted stock granted to Brian Harris is scheduled to vest in   three   equal installments on each of the first   three   anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to his continued employment on the applicable vesting dates.   Twenty-five percent   of the time-vesting restricted stock granted to the other Grantees was scheduled to vest in full on the   18  -month anniversary of the date of grant, and the remaining   75%   is scheduled to vest in full on the   three  -year anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting date. The performance-vesting restricted stock is scheduled to vest in   three   equal installments on December 31 of each of 2014, 2015 and 2016, if the Company achieves a return on equity, based on Core Earnings divided by the Company s average book value of equity, equal to or greater than   8%   for such year (the  Performance Target ).  If the Company misses the Performance Target during either the first or second calendar year but meets the Performance Target for a subsequent year during the   three  -year performance period and the Company s return on equity for such subsequent year and any years for which it missed its Performance Target equals or exceeds the compounded return on equity of   8%  , based on Core Earnings divided by the Company s average book value of equity, the performance-vesting restricted stock which failed to vest because the Company previously missed its Performance Target will vest on the last day of such subsequent year. If the term  Core Earnings  is no longer used in the Company s SEC filings and approved by the compensation committee, then the Performance Target will be calculated using such other pre-tax performance measurement defined in the Company s SEC filings, as determined by the compensation committee. 
    
  The Company has elected to recognize the compensation expense related to the time-based vesting criteria for the entire award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We feel that this aligns the compensation expense with the obligation of the Company.  As such, the compensation expense related to the upfront grants to directors, officers and certain employees in connection with the IPO shall be recognized as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to Brian Harris will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years  , on an annual basis following such grant 
              2. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to directors (as described below) will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years   on an annual basis following such grant 
              3. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to officers other than Mr. Harris, and to certain employees will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years   on an annual basis following such grant. 
       
  Accruals of compensation cost for an award with a performance condition shall be based on the probable outcome of that performance condition. Therefore, compensation cost shall be accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and shall not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. 
    
  Upon termination of a Grantee s employment of service due to death or disability, and, in the case of Mr. Harris, by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Harris for Good Reason (each, as defined in the Harris Employment Agreement), the Grantee s time-vesting restricted stock will accelerate and vest in full, and the Grantee s unvested performance-vesting restricted stock will remain outstanding for the performance period and will vest to the extent the Company meets the Performance Target, including via the catch up provision described above. Upon a change in control (as defined in the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan) all restricted stock will become fully vested, if (1) the Grantee continues to be employed through the closing of the change in control or (2) after the signing of definitive documentation related to the change in control but prior to its closing, Grantee s employment is terminated without cause or due to death or disability or Grantee resigns for good reason. The compensation committee retains the right, in its sole discretion, to provide for the accelerated vesting (in whole or in part) of the restricted stock awards granted in connection with the IPO Transactions.

Peterson and Douglas Durst, who were appointed to the board of directors in connection with such transactions, received an initial restricted stock award with a grant date fair value of   $1.0 million  ,   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, which represents an aggregate of   67,648   shares of restricted Class A common stock. The grants were scheduled to vest in   three   equal installments on each of the first   three   anniversaries of the date of such grants, and each will receive an annual restricted stock award with a grant date fair value of   $50,000  , which will vest in full on the   one  -year anniversary of the date of grant, with both such awards subject to continued service on the board of directors.

  On   February 3, 2015  , restricted stock awards were granted to certain Grantees, with an aggregate value of   $0.5 million  , representing   25,742   shares of restricted Class A common stock. These restricted stock awards were allocated to the Grantees from employee forfeitures of the IPO Restricted Stock Awards and vest on the same schedule, subject to the same terms and conditions as the IPO Restricted Stock Awards described above.  
    
  The compensation expense related to the   February 3, 2015   grants will be recognized and accrued for in the same manner as the IPO Restricted Stock Awards described above.  
    
  2015 Annual Restricted Stock Awards and Annual Option Awards 
    
  Members of management are eligible to receive annual restricted stock awards (the  Annual Restricted Stock Awards ) and annual option awards (the  Annual Option Awards ) based on the performance of the Company. On     February 18, 2015  , Annual Restricted Stock Awards were granted to our executive officers (each, a  Management Grantee ) with an aggregate value of   $12.6 million   which represents   688,400   shares of restricted Class A common stock in connection with 2014 compensation.   Fifty percent   of each restricted stock award granted is subject to time-based vesting criteria, and the remaining   50%   of each restricted stock award is subject to specified performance-based vesting criteria. The time-vesting restricted stock granted to Brian Harris and the other Management Grantees will vest in three installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting dates. The performance-vesting restricted stock will vest in   three   equal installments on December 31 of each of 2015, 2016 and 2017 if the Company achieves the Performance Target for those years. If the Company misses the Performance Target during either the first or second calendar year but meets the Performance Target for a subsequent year during the   three  -year performance period and the Company s return on equity for such subsequent year and any years for which it missed its Performance Target equals or exceeds the compounded return on equity of   8%  , based on Core Earnings divided by the Company s average book value of equity, the performance-vesting restricted stock which failed to vest because the Company previously missed its Performance Target will vest on the last day of such subsequent year. If the term  Core Earnings  is no longer used in the Company s SEC filings and approved by the compensation committee, then the Performance Target will be calculated using such other pre-tax performance measurement defined in the Company s SEC filings, as determined by the compensation committee. 
    
  The Company has elected to recognize the compensation expense related to the time-based vesting criteria of the Annual Restricted Stock Awards for the entire award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  We feel that this aligns the compensation expense with the obligation of the Company.  As such, the compensation expense related to the   February 18, 2015   Annual Restricted Stock Awards to Management Grantees shall be recognized as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to Brian Harris will be expensed   1/2   each year, for   two years  , on an annual basis in advance of the Harris Retirement Eligibility Date, as defined below.  
       
           2. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to the Management Grantees other than Mr. Harris, will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years   on an annual basis following such grant.

Accruals of compensation cost for an award with a performance condition shall be based on the probable outcome of that performance condition.  Therefore, compensation cost shall be accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and shall not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. 
    
  On February 18, 2015, Annual Stock Option Awards were granted to Management Grantees with an aggregate grant date fair value of   $1.4 million  , which represents   670,256   shares of Class A common stock subject to the Annual Stock Option Awards. The stock option awards are subject to time-based vesting criteria only and vest in three equal installments on February 18 of each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, subject to continued employment until the applicable vesting date. Upon termination of a Management Grantee s employment or service due to death, disability, termination by the Company without Cause or termination by the Management Grantee for Good Reason (each, as defined in the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan), the respective Management Grantee s option awards will accelerate and vest in full. The actual grant date fair values of the Annual Option Awards granted to our Management Grantees were computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 using the Black Scholes model based on the following assumptions: (1) risk-free rate of   1.79%  ; (2) dividend yield of   5.3%  ; (3) expected life of   six   years; and (4) volatility of   24.0%  . 
    
  On   February 18, 2015  , members of the board of directors each received Annual Restricted Stock Awards with a grant date fair value of   $0.1 million  , representing   7,962   shares of restricted Class A common stock, which will vest in full on the   first   anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service on the board of directors. Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to directors will be expensed   in full   on an annual basis following such grant. 
    
  Upon a change in control (as defined in the respective award agreements), all restricted stock and option awards will become fully vested, if (1) the Management Grantee continues to be employed through the closing of the change in control or (2) after the signing of definitive documentation related to the change in control, but prior to its closing, the Management Grantee s employment is terminated without Cause or due to death or disability or the Management Grantee resigns for Good Reason. The compensation committee retains the right, in its sole discretion, to provide for the accelerated vesting (in whole or in part) of the restricted stock and option awards granted.  
    
  On February 11, 2017 (the  Harris Retirement Eligibility Date ), all outstanding Annual Restricted Stock Awards, including the time-vesting portion and the performance-vesting portion, and all outstanding Annual Option Awards granted to Mr. Harris will become fully vested, and any Annual Restricted Stock Awards and Annual Option Awards granted after the Harris Retirement Eligibility Date will be fully vested at grant. For other Management Grantees, upon the first date that is on or after February 11, 2019, where the sum of the individual s age and the individual s number of full, completed years of employment with us or our subsidiaries is equal to or greater than 60 (the  Executive Retirement Eligibility Date ), the time-vesting portion of the Annual Restricted Stock Awards and the Annual Option Awards will become fully vested, and the time-vesting portion of any Annual Restricted Stock Awards and Annual Option Awards granted after the Executive Retirement Eligibility Date will be fully vested at grant. Upon the occurrence of the Executive Retirement Eligibility Date, the performance-vesting portion of such Management Grantee s Annual Restricted Stock Awards will remain outstanding for the performance period and will vest to the extent we meet the Performance Target, including via the catch up provision described above, regardless of continued employment with us our subsidiaries following the Executive Retirement Eligibility Date. 
    
  On   June 10, 2015  , a new member of the board of directors received an Annual Restricted Stock Award with a grant date fair value of   $0.1 million  , representing   4,223   shares of restricted Class A common stock, which will vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to continued service on the board of directors. Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to the director will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years   on an annual basis following such grant. 
    
  2016 Annual Restricted Stock Awards and Annual Option Awards 
    
  On     February 18, 2016  , Annual Restricted Stock Awards were granted to Management Grantees with an aggregate value of   $9.1 million   which represents   793,598   shares of restricted Class A common stock in connection with 2015 compensation. These awards are subject to the same terms and conditions as the 2015 Annual Restricted Stock Awards, except that the relevant vesting periods begin in 2016, rather than in 2015.

The Company has elected to recognize the compensation expense related to the time-based vesting criteria of the Annual Restricted Stock Awards for the entire award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  We feel that this aligns the compensation expense with the obligation of the Company.  As such, the compensation expense related to the   February 18, 2016   Annual Restricted Stock Awards to Management Grantees shall be recognized as follows: 
    
           1. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to Brian Harris will be expensed   in full   on   February 11, 2017  , the Harris Retirement Eligibility Date. 
       
           2. 
    Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to the Management Grantees other than Mr. Harris, will be expensed   1/3   each year, for   three years   on an annual basis following such grant. 
       
  Accruals of compensation cost for an award with a performance condition shall be based on the probable outcome of that performance condition. Therefore, compensation cost shall be accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and shall not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. 
    
  On   February 18, 2016  , Annual Stock Option Awards were granted to Management Grantees with an aggregate grant date fair value of   $1.0 million  , which represents   289,326   shares of Class A common stock subject to the Annual Stock Option Awards. The stock option awards are subject to the same terms and conditions as those granted in 2015 except that the vesting period commenced in 2016. The actual grant date fair values of the Annual Option Awards granted to our Management Grantees were computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 using the Black Scholes model based on the following assumptions: (1) risk-free rate of   1.5%  ; (2) dividend yield of   9.8%  ; (3) expected life of   six   years; and (4) volatility of   48.0%  . 
    
  On   February 18, 2016  , members of the board of directors each received Annual Restricted Stock Awards with a grant date fair value of   $0.1 million  , representing   12,636   shares of restricted Class A common stock, which will vest in full on the   first   anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service on the board of directors. Compensation expense for restricted stock subject to time-based vesting criteria granted to directors will be expensed   in full   on an annual basis following such grant. These grants are subject to the same terms and conditions as those made in 2015 except that the vesting period commenced in 2016. 
    
  The 2016 awards are subject to the same change in control and retirement provisions that are described above. 
    
  The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of   $4.6 million   and   $12.7 million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $4.1 million   and   $11.3 million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  A summary of the grants is presented below ($ in thousands):

The table below presents the number of unvested shares and outstanding stock options at   September 30, 2016   and changes during   2016   of the (i) Class A Common stock and Stock Options of Ladder Capital Corp granted under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan and (ii) Series B Participating Preferred Units of LCFH granted under the 2008 Plan, which were subsequently converted to LP Units of LCFH in connection with the IPO. 

(1) 
    Converted to LP Units of LCFH on February 11, 2014 in connection with IPO and then converted to an equal number of Series REIT LP Units and Series TRS LP Units on December 31, 2014.  LCFH LP Unitholders also received an equal number of shares of Class B Common stock of the Company in connection with the conversion.  Refer to   Note 1, Organization and Operations   for further discussion of IPO and the Reorganization Transactions. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016   there was   $10.7 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to   29 months  , with a weighted-average remaining vesting period of   20.2 months  .  
    
  Phantom Equity Investment Plan 
    
  LCFH maintains a Phantom Equity Investment Plan, effective on June 30, 2011 (the  Phantom Equity Plan ) in which certain eligible employees of LCFH, LCF and their subsidiaries participate. On July 3, 2014, the Board of Directors froze the Phantom Equity Plan, as further described below. The Phantom Equity Plan is an annual deferred compensation plan pursuant to which participants could elect, or in some cases, non-management participants could be required, depending upon the participant s specific level of compensation, to defer all or a portion of their annual cash performance-based bonuses as elective or mandatory contributions. Generally, if a participant s total compensation was in excess of a certain threshold, a portion of such participant s annual bonus, was required to be deferred into the Phantom Equity Plan. Otherwise, amounts could be deferred into the Phantom Equity Plan at the election of the participant, so long as such election was timely made in accordance with the terms and procedures of the Phantom Equity Plan. 
  In the event that a participant elected to (or was required to) defer a portion of his or her compensation pursuant to the Phantom Equity Plan, such amount was not paid to the participant and was instead credited to such participant s notional account under the Phantom Equity Plan. Prior to the closing of our IPO, such amounts were invested, on a phantom basis, in the Series B Participating Preferred Units issued by LCFH until such amounts were eventually paid to the participant pursuant to the Phantom Equity Plan. Following our IPO, as described below, such amounts were invested on a phantom basis in shares of the Company s Class A common stock. Mandatory contributions are subject to one-third vesting over a three year period following the applicable Phantom Equity Plan year in which the related compensation was earned. Elective contributions were immediately vested upon contribution. Unvested amounts are generally forfeited upon the participant s involuntary termination for cause, a voluntary termination for which the participant s employer would have grounds to terminate the participant for cause or a voluntary termination within one year of which the participant obtains employment with a financial services organization.  
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

The date that the amounts deferred into the Phantom Equity Plan are paid to a participant depends upon whether such deferral is a mandatory deferral or an elective deferral. Elective deferrals are paid upon the earliest to occur of (1) a change in control (as defined in the Phantom Equity Plan), (2) the end of the participant s employment, or (3) December 31, 2017. The vested amounts of the mandatory contributions are paid upon the first to occur of (A) a change in control and (B) the first to occur of (x) December 31, 2017 or (y) the date of payment of the annual bonus payments following December 31 of the third calendar year following the applicable plan year to which the underlying deferred annual bonus relates. The Company could elect to make, and did make, payments pursuant to the Phantom Equity Plan in the form of cash in an amount equal to the then fair market value of such shares of the Company s Class A common stock (or, prior to our IPO, the Series B Participating Preferred Units), and on May 14, 2014, the Compensation Committee made a global election to make all payments pursuant to the Phantom Equity Plan in the form of cash. Mandatory contributions that were paid at the time specified in 2(B) above were made in cash.  
  Upon the closing of our IPO, each participant in the Phantom Equity Plan had his or her notional interest in LCFH s Series B Participating Preferred Units converted into a notional interest in the Company s Class A common stock, which notional conversion was based on the issuance price of our Class A common stock at the time of the IPO. On July 3, 2014, the board of directors froze the Phantom Equity Plan, effective as of such date, so that there will neither be future participants in the Phantom Equity Plan nor additional amounts contributed to any accounts outstanding under the Phantom Equity Plan. Amounts previously outstanding under the Phantom Equity Plan will be paid in accordance with their original payment terms, including limiting payment to the dates and events specified above. In connection with freezing the Phantom Equity Plan, the board of directors also updated the definition of fair market value for purposes of measuring the value of its Class A Common Stock, to provide that, generally, such value would be the closing price of such stock on the principal national securities exchange on which it is then traded.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   356,615   phantom units outstanding, of which   33,072   are unvested, resulting in a liability of   $6.5 million  , which is included in accrued expenses on the combined consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Ladder Capital Corp Deferred Compensation Plan 
    
  On July 3, 2014, the Company adopted a new, nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which was amended and restated on March 17, 2015 (the  2014 Deferred Compensation Plan ), in which certain eligible employees participate.  Pursuant to the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may elect, or in some cases non-management participants may be required, to defer all or a portion of their annual cash performance-based bonuses into the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan.  Generally, if a participant s total compensation is in excess of a certain threshold, a portion of a participant s performance-based annual bonus is required to be deferred into the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan. Otherwise, a portion of the participant s annual bonus may be deferred into the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan at the election of the participant, so long as such elections are timely made in accordance with the terms and procedures of the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan.   
    
  In the event that a participant elects to (or is required to) defer a portion of his or her compensation pursuant to the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan, such amount is not paid to the participant and is instead credited to such participant s notional account under the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan. Such amounts are then invested on a phantom basis in Class A common stock of the Company, or the phantom units, and a participant s account is credited with any dividends or other distributions received by holders of Class A common stock of the Company, which are subject to the same vesting and payment conditions as the applicable contributions. Elective contributions are immediately vested upon contribution. Mandatory contributions are subject to   one-third   vesting over a   three  -year period on a straight-line basis following the applicable year in which the related compensation was earned.  
    
  If a participant s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company other than for cause and such termination is within six months following a change in control (each, as defined in the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan), then the participant will fully vest in his or her unvested account balances. Furthermore, the unvested account balances will fully vest in the event of the participant s death, disability, retirement (as defined in the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan) or in the event of certain hostile takeovers of the board of directors of the Company.  In the event that a participant s employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, the participant will vest in the portion of the participant s account that would have vested had the participant remained employed through the end of the year in which such termination occurs, subject to, in such case or in the case of retirement, the participant s timely execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company. Unvested amounts are otherwise generally forfeited upon the participant s resignation or termination of employment, and vested mandatory contributions are generally forfeited upon the participant s termination for cause.  

67 

     Table of Contents  

Amounts deferred into the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan are paid upon the earliest to occur of (1) a change in control, (2) within   sixty   (  60  ) days following the end of the participant s employment with the Company, or (3) the date of payment of the annual bonus payments following December 31 of the third calendar year following the applicable year to which the underlying deferred annual compensation relates.  Payment is made in cash equal to the fair market value of the number of phantom units credited to a participant s account, provided that, if the participant s termination was by the Company for cause or was a voluntary resignation other than on account of such participant s retirement, the amount paid is based on the lowest fair market value of a share of Class A common stock during the forty-five day period following such termination of employment.     The amount of the final cash payment may be more or less than the amount initially deferred into the 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan, depending upon the change in the value of the Class A common stock of the Company during such period. 
    
  In February 2015, Company employees contributed   $3.4 million   to the Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   259,639   phantom units outstanding, of which   208,603   are unvested, resulting in a liability of   $3.6 million  , which is included in accrued expenses on the combined consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Bonus Payments 
    
  On   February 10, 2016  , the compensation committee of the board of directors of Ladder Capital Corp approved   2016   bonus payments to employees, including officers, totaling   $46.8 million  , which included   $10.3 million   of equity based compensation. The bonuses were accrued for as of   December 31, 2015   and paid to employees in full on   February 17, 2016  . During the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded compensation expense of   $8.3 million   and   $17.6 million  , respectively, related to   2016   bonuses. During the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded compensation expense of   $9.1 million   and   $27.1 million  , respectively, related to   2015   bonuses.  

15.    INCOME TAXES    
    
  Prior to February 11, 2014, the Company had not been subject to U.S. federal income taxes as the predecessor entity was a Limited Liability Limited Partnership ( LLLP ), but had been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax ( NYC UBT ). As a result of the IPO, a portion of the Company s income was subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes and taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates in addition to being subject to NYC UBT. Because the Company is operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2015, the Company s income will generally no longer be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes other than as described below.  
    
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries have elected to be treated as TRSs. TRSs permit the Company to participate in certain activities from which REITs are generally precluded, as long as these activities meet specific criteria, are conducted within the parameters of certain limitations established by the Code, and are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. To the extent these criteria are met, the Company will continue to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company s TRSs are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but are instead taxed as corporations. For financial reporting purposes, a provision for current and deferred taxes is established for the portion of earnings recognized by the Company with respect to its interest in TRSs. Current income tax expense (benefit) was   $8.3 million   and   $11.8 million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Current income tax expense (benefit) was   $(3.3) million   and   $5.7 million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s net deferred tax assets were   $9.8 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively, and are included in other assets in the Company s combined consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) included within the provision for income taxes was   $0.4 million   and   $(6.3) million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) included within the provision for income taxes was   $(0.8) million   and   $(1.6) million   for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a deferred tax asset of   $17.4 million   relating to capital losses which it may only use to offset capital gains. These tax attributes will expire if unused in 2020. As the realization of these assets are not more likely than not before their expiration, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset. 
    
  The Company s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities. Generally, as of   September 30, 2016  , the tax years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to taxes. The Company acquired certain corporate entities in the IPO Reorganization Transactions. The related acquisition agreements provided an indemnification to the Company by the transferor of any amounts due for any potential tax liabilities owed by these entities for tax years prior to their acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, management proposed a settlement pertaining to a New York State tax audit for these corporate entities (which are now wholly owned). As a result of the proposed settlement, management recorded income tax expense in the amount of   $3.2 million   and a corresponding payable to the State of New York. Management expects to recover such amounts paid pursuant to the indemnification and, accordingly, recorded fee and other income in the amount of   $3.2 million   as well as a corresponding receivable from the indemnity counterparty. The IRS has recently begun a routine audit of the Company s U.S. federal income tax return for tax year 2014. The Company does not expect the audit to result in any material changes to the Company s financial position.  
    
  Under U.S. GAAP, a tax benefit related to an income tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s unrecognized tax benefit is a liability for   $0.8 million   and is included in the accrued expenses in the Company s combined consolidated balance sheets. This unrecognized tax benefit, if recognized, would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not recognized any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the Company does not believe that it has any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that it will be required to record a significant liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
    
  Tax Receivable Agreement 
    
  Upon consummation of the IPO, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement the Company generally is required to pay to those Continuing LCFH Limited Partners that exchange their interests in LCFH and Class B shares of the Company for Class A shares of the Company,   85%   of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the Company realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) as a result of (i) the increase in tax basis in its proportionate share of LCFH s assets that is attributable to the Company as a result of the exchanges and (ii) payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including any tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by the Company as a result of such agreement. The Company may make future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement if the tax benefits are realized.  We would then benefit from the remaining   15%   of cash savings in income tax that we realize. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of LCFH as a result of the exchanges and had we not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
    
  Payments to a Continuing LCFH Limited Partner under the Tax Receivable Agreement are triggered by each exchange and are payable annually commencing following the Company s filing of its income tax return for the year of such exchange.  The timing of the payments may be subject to certain contingencies, including the Company having sufficient taxable income to utilize all of the tax benefits defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Company recorded a liability of   $1.9 million  , included in amount payable pursuant to tax receivable agreement in the combined consolidated balance sheets for Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. The amount and timing of any payments may vary based on a number of factors, including the absence of any material change in the relevant tax law, the Company continuing to earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits, and assuming no additional exchanges that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Depending upon the outcome of these factors, the Company may be obligated to make substantial payments pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual payment amounts may differ from these estimated amounts, as the liability will reflect changes in prevailing tax rates, the actual benefit the Company realizes on its annual income tax returns, and any additional exchanges.

     Table of Contents  

To determine the current amount of the payments due, the Company estimates the amount of the Tax Receivable Agreement payments that will be made within twelve months of the balance sheet date. As described in   Note 1   above, the Tax Receivable Agreement was amended and restated in connection with our REIT Election, effective as of December 31, 2014, in order to preserve a portion of the potential tax benefits currently existing under the Tax Receivable Agreement that would otherwise be reduced in connection with our REIT Election. The purpose of the TRA Amendment was to preserve the benefits of the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent possible in a REIT, although, as a result, the amount of payments made to the TRA Members under the TRA Amendment is expected to be less than the amount that would have been paid under the original Tax Receivable Agreement. The TRA Amendment continues to share such benefits in the same proportions and otherwise has substantially the same terms and provisions as the prior Tax Receivable Agreement. 

16.     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
    
  Commercial Real Estate Loans 
    
  From time to time, the Company may provide commercial real estate loans to entities affiliated with certain of our directors, officers or large shareholders who are, as part of their ordinary course of business, commercial real estate investors. These loans are made in the ordinary course of the Company s business on the same terms and conditions as would be offered to any other borrower of similar type and standing on a similar property.  
    
  On May 20, 2015, the Company provided a   $25.0 million  ,   9.0%   fixed rate, interest-only mezzanine loan, which matured on and was repaid in full as of June 3, 2016, to Halletts Investors LLC ( Borrower ), an entity affiliated with Douglas Durst, one of the Company s directors and chairman of The Durst Organization. The loan, which was approved by the Audit Committee and Risk and Underwriting Committee in accordance with the Company s policies regarding related party transactions, was secured by Borrower s ownership interest in Durst Halletts Member LLC ( Guarantor ). Borrower and Guarantor indirectly own a controlling interest in the three entities that collectively own approximately   9.66   acres of undeveloped land located along the East River waterfront on Hallets Point Peninsula in Astoria Queens, New York. Douglas Durst and members of his family, including trusts for which Douglas Durst is a trustee, have a controlling interest in Borrower and Guarantor. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company earned   $1.0 million   in interest income related to this loan. For the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company earned   $0.6 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, in interest income related to this loan. 
    
  Loan Referral Agreement 
    
  The Company entered into a loan referral agreement with Meridian, which, at the time, was an affiliate of a member of the Company s board of directors and an investor in the Company. The agreement provided for the payment of referral fees for loans originated pursuant to a formula based on the Company s net profit on a referred loan, as defined in the agreement, payable annually in arrears. While the arrangement gave rise to a potential conflict of interest, full disclosure was given to the borrower who, in each case, waived the conflict in writing. This agreement was cancellable by the Company based on the occurrence of certain events, or by Meridian for nonpayment of amounts due under the agreement. The Company terminated the loan referral agreement on April 2, 2014, as a result of the IPO on February 11, 2014. 
    
  The Company incurred   no   fees for the   three and     nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for loans originated in accordance with this agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.3 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, was payable to Meridian pursuant to this agreement and included in accrued expenses in the combined consolidated statements of financial condition.

  References to  Ladder,  the  Company,   Successor  and  we,   our  and  us  refer to Ladder Capital Corp, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2013, and its combined consolidated subsidiaries subsequent to the IPO and related transactions described below. These references (other than  Successor ) in periods prior to the IPO and related transactions are to Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP and subsidiaries ( LCFH  or  Predecessor ). 
    
  Ladder Capital Corp was incorporated on May 21, 2013 as a holding company for the purpose of facilitating an IPO of common equity.

  Results since inception consist of LCFH s operations from October 2008 to February 10, 2014 and Ladder Capital Corp s operations from February 11, 2014 to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are a leading commercial real estate finance company structured as an internally-managed REIT. We conduct our business through three commercial real estate-related business lines: loans, securities, and real estate investments. We believe that our in-house origination platform, ability to flexibly allocate capital among complementary product lines, credit-centric underwriting approach, access to diversified financing sources, and experienced management team position us well to deliver attractive returns on equity to our shareholders through economic and credit cycles. 
    
  Our businesses, including conduit lending, balance sheet lending, securities investments, and real estate investments, provide for a stable base of net interest and rental income. We have originated   $16.7 billion   of commercial real estate loans from our inception through   September 30, 2016  . During this timeframe, we also acquired   $9.5 billion   of investment grade-rated securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and   $1.3 billion   of selected net leased and other real estate assets.  
    
  As part of our commercial mortgage lending operations, we originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized, income producing commercial real estate properties that we intend to make available for sale in commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) securitizations. From our inception in October 2008 through   September 30, 2016  , we originated   $12.7 billion   of conduit loans,   $11.9 billion   of which were sold into   40   CMBS securitizations, making us, by volume, the second largest non-bank contributor of loans to CMBS securitizations in the United States in such period. Our sales of loans into securitizations are generally accounted for as true sales, not financings, and we generally retain no ongoing interest in loans which we securitize. The securitization of conduit loans enables us to reinvest our equity capital into new loan originations or allocate it to other investments.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6.2 billion   in total assets and   $1.5 billion   of total equity. As of that date, our assets included   $2.4 billion   of loans,   $2.7 billion   of securities, and   $825.6 million   of real estate.

We have a diversified and flexible financing strategy supporting our business operations, including significant committed term financing from leading financial institutions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $4.6 billion   of debt financing outstanding. This financing comprised   $1.8 billion   of financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the  FHLB ),   $1.0 billion   committed secured term repurchase agreement financing,   $455.4 million   of other securities financing,   $575.5 million   of third-party, non-recourse mortgage debt,   $297.7 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.375%   senior notes due October 1, 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) and   $266.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes  and, collectively with the 2017 Notes, the  Notes ). There were   $100.0 million   of borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.5 billion   of committed, undrawn funding capacity available, consisting of   $43.0 million   of availability under our   $143.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility,   $406.3 million   of undrawn committed FHLB financing and   $1.0 billion   of other undrawn committed financings. As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt-to-equity ratio was   3.1  :1.0, as we employ leverage prudently to maximize financial flexibility. 
    
  Ladder was founded in October 2008. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were capitalized by public investors, our management team and a group of leading global institutional investors, including affiliates of Alberta Investment Management Corp., GI Partners, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and TowerBrook Capital Partners. We have built our business to include   65   full-time industry professionals. 
    
  We are led by a disciplined and highly aligned management team. As of   September 30, 2016  , our management team and directors held interests in our Company comprising   11.9%   of our total equity. On average, our management team members have   28   years of experience in the industry. Our management team includes Brian Harris, Chief Executive Officer; Michael Mazzei, President; Pamela McCormack, Chief Operating Officer; Marc Fox, Chief Financial Officer; Thomas Harney, Head of Merchant Banking   Capital Markets; and Robert Perelman, Head of Asset Management. Additional officers of Ladder include Kelly Porcella, General Counsel and Secretary, and Kevin Moclair, Chief Accounting Officer. 
    
  We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to shareholders if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income and comply with certain other requirements.

Our Businesses 
    
  We invest primarily in loans, securities and other interests in U.S. commercial real estate, with a focus on senior secured assets. Our complementary business segments are designed to provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically allocate capital in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns under varying market conditions. The following table summarizes the value of our investment portfolio as reported in our combined consolidated financial statements as of the dates indicated below ($ in thousands):   

We invest in the following types of assets: 
    
  Loans 
    
  Conduit First Mortgage Loans.    We originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans that are secured by cash-flowing commercial real estate and are available for sale to securitizations. These first mortgage loans are typically structured with fixed interest rates and generally have five- to ten-year terms. Our loans are directly originated by an internal team that has longstanding and strong relationships with borrowers and mortgage brokers throughout the United States. We follow a rigorous investment process, which begins with an initial due diligence review; continues through a comprehensive legal and underwriting process incorporating multiple internal and external checks and balances; and culminates in approval or disapproval of each prospective investment by our Investment Committee. Conduit first mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million also require approval of our board of directors  Risk and Underwriting Committee. 

79 

     Table of Contents  

Although our primary intent is to sell our conduit first mortgage loans to CMBS trusts, we generally seek to maintain the flexibility to keep them on our balance sheet or otherwise sell them as whole loans to third-party institutional investors. From our inception in 2008 through   September 30, 2016  , we have originated and funded   $12.7 billion   of conduit first mortgage loans and securitized   $11.9 billion   of such mortgage loans in   40   separate transactions, including   two   securitizations in   2010  ,   three   securitizations in   2011  ,   six   securitizations in   2012  ,   six   securitizations in   2013  ,   10   securitizations in   2014  ,   10   securitizations in   2015   and   three   securitizations in   2016  . We generally securitize our loans together with certain financial institutions, which to date have included affiliates of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and we have also completed two single-asset securitizations. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , conduit first mortgage loans remained on our balance sheet for a weighted average of   127   and   62   days prior to securitization, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   33   first mortgage loans that were substantially available for contribution into a securitization with an aggregate book value of   $784.2 million  . Based on the loan balances and the  as-is  third-party Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ( FIRREA ) appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan- to-value ratio of this portfolio was   65.6%   at   September 30, 2016  . The Company holds these conduit loans in its TRS. 
    
  Balance Sheet First Mortgage Loans.    We also originate and invest in balance sheet first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties that are undergoing transition, including lease-up, sell-out, and renovation or repositioning. These mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the property owners, and generally have LIBOR based floating rates and terms (including extension options) ranging from one to five years. Balance sheet first mortgage loans are originated, underwritten, approved and funded using the same comprehensive legal and underwriting approach, process and personnel used to originate our conduit first mortgage loans. Balance sheet first mortgage loans in excess of $20.0 million also require the approval of our board of directors  Risk and Underwriting Committee. 
    
  We generally seek to hold our balance sheet first mortgage loans for investment. These investments have been typically repaid at or prior to maturity (including by being refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization). As of   September 30, 2016  , we held a portfolio of   69   balance sheet first mortgage loans with an aggregate book value of   $1.5 billion  . Based on the loan balances and the  as-is  third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of this portfolio was   66.6%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other Commercial Real Estate-Related Loans.    We selectively invest in note purchase financings, subordinated debt, mezzanine debt and other structured finance products related to commercial real estate that are generally held for investment. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held a portfolio of   36   other commercial real estate-related loans with an aggregate book value of   $169.2 million  . Based on the loan balance and the  as-is  third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the portfolio was   74.2%   at   September 30, 2016  .

Securities 
    
  CMBS Investments.    We invest in CMBS secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and own predominantly AAA-rated securities. These investments provide a stable and attractive base of net interest income and help us manage our liquidity. We have significant in-house expertise in the evaluation and trading of CMBS, due in part to our experience in originating and underwriting mortgage loans that comprise assets within CMBS trusts, as well as our experience in structuring CMBS transactions. AAA-rated CMBS investments in excess of $50 million and all other securities positions in excess of $26.0 million require the approval of our board of directors  Risk and Underwriting Committee. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of our portfolio of CMBS investments totaled   $2.6 billion   in   199   CUSIPs (  $13.0 million   average investment per CUSIP). As of that date,   97.7%   of our CMBS investments were rated investment grade by Standard   Poor s Ratings Group, Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Inc., consisting of   84.1%   AAA/Aaa-rated securities and   13.6%   of other investment grade-rated securities, including   11.6%   rated AA/Aa,   1.2%   rated A/A and   0.7%   rated BBB/Baa. In the future, we may invest in CMBS securities or other securities that are unrated. As of   September 30, 2016  , our CMBS investments had a weighted average duration of   3.1   years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of   September 30, 2016  , by property count and market value, respectively,   49.8%   and   68.3%   of the collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio was distributed throughout the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas ( MSAs ) in the United States, with   4.1%   and   31.2%   of the collateral located in the New York-Newark-Edison MSA, and the concentrations in each of the remaining top 24 MSAs ranging from   0.3%   to   8.2%   by property count and   0.1%   to   10.5%   by market value. 
    
  U.S. Agency Securities Investments.    Our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio consists of securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as GNMA, or by a government-sponsored enterprise ( GSE ), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (  Freddie Mac ). In addition, these securities are secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate. As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of our portfolio of U.S. Agency Securities was   $62.2 million   in   31   CUSIPs (  $2.0 million   average investment per CUSIP), with a weighted average duration of   8.0   years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of   September 30, 2016  , by market value   67.2%  ,   15.7%  , and   5.2%   of the collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities, excluding the collateral underlying our Agency interest-only securities, was located in   New York  ,   California  , and   Georgia  , respectively, with no other state having a concentration greater than 10.0%. By property count,   California   represented   59.5%  ,   Georgia   represented   13.5%   and   New York   represented   5.4%   of such collateral. While the specific geographic concentration of our Agency interest-only securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   is not obtainable, risk relating to any such possible concentration is mitigated by the interest payments of these securities being guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a GSE. 
    
  Real Estate 
    
  Commercial Real Estate Properties.    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   112   single tenant net leased properties with an aggregate book value of   $538.8 million  .

Other Investments 
    
  Institutional Bridge Loan Partnership.    In 2011, we established LCRIP I, an institutional partnership, with a Canadian sovereign pension fund to invest in first mortgage bridge loans that meet predefined criteria. Our partner owns 90% of the limited partnership interest, and we own the remaining   10%   on a pari passu basis and act as general partner. We retain discretion over which loans to present to LCRIP I, and our partner retains the discretion to accept or reject individual loans. As the general partner, we have engaged our advisory entity to manage the assets of LCRIP I and earn management fees and incentive fees from LCRIP I. In addition, we are entitled to retain origination fees of up to 1% on loans that we sell to LCRIP I and on a case-by-case basis as approved by our partner, may retain certain exit fees. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the last loan held by LCRIP I was repaid. The term of the partnership expired on April 15, 2016. At that time, LCRIP I made distributions to the partners in the aggregate amounts determined by the general partner in accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
    
  Unconsolidated Joint Venture.    In connection with the origination of a loan in April 2012, we received a   25%   equity kicker with the right to convert upon a capital event. On March 22, 2013, we refinanced the loan, and we converted our equity kicker interest into a   25%   limited liability company membership interest in Grace Lake LLC. As of   September 30, 2016  , Grace Lake LLC owned an office building campus with a carrying value of   $63.1 million  , which is net of accumulated depreciation of   $18.7 million  , that is financed by   $72.0 million   of long-term debt. Debt of Grace Lake LLC is nonrecourse to the limited liability company members, except for customary nonrecourse carve-outs for certain actions and environmental liability. As of   September 30, 2016  , the book value of our investment in Grace Lake LLC was   $3.5 million  . 
    
  Unconsolidated Joint Venture.    On   August 7, 2015  , the Company entered into a joint venture, 24 Second Avenue, with an operating partner to invest in a ground-up condominium construction and development project located at 24 Second Avenue, New York, NY. The Company contributed   $31.1 million   for a   73.8%   interest, with the operating partner holding the remaining   26.2%   interest. The Company is entitled to income allocations and distributions based upon its membership interest of   73.8%   until the Company achieves a 1.70x profit multiple, after which, ultimately, income is allocated and distributed 50% to the Company and 50% to the operating partner. As of   September 30, 2016  , the book value of our investment in 24 Second Avenue was   $30.4 million  . 
    
  FHLB Stock.   Tuebor is a member of the FHLB.

Members may need to purchase additional stock to comply with these capital requirements from time to time. FHLB stock is redeemable by Tuebor upon five years  prior written notice, subject to certain restrictions and limitations. Under certain conditions, the FHLB may also, at its sole discretion, repurchase FHLB stock from its members. 
    
  Our Financing Strategies 
    
  Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our financing to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties. 
    
  We fund our investments in commercial real estate loans and securities through multiple sources, including the $611.6 million of gross cash proceeds we raised in our initial equity private placement beginning in October 2008, the $257.4 million of gross cash proceeds we raised in our follow-on equity private placement in the third quarter of 2011, proceeds from the issuance of $325.0 million of 2017 Notes in 2012, the   $238.5 million   of net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in 2014, proceeds from the issuance of $300.0 million of 2021 Notes in 2014, current and future earnings and cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities, and other borrowing programs in which we participate. 
    
  We finance our portfolio of commercial real estate loans using committed term facilities provided by multiple financial institutions, with total commitments of   $1.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a   $143.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility and through our FHLB membership. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $622.6 million   outstanding under the committed term facilities. We finance our securities portfolio, including CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities, through our FHLB membership, a   $400.0 million   committed term master repurchase agreement from a leading domestic financial institution and uncommitted master repurchase agreements with numerous counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total outstanding balances of   $835.7 million   under all securities master repurchase agreements. We finance our real estate investments with nonrecourse first mortgage loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding balances of   $575.5 million   on these nonrecourse mortgage loans.  

86 

     Table of Contents  

In addition to the amounts outstanding on our other facilities, we had   $1.8 billion   of borrowings from the FHLB outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we also had a   $143.0 million   Revolving Credit Facility, with   $100.0 million   borrowings outstanding, and   $563.9 million   of Notes issued and outstanding. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources  and   Note 7, Debt Obligations   in our combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this   Quarterly   Report for more information about our financing arrangements. 
    
  We enter into interest rate and credit spread derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. We generally seek to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly-originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in our CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio. We monitor our asset profile and our hedge positions to manage our interest rate and credit spread exposures, and we seek to match fund our assets according to the liquidity characteristics and expected holding periods of our assets. 
    
  We generally seek to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3.0:1.0 or below. We expect this ratio to fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year due to the normal course of business in our conduit lending operations, in which we generally securitize our inventory of conduit loans at intervals, and also because of changes in our asset mix, due in part to such securitizations. As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt-to-equity ratio was   3.1  :1.0. We believe that our predominantly senior secured assets and our moderate leverage provide financial flexibility to be able to capitalize on attractive market opportunities as they arise. 
    
  From time to time, we may add financing counterparties that we believe will complement our business, although the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Our amended and restated charter and by-laws do not impose any threshold limits on our ability to use leverage. 
    
  Business Outlook 
    
  We believe the commercial real estate finance market is currently characterized by relatively stable property values, large volumes of maturing loans and a low interest rate environment. According to Trepp, more than $1.7 trillion of commercial real estate debt is scheduled to mature over the next five years. In contrast to these positive factors, certain areas of the CMBS markets saw rapid spread widening versus Treasury swaps in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016. We believe the market disruptions experienced earlier this year were caused by domestic and international macro-market factors rather than underlying fundamental issues within the commercial real estate sector. The overall tone of the CMBS market turned more positive in the third quarter of 2016 and the market experienced corresponding credit-spread tightening. However, new Dodd-Frank regulations are set to go into effect in December of 2016, which may affect CMBS pricing and liquidity conditions. See Item 1A.  Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Portfolio Our participation in the market for mortgage loan securitizations may expose us to risks that could result in losses to us  in the Annual Report. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, new CMBS issuance totaled $49.0 billion, a 36.9% decrease versus the same period in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, new CMBS issuance totaled $101.0 billion, a 7.4% increase over the same period in 2014. Although increased competition from non-CMBS lenders, such as life insurance companies and banks, has been evident over the past few quarters and CMBS volumes have been affected by market volatility and uncertainty related to the effects of the pending regulatory changes, we believe the CMBS market will continue to play an important role in the financing of commercial real estate in the U.S. 
    
  We believe our ability to quickly and efficiently rotate our focus between lending, investing in securities, and making real estate equity investments allows us to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities under a variety of market conditions. When the conduit lending and securitization market conditions are favorable, we are capable of shifting our focus and equity allocation toward that market. At other times, especially when conduit lending and securitization market conditions are disrupted, investment in securities and our other products can be more attractive and we are able to shift our focus and investment allocation accordingly. 
    
  Factors impacting operating results 
    
  There are a number of factors that influence our operating results in a meaningful way. The most significant factors include: (1) our competition; (2) market and economic conditions; (3) loan origination volume; (4) profitability of securitizations; (5) avoidance of credit losses; (6) availability of debt and equity funding and the costs of that funding; (7) the net interest margin on our investments; and (8) effectiveness of our hedging and other risk management practices.

Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Investment overview 
    
  Investment activity in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   focused on loan originations and securities activity. We originated and funded   $845.5 million   in principal value of commercial mortgage loans in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . We acquired   $322.8 million   of new securities, which was offset by   $178.8 million   of sales and   $172.2 million   of amortization in the portfolio, which partially contributed to a net   decrease   in our securities portfolio of   $49.3 million  . We also invested   $34.2 million   in real estate and received proceeds from the sale of real estate of   $16.4 million  . 
    
  Investment activity in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   focused on loan originations and securities activity. We originated and funded   $836.1 million   in principal value of commercial mortgage loans in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We acquired   $208.6 million   of new securities, which was offset by   $62.0 million   of sales and   $27.8 million   of amortization in the portfolio, which partially contributed to a net increase in our securities portfolio of $116.0 million. We also invested   $26.5 million   in real estate. 
    
  Operating overview 
    
  Net income attributable to Class A common shareholders totaled   $27.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The most significant drivers of the   $24.3 million     increase   are as follows: 

an increase   in total other income of   $61.8 million  , primarily as a result of a   $51.6 million     increase   in net results from derivative transactions,   an increase   of   $6.6 million   in gain (loss) on securities and   an increase   of   $4.4 million   in sale of loans; 

a decrease   in total costs and expenses of   $1.6 million   compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of a   $1.0 million     decrease   in real estate operating expenses and a   $0.6 million   decrease in operating expenses; 

a decrease   in net interest income of   $3.9 million  , primarily as a result of an increase of lower yielding mortgage loans receivable, available for sale, a decrease in higher yielding subordinated debt and mezzanine debt and a decrease in the weighted average coupon on mortgage loans receivable, available for sale portfolio year-over-year; and 

an increase   in income tax expense (benefit) of   $12.9 million   compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased income in our TRSs and certain other one-time adjustments. 
       
  Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled   $44.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $41.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The significant components of the   $3.3 million     increase   in Core Earnings are   an increase   in profits on gain (loss) on securities of   $6.6 million  ,   an increase   in profits on sales of loans, net of   $4.8 million  , partially offset by the   decrease   in net results from derivative transactions of   $5.2 million  ,   a decrease   in net interest income of   $3.9 million   and the   decrease   of total costs and expenses discussed in the preceding paragraph. See   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.   
    
  Net interest income 
    
  Interest income totaled   $60.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $63.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $2.7 million     decrease   in interest income was primarily attributable to the lower weighted average yield on new loans originated compared to the higher weighted average yield on loans that were securitized or paid off.  
    
  Interest expense totaled   $30.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $1.2 million     increase   in interest expense was primarily attributable to the   increase   in average mortgage loan financing balance required to finance the expanded real estate portfolio. Our interest expense also includes interest expense related to mortgage loan financing against our real estate investments. For the three months ended    September 30, 2016  , our mortgage loan financing balance averaged   $551.3 million   versus an average mortgage loan financing balance of   $517.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Net interest income after provision for loan losses totaled   $29.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $33.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $3.7 million     decrease   in net interest income after provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to the   decrease   in net interest income and   increase   in interest expense discussed above and the increase in debt obligations. 
    
  Cost of funds, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled   $39.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $36.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $3.3 million     increase   in cost of funds was primarily attributable to the extension of FHLB borrowings at higher interest rates and an increase in hedging losses. 
    
  We present cost of funds, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the Company s cost of debt financing. We define cost of funds as interest expense as reported on our combined consolidated statements of income adjusted to include the net interest expense component resulting from our hedging activities, which is currently included in net results from derivative transactions on our combined consolidated statements of income. See   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for our definition of cost of funds and a reconciliation to interest expense. 
    
  Interest spreads 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average yield on our mortgage loan receivables was   6.2%  , compared to   7.1%   as of   September 30, 2015   as the weighted average yield on new loans originated was lower than the weighted average yield on loans that were securitized or paid off. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on borrowings against our mortgage loan receivables was   2.1%  , compared to   2.3%   as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings secured by our mortgage loan receivables equal to   46.0%   of the carrying value of our mortgage loan receivables, compared to   45.4%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average yield on our real estate securities was   2.9%  , compared to   2.8%   as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on borrowings against our real estate securities was   1.2%  , compared to   0.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in the rate on borrowings against our real estate securities from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to higher prevailing market borrowing rates as of   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings secured by our real estate securities equal to   82.5%   of the carrying value of our real estate securities, compared to   84.1%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Our real estate is comprised of non-interest bearing assets; however, interest incurred on mortgage financing collateralized by such real estate is included in interest expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on mortgage borrowings against our real estate was   4.8%  , compared to   4.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings secured by our real estate equal to   69.7%   of the carrying value of our real estate, compared to   66.1%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Provision for loan losses 
    
  We had   no   provision for loan losses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We originate and invest primarily in loans with high credit quality, and we sell our conduit loans in the ordinary course of business. We estimate our loan loss provision based on our historical loss experience and our expectation of losses inherent in the investment portfolio but not yet realized. To ensure that the risk exposures are properly measured and the appropriate reserves are taken, the Company assesses a loan loss provision balance that will grow over time with its portfolio and the related risk as the assets approach maturity and ultimate refinancing where applicable. As a result, we determined that   no   provision for loan losses was required for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of the Company s loans, which were originated simultaneously as part of a single transaction, with a carrying value of   $26.9 million   were in default. The Company determined that   no   impairment was necessary due to the property s liquidation value and continues to accrue interest on these loans.

Operating overview 
    
  Net income (loss) attributable to Class A common shareholders totaled   $24.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $46.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The most significant drivers of the   $21.8 million     decrease   are as follows: 

a decrease   in total other income (loss) of   $54.9 million  , primarily as a result of   a decrease   of   $29.4 million   in sales of loans, net,   a decrease   of   $14.2 million   in realized gains on securities, a   $11.5 million     decrease   in net results from derivative transactions and a   $5.7 million     decrease   in profits on sale of real estate, partially offset by   an increase   of   $5.4 million   in gain on extinguishment of debt and a   $6.4 million     increase   in fee income; and 

a decrease   in total costs and expenses of   $16.6 million   compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced incentive compensation expense due to reduced total net interest income after provision for loan losses and total other income ( Net Revenues ) and loan/investment production. See   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for a definition of Net Revenues and a reconciliation to total net interest income after provision for loan losses and total other income. 
       
  Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled   $113.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $141.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The significant components of the   $27.7 million     decrease   in Core Earnings are   a decrease   in total other income (loss) of   $40.5 million  , primarily as a result of   a decrease   of   $31.2 million   in sale of loans, net,   a decrease   of   $14.2 million   in gain (loss) on securities, partially offset by   an increase   of   $8.5 million   in net results from derivative transactions and   a decrease   in total costs and expenses of   $20.5 million   primarily as a result of reduced incentive compensation expense due to reduced total Net Revenues and loan/investment production discussed in the preceding paragraph.

The   $2.9 million     decrease   in interest income was primarily attributable to the lower weighted average yield on new loans originated compared to the higher weighted average yield on loans that were securitized or paid off. 
    
  Interest expense totaled   $88.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $83.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   $4.8 million     increase   in interest expense was primarily attributable to the   increase   in average mortgage loan financing balance that is required to finance the expanded real estate portfolio. Our interest expense also includes interest expense related to mortgage loan financing against our real estate investments. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our mortgage loan financing balance averaged   $544.9 million   versus an average mortgage loan financing balance of   $502.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

The   $7.6 million     decrease   in net interest income after provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to the   decrease   in net interest income,   increase   in interest expense discussed above and increase in debt obligations. 
    
  Cost of funds, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled   $111.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $104.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   $7.7 million     increase   in cost of funds was primarily attributable to higher prevailing market borrowing costs. See   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for our definition of cost of funds and a reconciliation to interest expense.

The   increase   in the rate on borrowings against our real estate securities from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to higher prevailing market borrowing rates as of   September 30, 2016   versus   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings secured by our real estate securities equal to   82.5%   of the carrying value of our real estate securities, compared to   84.1%   as of   September 30, 2015  .

     Provision for loan losses 
    
  We had a   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million   provision for loan losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We invest primarily in loans with high credit quality, and we sell our conduit loans in the ordinary course of business. We estimate our loan loss provision based on our historical loss experience and our expectation of losses inherent in the investment portfolio but not yet realized. To ensure that the risk exposures are properly measured and the appropriate reserves are taken, the Company assesses a loan loss provision balance that will grow over time with its portfolio and the related risk as the assets approach maturity and ultimate refinancing where applicable. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of the Company s loans, which were originated simultaneously as part of a single transaction, with a carrying value of   $26.9 million   were in default. The Company determined that   no   impairment was necessary due to the property s liquidation value and continues to accrue interest on these loans.

  Income from sale of loans, net, which includes all loan sales, whether by securitization, whole loan sales or other means, totaled   $30.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $59.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $29.4 million  . In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we participated in   three   separate securitization transactions, selling   60   loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $664.1 million  . In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we participated in   seven   separate securitization transactions, selling   153   loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of   $2.0 billion  . Income from sales of loans, net is subject to market conditions impacting timing, size and pricing and as such may vary significantly quarter to quarter.

  Realized gain (loss) on securities totaled   $9.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $23.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   of   $14.2 million  . Other than temporary impairment on U.S. Agency Securities, which is included in realized gain (loss) on securities totaled   $(0.6) million   of that decrease. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   $308.4 million   of securities, comprised of   $307.2 million   of CMBS and   $1.2 million   U.S. Agency Securities. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold   $789.0 million   of securities, comprised of   $772.8 million   of CMBS and   $16.2 million   U.S. Agency Securities. The   decrease   in sales of securities reflects   lower   transaction volume and lower profit margins in   2016   as compared to   2015  . 
    
  Unrealized gain (loss) on Agency interest-only securities 
    
  Unrealized gain (loss) on Agency interest-only securities represented a   gain   of   $28,780   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a   loss   of   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   positive   change of   $0.6 million   in unrealized gain (loss) on Agency interest-only securities was due to an increase in interest rates and amortization and sales of the portfolio during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Income from sales of real estate, net 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , income from sales of real estate, net totaled   $15.6 million  , compared to   $21.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $5.7 million   was a result of the commercial real estate and residential condominium sales discussed below.  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   two   single-tenant retail property resulting in a net gain on sale of   $1.2 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold   four   single-tenant retail properties resulting in a net gain on sale of   $2.6 million  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , income from sales of residential condominiums totaled   $14.4 million  . We sold   58   residential condominium units from Veer Towers in Las Vegas, NV, resulting in a net gain on sale of   $11.0 million  , and   49   residential condominium units from Terrazas River Park Village in Miami, FL, resulting in a net gain on sale of   $3.4 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , income from sales of residential condominiums totaled   $18.4 million  . We sold   72   residential condominium units from Veer Towers in Las Vegas, NV, resulting in a net gain on sale of   $13.4 million  , and   74   residential condominium units from Terrazas River Park Village in Miami, FL, resulting in a net gain on sale of   $5.0 million  . 
    
  Fee and other income 
    
  Fee and other income totaled   $17.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We generated fee income from origination fees, exit fees and other fees on the loans we originate and in which we invest, HOA fees, dividend income on our investment in FHLB stock and the management of our institutional partnership and our managed account, both of which were terminated during 2015. The   $6.4 million     increase   in fee and other income year-over-year was primarily due to a $3.2 million receivable from an indemnity counterparty, which is more fully discussed in   Note 15, Income Taxes  , an increase in exit fees, HOA fee income and dividend income on our investment in FHLB stock, partially offset by a decrease in management fees from our institutional partnership and our managed account and lower origination fees due to lower origination volume in   2016  . 
    
  Net result from derivative transactions 
    
  Net result from derivative transactions represented a   loss   of   $66.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which was comprised of an unrealized   loss   of   $6.2 million   and a realized   loss   of   $59.9 million  , compared to a   loss   of   $54.6 million   which was comprised of an unrealized   loss   of   $8.4 million   and a realized   loss   of   $46.2 million  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , a   negative   change of   $11.5 million  . The derivative positions that generated these results were a combination of interest rate swaps, caps, and futures that we employed in an effort to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of our fixed rate assets and the net interest income we earn against the impact of changes in interest rates. The loss in   2016   was primarily related to movement in interest rates during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The total net result from derivative transactions is comprised of hedging interest expense, realized gains/losses related to hedge terminations and unrealized gains/losses related to changes in the fair value of asset hedges. The hedge positions were related to fixed rate conduit loans and securities investments.

Earnings from our investment in LCRIP I totaled   $0.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $0.8 million   reflects recognition of final incentive fee earned from our investment in LCRIP I in   2016  . LCRIP I held no loans as of   September 30, 2016  , as the last loan held by LCRIP I was repaid during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The term of LCRIP I expired on April 15, 2016. At that time, LCRIP I made distributions to the partners in the aggregate amounts determined by the general partner in accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. Earnings from our investment in Grace Lake JV totaled   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Earnings (loss) from our investment in 24 Second Avenue totaled   $(1.1) million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $(0.2) million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We made our investment in 24 Second Avenue on August 7, 2015 and incurred   $1.1 million   and   $0.2 million   in upfront development costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt 
    
  Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt totaled   $5.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   none   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company retired   $21.9 million   of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of   $21.4 million  , recognizing a   $0.3 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.2) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt, and the Company retired   $33.8 million   of principal of the 2021 Notes for a repurchase price of   $28.2 million  , recognizing a   $5.1 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.4) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. 
    
  Salaries and employee benefits 
    
  Salaries and employee benefits totaled   $43.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $47.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Salaries and employee benefits are comprised primarily of salaries, bonuses, originator bonuses related to loan profitability, equity based compensation and other employee benefits. The   decrease   of   $4.0 million   in compensation expense was attributable to the   decrease   in incentive compensation expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to reduced actual Net Revenues and loan/investment production in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Operating expenses 
    
  Operating expenses totaled   $15.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $20.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Operating expenses are primarily composed of professional fees, lease expense, and technology expenses. The   decrease   of   $5.1 million   represents REIT transaction costs incurred in   2015   and cost cutting initiatives in   2016  . 
    
  Real estate operating expenses 
    
  Real estate operating expenses totaled   $22.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $28.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $5.4 million   in real estate operating expense was in part due to the sale of office and residential real estate in   2015   and   2016  .  
    
  Real estate acquisition costs 
    
  There were   $0.6 million   of real estate acquisition costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of   $0.9 million   in real estate acquisition costs was due to   $50.3 million   of real estate acquisitions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $166.8 million   of real estate acquisitions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Fee expense 
    
  Fee expense totaled   $2.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Fee expense is comprised primarily of custodian fees, financing costs and servicing fees related to loans. The   decrease   of   $0.9 million   in fee expense was primarily attributable to the   decrease   in the balance of our mortgage loan receivables held for investment, net, at amortized cost at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization totaled   $28.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   $0.4 million     decrease   in depreciation and amortization is attributable to the sale of an office property in 2015, partially offset by a partial period of depreciation on   2016   acquisitions and a full period of depreciation on acquisitions made in   2015  . 
    
  Income tax (benefit) expense 
    
  Most of our consolidated income tax provision relates to the business units held in our TRSs. Income tax (benefit) expense totaled   $5.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $1.4 million   is primarily attributable to increased income in our TRSs.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our financing to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple capital markets and counterparties. 
    
  We require substantial amounts of capital to support our business. The management team, in consultation with our board of directors, establishes our overall liquidity and capital allocation strategies. A key objective of those strategies is to support the execution of our business strategy while maintaining sufficient ongoing liquidity throughout the business cycle to service our financial obligations as they become due. When making funding and capital allocation decisions, members of our senior management consider business performance; the availability of, and costs and benefits associated with, different funding sources; current and expected capital markets and general economic conditions; our balance sheet and capital structure; and our targeted liquidity profile and risks relating to our funding needs. 
    
  Our primary uses of liquidity are for (1) the funding of loan and real estate-related investments, (2) the repayment of short-term and long-term borrowings and related interest, (3) the funding of our operating expenses and (4) distributions to our equity investors to comply with the REIT distribution requirements and the terms of LCFH s LLLP Agreement. We require short-term liquidity to fund loans that we originate and hold on our combined consolidated balance sheet pending sale, including through whole loan sale, participation, or securitization. We generally require longer-term funding to finance the loans and real estate-related investments that we hold for investment. 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity have been (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) cash generated from operations, (3) borrowings under repurchase agreements, (4) principal repayments on investments including mortgage loans and securities, (5) borrowings under our credit agreement, (6) borrowings under our revolving credit facility, (7) proceeds from securitizations and sales of loans, (8) proceeds from the sale of securities, (9) proceeds from the sale of real estate, (10) proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, and (11) proceeds from the issuance of equity capital. As a REIT, we will also be required to make sufficient dividend payments to our shareholders (and equivalent distributions to the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners) in amounts at least sufficient to maintain out REIT status. We have obtained the Private Letter Ruling, pursuant to which we may elect to pay a portion of our dividends in stock, subject to a cash/stock election by our shareholders, to optimize our level of capital retention.  
    
  We generally seek to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3.0:1.0 or below. This ratio typically fluctuates during the course of a fiscal year due to the normal course of business in our conduit lending operations, in which we generally securitize our inventory of loans at intervals, and also because of changes in our asset mix, due in part to such securitizations. We generally seek to match fund our assets according to their liquidity characteristics and expected hold period. We believe that the defensive positioning of our predominantly senior secured assets and our financing strategy has allowed us to maintain financial flexibility to capitalize on an attractive range of market opportunities as they have arisen.

We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future. However, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt in the indentures governing the Notes (the  Indentures ) and our other debt agreements. Under the Indentures, we may not incur certain types of indebtedness unless our consolidated debt to equity ratio (as defined in the Indentures) is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 and our consolidated non-funding debt to equity ratio (as defined in the Indentures) is less than or equal to 1.75 to 1.00, although our subsidiaries are permitted to incur indebtedness where recourse is limited to the assets and/or the general credit of such subsidiary. Our borrowings under certain financing agreements and our committed loan facilities are subject to maximum consolidated leverage ratio limits (currently ranging from 3.50 to 1.00 to 4.00 to 1.00), including maximum consolidated leverage ratio limits weighted by asset composition that change based on our asset base at the time of determination, and, in the case of one provider, a minimum interest coverage ratio requirement of 1.50 to 1.00 if certain liquidity thresholds are not satisfied. These restrictions, which would permit us to incur substantial additional debt, are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. 
    
  Our principal debt financing sources include: (1) committed secured funding provided by banks, (2) uncommitted secured funding sources, including asset repurchase agreements with a number of banks, (3) long term nonrecourse mortgage financing, (4) long term senior unsecured notes in the form of corporate bonds and (5) borrowings on both a short- and long-term committed basis, made by Tuebor from the FHLB. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $59.7 million  , unencumbered loans of   $552.9 million   and unencumbered securities of   $90.3 million  . 
    
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute at least 90% of our taxable income. Consistent with the terms of the Private Letter Ruling, we paid our fourth quarter 2015 dividend in a combination of cash and stock and may pay future distributions in such a manner; however, the REIT distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. We believe that our significant capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements, including funding new investment opportunities, paying distributions to our shareholders and servicing our debt obligations. 
    
  Our captive insurance company subsidiary, Tuebor, is subject to state regulations which require that dividends may only be made with regulatory approval. Largely as a result of this restriction,   $591.5 million   of Tuebor s member s capital was restricted from transfer to Tuebor s parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company established a broker-dealer subsidiary, LCS, which was initially licensed and capitalized to do business in July 2010. LCS is required to be compliant with FINRA and SEC regulations, which require that dividends may only be made with regulatory approval. Largely as a result of this restriction,   $1.2 million   of LCS s member s capital was restricted from transfer to LCS s parent without prior approval of regulators at   September 30, 2016  . 
     
  Cash and cash equivalents 
    
  We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $59.7 million   and   $109.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Cash generated from (used in) operations 
    
  Our operating activities were a net provider (user) of cash of   $(138.7) million   and   $206.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash from operations includes the origination of loans held for sale, net of the proceeds from sale of loans and gains from sales of loans.

Borrowings under various financing arrangements 
    
  Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. We manage our leverage policies to complement our asset composition and to diversify our exposure across multiple counterparties. Our borrowings under various financing arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are set forth in the table below ($ in thousands): 

The Company s repurchase facilities include covenants covering minimum net worth requirements (ranging from $100.0 million to   $899.4 million  ), maximum reductions in net worth over stated time periods, minimum liquidity levels (typically $30.0 million of cash or a higher standard that often allows for the inclusion of different percentages of liquid securities in the determination of compliance with the requirement), maximum leverage ratios (calculated in various ways based on specified definitions of indebtedness and net worth) and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25x, and, in the instance of one provider, an interest coverage ratio of 1.50x, in each case, if certain liquidity thresholds are not satisfied. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Further, certain of our financing arrangements and loans on our real property are secured by the assets of the Company, including pledges of the equity of certain subsidiaries or the assets of certain subsidiaries. From time to time, certain of these financing arrangements and loans may prohibit certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends to the Company, from making distributions on such subsidiary s capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary s property or other assets to the Company or other subsidiaries of the Company. 
    
  Committed loan facilities 
    
  We are parties to multiple committed loan repurchase agreement facilities, totaling   $1.7 billion   of credit capacity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $622.6 million   of borrowings outstanding, with an additional   $1.0 billion   of committed financing available. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $704.1 million   of borrowings outstanding, with an additional   $780.9 million   of committed financing available. Assets pledged as collateral under these facilities are generally limited to whole mortgage loans collateralized by first liens on commercial real estate. Our repurchase facilities include covenants covering net worth requirements, minimum liquidity levels, and maximum debt/equity ratios. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  We have the option to extend some of our existing facilities subject to a number of customary conditions. The lenders have sole discretion with respect to the inclusion of collateral in these facilities, to determine the market value of the collateral on a daily basis, and, if the estimated market value of the included collateral declines, the lenders have the right to require additional collateral or a full and/or partial repayment of the facilities (margin call), sufficient to rebalance the facilities. Typically, the facilities are established with stated guidelines regarding the maximum percentage of the collateral asset s market value that can be borrowed. We often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset s value than the maximum leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon at a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis.

Committed securities facility 
    
  We are a party to a term master repurchase agreement with a major U.S. banking institution for CMBS, totaling   $400.0 million   of credit capacity. As we do in the case of borrowings under committed loan facilities, we often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset s value than the maximum leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $380.3 million   of borrowings outstanding, with an additional   $19.7 million   of committed financing available. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $161.9 million   of borrowings outstanding, with an additional   $138.1 million   of committed financing available. 
    
  Uncommitted securities facilities 
    
  We are party to multiple master repurchase agreements with several counterparties to finance our investments in CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities. The securities that served as collateral for these borrowings are highly liquid and marketable assets that are typically of relatively short duration. As we do in the case of other secured borrowings, we often borrow at a lower percentage of the collateral asset s value than the maximum leaving us with excess borrowing capacity that can be drawn upon a later date and/or applied against future margin calls so that they can be satisfied on a cashless basis. 
    
  Collateralized borrowings under repurchase agreement 
    
  The following table presents the amount of collateralized borrowings outstanding as of the end of each quarter, the average amount of collateralized borrowings outstanding during the quarter and the monthly maximum amount of collateralized borrowings outstanding during the quarter ($ in thousands): 

(1)   
    Collateralized borrowings under repurchase agreements include all securities and loan financing under repurchase agreements. 
              (2)   
    Other collateralized borrowings include borrowings under credit agreement and borrowings under credit and security agreement. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchase agreements with   nine   counterparties, with total debt obligations outstanding of   $1.5 billion  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   three   counterparties,   Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo  , held collateral that exceeded the amounts borrowed under the related repurchase agreements by more than   $75.0 million  , or 5% of our total equity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average haircut, or the percent of collateral value in excess of the loan amount, under our repurchase agreements was   29.7%  . There have been no significant fluctuations in haircuts across asset classes on our repurchase facilities.

Borrowings under Credit Agreement 
    
  On January 24, 2013, we entered into a   $50.0 million   credit agreement with one of our committed financing counterparties in order to finance our securities and lending activities. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under this facility. The Credit Agreement matured on June 23, 2016 with no further extension options. 
    
  LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the assumption or incurrence of additional liens or debt, restrictions on certain payments or transfers of assets, and restrictions on the amendment of contracts or documents related to the assets under pledge. Under the credit agreement, LCFH is subject to customary financial covenants relating to maximum leverage, minimum tangible net worth, and minimum liquidity consistent with our other credit facilities. Our ability to borrow under this credit agreement will be dependent on, among other things, LCFH s compliance with the financial covenants. 
    
  Borrowings under Credit and Security Agreement 
    
  On October 31, 2014, we entered into a credit and security agreement with a major banking institution to finance one of our assets in the amount of   $46.8 million   and an interest rate of   LIBOR plus 185 basis points  . On September 21, 2015, the debt was repaid, and the credit and security agreement was terminated.  
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  On February 11, 2014, we entered into a revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which was subsequently amended on February 26, 2016 to increase its maximum funding capacity. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing amount of   $143.0 million  , including a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $100.0 million   borrowings outstanding under this facility. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   borrowings outstanding under this facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is available on a revolving basis to finance the Company s working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility has a three-year maturity, which may be extended by two 12-month periods subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of default. Interest is incurred on the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum payable monthly in arrears. 
    
  The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of the shares of (or other ownership or equity interests in) certain subsidiaries to the extent the pledge is not restricted under existing regulations, law or contractual obligations. 
    
  LCFH is subject to customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, restricted payments, sales of assets and affiliate transactions under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, under the Revolving Credit Facility, LCFH is required to comply with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, maximum leverage, minimum liquidity, and minimum fixed charge coverage, consistent with our other credit facilities. Our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility will be dependent on, among other things, LCFH s compliance with the financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, fees or other amounts, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-default to other indebtedness, the rendering of judgments against the Company or certain of our subsidiaries to pay certain amounts of money and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. 
    
  Mortgage loan financing 
    
  We generally finance our real estate using long-term nonrecourse mortgage financing. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we executed   ten   term debt agreements to finance real estate. These nonrecourse debt agreements are fixed rate financing at rates ranging from   4.25%   to   6.75%  , maturing between   2018 - 2026   and totaling   $575.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $544.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . These long-term nonrecourse mortgages include net unamortized premiums of   $5.6 million   and   $6.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, representing proceeds received upon financing greater than the contractual amounts due under the agreements. The premiums are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective interest method. We recorded   $0.7 million   and   $0.7 million   of premium amortization, which decreased interest expense, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The loans are collateralized by real estate and related lease intangibles, net, of   $746.1 million   and   $711.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Mortgage Loan Receivable Financing (Nonrecourse) 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , financial assets (loans), with a combined principal balance of   $324.4 million  , have been treated as sales in accordance with ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing, in connection with a securitization transaction. In addition, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , of the   three   assets (loans), with a combined principal balance of   $137.6 million  ,   $61.6 million  , non-controlling, pari passu interests were also transferred as part of a securitization transaction. Since effective control continued to reside with the retained portions of the loans, the transfers are considered nonrecourse secured borrowings in which the full loan assets remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheets in mortgage loan receivables held for investment, net, at amortized cost and the sale proceeds of   $63.2 million   are recognized in debt obligations. The Company expects to sell the retained portions of the loans in a future securitization and relinquish control. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the transfers of financial assets via sales of loans were treated as sales under ASC Topic 860       Transfers and Servicing. 
    
  FHLB financing 
    
  On July 11, 2012, Tuebor Captive Insurance Company LLC ( Tuebor ) became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ). As of   September 30, 2016  , Tuebor had   $1.8 billion   of borrowings outstanding (with an additional   $406.3 million   of committed term financing available from the FHLB), with terms of overnight to   8 years  , interest rates of   0.38%   to   3.02%  , and advance rates of   61.0%   to   95.2%   of the collateral. As of   September 30, 2016  , collateral for the borrowings was comprised of   $1.6 billion   of CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities and   $770.6 million   of first mortgage commercial real estate loans. On March 21, 2016, Tuebor s advance limit was updated to the lowest of   $2.9 billion  ,   40%   of Tuebor s total assets or   150%   of Ladder Capital Corp s total equity. As of   December 31, 2015  , Tuebor had   $1.9 billion   of borrowings outstanding (with an additional   $380.4 million   of committed term financing available from the FHLB), with terms of overnight to   8 years  , interest rates of   0.28%   to   2.74%  , and advance rates of   58.7%   to   95.2%   of the collateral. As of   December 31, 2015  , collateral for the borrowings was comprised of   $1.7 billion   of CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities and   $568.2 million   of first mortgage commercial real estate loans. 
    
  Effective February 19, 2016, the FHFA, regulator of the FHLB, adopted a final rule amending its regulation regarding the eligibility of captive insurance companies for FHLB membership. 
  Pursuant to the final rule, Tuebor may remain a member of the FHLB through February 19, 2021 (the  Transition Period ). During the Transition Period, Tuebor is eligible to continue to draw new additional advances, extend the maturities of existing advances, and pay off outstanding advances on the same terms as non-captive insurance company FHLB members with the following two exceptions: 
           1) 
    New advances (including any existing advances that are extended during the Transition Period) will have maturity dates on or before February 19, 2021; and 
              2) 
    The FHLB will make new advances to Tuebor subject to a requirement that Tuebor s total outstanding advances do not exceed 40% of Tuebor s total assets.  
       
  Tuebor has executed new advances since the effective date of the new rule in the ordinary course of business.  
    
  FHLB advances amounted to   40.1%   of the Company s outstanding debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not anticipate that the FHFA s final regulation will materially impact its operations as it will continue to access FHLB advances during the five-year Transition Period and it has multiple, diverse funding sources for financing its portfolio in the future. In the latter stages of the five-year Transition Period, the Company expects to adjust its financing activities by gradually making greater use of alternative sources of funding of types currently used by the Company including secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other counterparties, the issuance of corporate bonds and equity, and the securitization or sale of assets. Future moves to alternative funding sources could result in higher or lower advance rates from secured funding sources but also the incurrence of higher funding and operating costs than would have been incurred had FHLB funding continued to be available. In addition, the Company may find it more difficult to obtain committed secured funding for multiple year terms as it has been able to obtain from the FHLB.  
    
  The Transition Period allows time for events to occur that may impact Tuebor s long-term membership in the FHLB, including further regulatory changes, the enactment of legislation, or the filing of litigation challenging the validity of the final rule. During this period, a combination of these external events and/or Tuebor s own actions could result in the emergence of feasible alternative approaches for it to retain its FHLB membership.

There is no assurance that the FHFA or the FHLB will not take actions that could adversely impact Tuebor s membership in the FHLB and continuing access to new or existing advances prior to February 19, 2021. 
    
  Tuebor is subject to state regulations which require that dividends (including dividends to the Company as its parent) may only be made with regulatory approval. However, there can be no assurance that we would obtain such approval if sought. Largely as a result of this restriction,   $591.5 million   of the member s capital was restricted from transfer to Tuebor s parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
    
  On September 19, 2012, LCFH issued   $325.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.375%   Senior Notes due October 1, 2017 (the  2017 Notes ). The 2017 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on September 19, 2012. The 2017 Notes are unsecured and are subject to incurrence-based covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. On November 5, 2014, the board of directors authorized the Company to make up to $325.0 million in repurchases of the 2017 Notes from time to time without further approval. 
    
  On December 17, 2014, the Company retired   $5.4 million   of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of   $5.6 million   recognizing a   $0.2 million   loss on extinguishment of debt. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company retired   $21.9 million   of principal of the 2017 Notes for a repurchase price of   $21.4 million   recognizing a   $0.3 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.2) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining   $297.7 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes is due October 2, 2017. 
    
  On August 1, 2014, LCFH issued   $300.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes due August 1, 2021 (the  2021 Notes ). The 2021 Notes require interest payments semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2015. The 2021 Notes will mature on August 1, 2021. The 2021 Notes are unsecured and are subject to incurrence-based covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. On February 24, 2016, the board of director authorized the Company to make up to $100.0 million in repurchases of the 2021 Notes from time to time without further approval. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company retired   $33.8 million   of principal of the 2021 Notes for a repurchase price of   $28.2 million  , recognizing a   $5.1 million   net gain on extinguishment of debt after recognizing   $(0.4) million   of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt. The remaining   $266.2 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes is due August 1, 2021. 
    
  LCFH issued the 2021 Notes and the 2017 Notes (collectively, the  Notes ) with Ladder Capital Finance Corporation ( LCFC ), as co-issuers on a joint and several basis. LCFC is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of LCFH with no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Notes. The Company and certain subsidiaries of LCFH currently guarantee the obligations under the Notes and the indenture. The Company is the general partner of LCFH and, through LCFH and its subsidiaries, operates the Ladder Capital business. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   59.5%   economic and voting interest in LCFH and controls the management of LCFH as a result of its ability to appoint board members. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of LCFH and records noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in LCFH held by the Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. In addition, the Company, through certain subsidiaries that are treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a  TRS ), is indirectly subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Other than the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership and federal, state and local income taxes, there are no material differences between the Company s combined consolidated financial statements and LCFH s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Beginning April 1, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 and appropriately retrospectively applied the guidance to its senior unsecured notes, to all periods presented. Unamortized debt issuance costs of   $4.6 million  , were included in senior unsecured notes as of   September 30, 2016   and unamortized debt issuance costs of   $6.9 million  , were included in senior unsecured notes as of   December 31, 2015   (previously included in other assets on the combined consolidated balance sheets).

Stock Repurchases 
    
  On October 30, 2014, the board of directors authorized the Company to make up to   $50.0 million   in repurchases of the Company s Class A common stock from time to time without further approval. Stock repurchases by the Company are generally made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices but may also be made in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a remaining amount available for repurchase of   $44.4 million  , which represents   5.1%   in the aggregate of its outstanding Class A common stock, based on the closing price of   $13.24   per share on such date. 
    
  The following table is a summary of our repurchase activity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   ($ in thousands): 

(1)             Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must annually distribute at least 90% of our taxable income and, for 2015, we must distribute our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods prior to January 1, 2015 (the  E P Distribution ). The Company made the E P Distribution on January 21, 2016 and has paid and in the future intend to declare regular quarterly distributions to our shareholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income.  
    
  Consistent with the Private Letter Ruling we may, subject to a cash/stock election by our shareholders, pay a portion of our dividends in stock, to provide for meaningful capital retention; however, the REIT distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. The timing and amount of future distributions is based on a number of factors, including, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition and contractual restrictions. All dividend declarations are subject to the approval of our board of directors. Generally, we expect the distributions to be taxable as ordinary dividends to our shareholders, whether paid in cash or a combination of cash and common stock, and not as a tax-free return of capital or a capital gain. We believe that our significant capital resources and access to financing will provide the financial flexibility at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements, including funding new investment opportunities, paying distributions to our shareholders and servicing our debt obligations.

Principal repayments on investments 
    
  We receive principal amortization on our loans and securities as part of the normal course of our business. Repayment of mortgage loan receivables provided net cash of   $583.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $576.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Repayment of real estate securities provided net cash of   $307.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $142.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Proceeds from securitizations and sales of loans 
    
  We sell our conduit mortgage loans to securitization trusts and to other third parties as part of our normal course of business. Proceeds from sales of mortgage loans provided net cash of   $703.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $1.9 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Proceeds from the sale of securities 
    
  We invest in CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities. Proceeds from sales of securities provided net cash of   $308.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $789.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Proceeds from the sale of real estate 
    
  We own a portfolio of commercial real estate properties as well as residential condominium units. Proceeds from sales of real estate provided net cash of   $54.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $84.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Proceeds from the issuance of equity 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   proceeds realized in connection with the issuance of equity. We may issue additional equity in the future. 
    
  Other potential sources of financing 
    
  In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our assets, including credit facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase facilities and other secured and unsecured forms of borrowing. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized, may involve one or more lenders and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. We may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments.

Contractual obligations 
    
  Contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows ($ in thousands): 

(1)          Composed of interest on secured financings and on senior unsecured notes. For borrowings with variable interest rates, we used the rates in effect as of   September 30, 2016   to determine the future interest payment obligations. 
  (2)          Comprised of our off-balance sheet unfunded commitment to provide additional first mortgage loan financing as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The tables above do not include amounts due under our derivative agreements as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments.  Our contractual obligations will be refinanced and/or repaid from earnings as well as amortization and sales of our liquid collateral. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have made investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures. See   Note 6, Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures   for further details of our unconsolidated investments. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments. 
    
  Unfunded Loan Commitments 
    
  We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our borrowers. As of   September 30, 2016  , our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of   $88.0 million   of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment, which was composed of   $86.6 million   to provide additional first mortgage loan financing and   $1.4 million   to provide additional mezzanine loan financing. As of   December 31, 2015  , our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of   $112.8 million   of unfunded commitments of mortgage loan receivables held for investment, which was comprised of   $111.4 million   to provide additional first mortgage loan financing and   $1.4 million   to provide additional mezzanine loan financing. Such commitments are subject to our borrowers  satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the combined consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected on our combined consolidated balance sheets.

  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Core Earnings 
    
  We present Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe Core Earnings assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-cash expenses and unrecognized results from derivatives and Agency interest-only securities, which we believe makes comparisons across reporting periods more relevant by eliminating timing differences related to changes in the values of assets and derivatives. In addition, we use Core Earnings: (i) to evaluate our earnings from operations and (ii) because management believes that it may be a useful performance measure for us. Core Earnings is also used as a factor in determining the annual incentive compensation of our senior managers and other employees. 
    
  We consider the Class A common shareholders of the Company and Continuing LCFH Limited Partners to have fundamentally equivalent interests in our pre-tax earnings. Accordingly, for purposes of computing Core Earnings we start with pre-tax earnings and adjust for other noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures but we do not adjust for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. 
    
  We define Core Earnings as income before taxes adjusted to exclude: (i) real estate depreciation and amortization; (ii) the impact of derivative gains and losses related to the hedging of assets on our balance sheet as of the end of the specified accounting period; (iii) unrealized gains/(losses) related to our investments in Agency interest-only securities; (iv) the premium (discount) on mortgage loan financing and the related amortization of premium (discount) on mortgage loan financing recorded during the period; (v) non-cash stock-based compensation; and (vi) certain one-time transactional items. 
    
  As discussed in   Note 2   to the combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this   Quarterly   Report, we do not designate derivatives as hedges to qualify for hedge accounting and therefore any net payments under, or fluctuations in the fair value of, our derivatives are recognized currently in our income statement. However, fluctuations in the fair value of the related assets are not included in our income statement. We consider the gain or loss on our hedging positions related to assets that we still own as of the reporting date to be  open hedging positions.  While recognized for GAAP purposes, we exclude the results on the hedges from Core Earnings until the related asset is sold and the hedge position is considered  closed,  whereupon they would then be included in Core Earnings in that period. These are reflected as  Adjustments for unrecognized derivative results  for purposes of computing Core Earnings for the period. 
    
  As more fully discussed in   Note 2   to the combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this   Quarterly   Report, our investments in Agency interest-only securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. We believe that excluding these specifically identified gains and losses associated with the open hedging positions adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize changes in the fair values of our assets and derivatives which we use to hedge asset values.

GAAP gains/losses on sales of real estate include the effects of previously recognized real estate depreciation and amortization. For purposes of Core Earnings, our share of real estate depreciation and amortization is eliminated and, accordingly, the resultant gain/losses must also be adjusted.

    As more fully discussed in Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded an additional $3.2 million income tax expense for a proposed tax settlement for pre-acquisition liabilities on certain corporate entities acquired in the IPO Reorganization Transactions. The Company also recorded other income of $3.2 million relating to the expected recovery of these amounts pursuant to indemnification. While these items are presented on a gross basis, there was no impact to either net income or Core Earnings. Accordingly, since pre-tax income excludes the tax effect but includes the recovery of $3.2 million pursuant to the indemnification, the recovery amount has been excluded from Core Earnings.   

(5) 
    One-time transactional adjustment for costs related to restructuring the Company for REIT related operations. All costs were expensed and accrued for in the period incurred. 

Core Earnings has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: 

Core Earnings does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations and is not necessarily indicative of cash necessary to fund cash needs; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate Core Earnings differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
       
  Because of these limitations, Core Earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or any other performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity. 
    
  In the future we may incur gains and losses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Core Earnings should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging 
    
  We present income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the performance of our loan securitization business. Income from sales of securitized loans, net is a key component of our results. Since our loans sold into securitizations to date are comprised of long-term fixed-rate loans, the result of hedging those exposures prior to securitization represents a substantial portion of our interest rate hedging. Therefore, we view these two components of our profitability together when assessing the performance of this business activity and find it a meaningful measure of the Company s performance as a whole. When evaluating the performance of our sale of loans into securitization business, we generally consider the income from sales of securitized loans, net, in conjunction with other income statement items that are directly related to such securitization transactions, including portions of the realized net result from derivative transactions that are specifically related to hedges on the securitized or sold loans, which we reflect as hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the table below. 
    
  Set forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of income from sale of securitized loans, net to income from sale of loans, net as reported in our combined consolidated financial statements included herein and an unaudited reconciliation of hedge gain/(loss) relating to loans securitized to net results from derivative transactions as reported in our combined consolidated financial statements included herein ($ in thousands except for number of loans and securitizations):

Cost of funds 
    
  We present cost of funds, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the Company s cost of debt financing. We define cost of funds as interest expense as reported on our combined consolidated statements of income adjusted to include the net interest expense component resulting from our hedging activities, which is currently included in net results from derivative transactions on our combined consolidated statements of income. Interest income, net of cost of funds, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as interest income, less cost of funds.

Net Revenues 
    
  We present Net Revenues, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the Company s performance, excluding operating expenses. We define Net Revenues as net interest income after provision for loan losses and total other income, which are both disclosed on the Company s combined consolidated statements of income. We present interest income on investments, net and income from sales of loans, net as a percent of Net Revenues to determine the impact of the net interest from our investments and the securitization activity on our Net Revenues ($ in thousands).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The nature of the Company s business exposes it to market risk arising from changes in interest rates. Changes, both increases and decreases, in the rates the Company is able to charge its borrowers, the yields the Company is able to achieve in its securities investments, and the Company s cost of borrowing directly impacts its net income. The Company s interest income stream from loans and securities is generally fixed over the life of its assets, whereas it uses floating-rate debt to finance a significant portion of its investments. Another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets the Company acquires. The Company faces the risk that the market value of its assets will increase or decrease at different rates than that of its liabilities, including its hedging instruments. The Company mitigates interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap and futures agreements. Interest rate swap and futures agreements are utilized to hedge against future interest rate increases on the Company s borrowings and potential adverse changes in the value of certain assets that result from interest rate changes. The Company generally seeks to hedge assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in the Company s CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of its U.S. Agency Securities portfolio. 
    
  The following table summarizes the change in net income for a 12-month period commencing   September 30, 2016   and the change in fair value of our investments and indebtedness assuming an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the LIBOR interest rate on   September 30, 2016  , both adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities ($ in thousands): 

(1) 
    Subject to limits for floors on our floating rate investments and indebtedness. 
       
  Market Value Risk 
    
  The Company s securities investments are reflected at their estimated fair value. The change in estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in estimated fair value of Agency interest-only securities is recorded in current period earnings. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the market value of the Company s assets may be adversely impacted. The Company s fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio is subject to the same risks. However, to the extent those loans are classified as held for sale, they are reflected at the lower of cost or market. Otherwise, held for investment mortgage loans are reflected at values equal to the unpaid principal balances net of certain fees, costs and loan loss allowances.

     Table of Contents  

Liquidity Risk 
    
  Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which the Company invests and may at the same time lead to a significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in liquidity of real estate and real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability of observable transaction data and inputs, may make it more difficult to sell the Company s investments or determine their fair values. As a result, the Company may be unable to sell its investments, or only be able to sell its investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in such conditions, there is no guarantee that the Company s borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. In addition, a decline in market value of the Company s assets may have particular adverse consequences in instances where it borrowed money based on the fair value of its assets. A decrease in the market value of the Company s assets may result in the lender requiring it to post additional collateral or otherwise sell assets at a time when it may not be in the Company s best interest to do so. The Company s captive insurance company subsidiary, Tuebor, is subject to state regulations which require that dividends may only be made with regulatory approval. The Company s broker-dealer subsidiary, LCS, is also required to be compliant with FINRA and SEC regulations which require that dividends may only be made with regulatory approval. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  The Company is subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with its investments. The Company seeks to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analyses of potential assets and through ongoing asset management. The Company s investment guidelines do not limit the amount of its equity that may be invested in any type of its assets; however, investments greater than a certain size are subject to approval by the Risk and Underwriting Committee of the board of directors. 
    
  Credit Spread Risk 
    
  Credit spread risk is the risk that interest rate spreads between two different financial instruments will change. In general, fixed-rate commercial mortgages and CMBS are priced based on a spread to Treasury or interest rate swaps. The Company generally benefits if credit spreads narrow during the time that it holds a portfolio of mortgage loans or CMBS investments, and the Company may experience losses if credit spreads widen during the time that it holds a portfolio of mortgage loans or CMBS investments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to changes in credit spreads and the Company may enter into credit total return swaps or take positions in other credit related derivative instruments to moderate its exposure against losses associated with a widening of credit spreads. 
    
  Risks Related to Real Estate 
    
  Real estate and real estate-related assets, including loans and commercial real estate-related securities, are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; environmental conditions; competition from comparable property types or properties; changes in tenant mix or performance and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause the Company to suffer losses. 
    
  Covenant Risk 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into loan and securities repurchase agreements and credit facilities with certain lenders to finance its real estate investment transactions. These agreements contain, among other conditions, events of default and various covenants and representations. If such events are not cured by the Company or waived by the lenders, the lenders may decide to curtail or limit extension of credit, and the Company may be forced to repay its advances or loans. In addition, the Company s Notes are subject to covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, restricted payments, liens, sales of assets, affiliate transactions and other covenants typical for financings of this type. The Company s failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which could result in the Company being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants. 

114 

     Table of Contents  

Diversification Risk 
    
  The assets of the Company are concentrated in the real estate sector. Accordingly, the investment portfolio of the Company may be subject to more rapid change in value than would be the case if the Company were to maintain a wide diversification among investments or industry sectors. Furthermore, even within the real estate sector, the investment portfolio may be relatively concentrated in terms of geography and type of real estate investment. This lack of diversification may subject the investments of the Company to more rapid change in value than would be the case if the assets of the Company were more widely diversified. 
    
  Concentrations of Market Risk 
    
  Concentrations of market risk may exist with respect to the Company s investments. Market risk is a potential loss the Company may incur as a result of change in the fair values of its investments. The Company may also be subject to risk associated with concentrations of investments in geographic regions and industries. 
    
  Regulatory Risk 
    
  The Company established a broker-dealer subsidiary, Ladder Capital Securities LLC, which was initially licensed and capitalized to do business in July 2010. LCS is required to be compliant with FINRA and SEC requirements on an ongoing basis and is subject to multiple operating and reporting requirements to which all broker-dealer entities are subject. Additionally, Ladder Capital Asset Management LLC (formerly Ladder Capital Adviser LLC) (the  Adviser ) is a registered investment adviser. The Adviser is required to be compliant with SEC requirements on an ongoing basis and is subject to multiple operating and reporting requirements to which all registered investment advisers are subject. In addition, Tuebor is subject to state regulation as a captive insurance company. If LCS, the Adviser or Tuebor fail to comply with regulatory requirements, they could be subject to loss of their licenses and registration and/or economic penalties. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of   September 30, 2016  , to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. Further, certain of our subsidiaries, including our registered broker-dealer, registered investment advisers and captive insurance company, are subject to scrutiny by government regulators, which could result in enforcement proceedings or litigation related to regulatory compliance matters. We are not presently a party to any material enforcement proceedings, litigation related to regulatory compliance matters or any other type of material litigation matters. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate, based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no material changes during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   to the risk factors in Item 1A in our Annual Report. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sale of Securities 
    
  None. 
    
  Stock Repurchases 
    
  On October 30, 2014, our board of directors authorized the Company to make up to   $50.0 million   in repurchases of the Company s Class A common stock from time to time without further approval. Stock repurchases by the Company are generally made in open market transactions at prevailing market prices but may also be made in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and amount of purchases are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no repurchases of Class A common stock by the Company.  

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
    
  None.
