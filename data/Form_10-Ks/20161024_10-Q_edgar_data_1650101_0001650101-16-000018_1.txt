The accompanying interim financial statements of
Addentax Group Corp. (the  Company ), have been prepared without audit pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted principles have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.   

In the opinion of management, the financial statements
contain all material adjustments, consisting only of normal adjustments
considered necessary to present fairly the financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented.

ORGANIZATION
  AND NATURE OF BUSINESS   

Addentax
Group Corp. ( the Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was incorporated in Nevada on
October 28, 2014, and the Company is engaged in the field of producing images
on multiple surfaces using heat transfer technology.  

Note
  2.   

GOING
  CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, which assume the Company will be able
to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. However, the Company has generated limited
revenues and has a working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016. The
Company has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of
revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time
and currently does not have the funding to fully implement its business-plan.
Therefore there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating sustainable profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due and finance the
implementation of its business plan.  

Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on
additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to
position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the
capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that
the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become
financially viable and continue as a going concern.  

Note

SUMMARY
  OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis of presentation     

  The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company s year-end
is March 31. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and
related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim
financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission set forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
 Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  The unaudited
interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  Unaudited
interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full
fiscal year.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2016 and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K.  

    Use of Estimates    

  The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Basic Income (Loss) Per Share    

  The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260
 Earnings per Share . Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their
effect is anti-dilutive. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015 there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity
instruments issued or outstanding.

Revenue Recognition    

  The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
No. 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC-605 ), ASC-605 requires that
four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3)
the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's
judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products
delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and
rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments
are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company
will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is
subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly
determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

  We
have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This annual report and other reports
filed by Addentax Group Corp.   ( we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ), from
time to time contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information
that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the
Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s
management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the
date hereof. When used in the filings, the words  anticipate,   believe, 
 estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these
terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s
management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the
current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to
risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should one or more of
these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions
prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those
anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  

Although the Company believes that the
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the
Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or
achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the
forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  

Our financial statements are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
( GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates,
judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and
assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available
to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made.
These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our
financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material
differences between these estimates.  

Overview    

Addentax Group Corp. was incorporated in
the State of Nevada on October 28, 2014 and established a fiscal year-end of
March 31. We are in the development stage and were incorporated to produce
images on multiple surfaces, such as glass, leather, plastic, ceramic, textile,
and others using a 3D sublimation vacuum heat transfer machine.   

Our
business office is located at 70, Av Allan Ben Abdellah, Fes, Morocco 30000.
Our telephone number is +17026606161.  

Our Business    

The Company is working on a field of
producing images on a surface such as glass, leather, plastic, ceramic,
textile, and others using 3D sublimation vacuum heat transfer machines. Heat
transfer technology is one of most economical methods of application. This
modern technology has been quite popular for many years and has not lost its
relevance. Materials for images can be varied, such as ceramics, glass,
crockery of different quality, metal, clothing, caps, bags, leather products
and other products. Our products are intended for individuals, business owners
associated with the sale of souvenirs, and business owners who intend to order
souvenirs in the corporate style. In order to organize our business, we need
equipment and supplies, so that we can make the images on customer s products,
and then we will rent more warehouse space for goods on which to apply the
images. We plan to conclude a contract of carriage with local shipping
companies for delivery of our goods to other cities such as Meknes, Rabat,
Kenitra and worldwide.  

3D sublimation vacuum heat
transfer machine    

We use 3D sublimation vacuum heat
transfer technology to apply images on many surfaces. The 3D sublimation vacuum
heat transfer machine does not require high technical skill for product
production. A set of printing materials includes the machine itself, and all
raw materials necessary for setting up and testing, and raw materials for the
production process.   

Our industrial flatbed printing machine
is not large, is user-friendly, is simple to maintain, and doesn t require any special
service.  

9        

Target
market    

We can determine two different
directions our product can cover - corporate and private. By corporate, we mean
large and small companies, who always care about image and updating company
information. Corporate styles of any company are often reflected by printed
images on pens, souvenirs, notepads, laptops and others. We are ready to
provide image printing on any of the aforesaid products. By private we mean any
private events, where memorable gifts can be suitable. Weddings, birthdays, and
anniversaries, any holiday of any scale can become even more memorable with
some kind of commemorative image on a glass or metal souvenir, which can be
hung on the wall, for example. Addentax Group Corp. is able to offer any type
of client the printed product that can meet its special requirements.  

We have signed a contract for the sale
of goods with Derb il Horra, a small enterprise, which is involved mostly in
selling souvenirs not only in Fes, but also in another cities in Morocco.  

Marketing    

Our sole officer and director, Otmane
Tajmouati, is responsible for the marketing of the Company. We intend to use
marketing strategies, such as the World Wide Web, namely, dissemination of
information on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and other sites with
ads, direct mailing, and distribution of flyers in hotels, cafes and
restaurants, by handing out flyers in public and tourists  spots and shopping
malls to acquire potential customers. We believe that one of the most powerful
aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a
high degree of accuracy that will also be cost effective. We will use many
online marketing tools to direct traffic to our website and identify potential
customers. As of the date of these financial statements we have registered a
domain name for our website www.addentaxgroup.com and have
included initial information about the Company and its products. To accomplish
this, we plan to contact an independent web designing company. Our website
describes our products, shows our contact information, and includes some
general information and pictures of our products. We also plan to attend shows
and exhibitions in our industry and other related industries, where it would be
appropriate to attract new customers and advertise our products. We will also
promote our products through word-of-mouth.  

Also, we have prepared a brochure
representing Addentax Group Corp. and our business, which contains basic
information about the Company. We believe it will help us in our marketing upon
commencement of our production process and for making our products known to
potential customers.   

Storage and delivery    

The
product produced by Addentax Group Corp. does not require any storage
facilities. It is produced directly for each order. The number of demonstration
samples kept is insignificant and doesn t require any special premises for
storage. We intend to sign a contract with a freight company to deliver our
products. We expect that term of delivery shall be not more than 15 days, which
shall include production and acceptance by clients.  

Competition    

We are in direct competition with other
companies offering similar products. Nearly all Addentax Group Corp.'s
competitors have significantly greater financial resources, technical
expertise, and managerial capabilities than Addentax Group Corp. We are,
consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such
products and become a successful company in the printing industry. Therefore, Addentax
Group Corp. may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all.  

Insurance    

We do not maintain any insurance and do
not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any
insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not
have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs, a judgment
could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.  

Employees    

10        

We are at a development stage and
do not have employees, other than our sole officer, Otmane Tajmouati, who will
initially perform all work in production and organization of our business.  

Offices    

Our
business office is located at 70, Av Allan Ben Abdellah, Fes, Morocco 30000.
Our telephone number is +17026606161.   

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Results of Operations for the three and six
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:  

Revenue and cost of goods sold   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company generated total revenue of $6,950 and
$3,000 from selling printed products to its customer. The cost of goods sold
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $1,017
and $325, which represents the cost of raw materials.  

For the six months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company generated total revenue of $9,950 and $3,000.
The cost of goods sold for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015 was $1,531 and $325, which represents the cost of raw
materials.   

We expect to generate more revenues as
we expand our business operations.   

Operating expenses   

Total operating expenses for the     three months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $6,177 and $4,668. The
operating expenses     for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 included accounting fees of $1,500;
bank charges of $400; depreciation expense of $267; regulatory filing fees of $690;
legal fees of $2,750; and rent expense of $570. The operating expenses for the
six months ended September 30, 2015 included accounting fees of $2,850; bank
charges of $141; depreciation expense of $267; legal fees of $0; regulatory
filing fees of $840; and rent expense of $570. The increase in the operating
expenses was mainly due to the increase in accounting and legal fees because of
the change in the timing when the audit and legal services were provided to the
company in connection with the SEC filings.  

Total operating expenses for the     six months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $29,944 and $9,615. The
operating expenses     for
the six months ended September 30, 2016 included accounting fees of $4,850;
bank charges of $670; depreciation expense of $534; regulatory filing fees of $19,520;
legal fees of $3,230; and rent expense of $1,140. The operating expenses for
the six months ended September 30, 2015 included accounting fees of $4,850;
bank charges of $251; depreciation expense of $534; legal fees of $2,000;
regulatory filing fees of $840; and rent expense of $1,140. The increase in the
operating expenses was mainly due to the increase in accounting and legal fees
because of the change in the timing when the audit and legal services were
provided to the company in connection with the SEC filings and to the increase
in the regulatory filing fees related to issuances of common shares to
investors.  

Net Income/Loss   

The net loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $244 and $1,993.  

The net loss for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $21,525 and $6,912.  

Increase in net loss as of September 30,
2016 compare to September 30, 2015 indicate increase in operating expenses of
the Company.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash
Requirements   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $2,201 ($10,052 as of
March 31, 2016).   Furthermore, the Company had negative working
capital of $16,178 (positive working capital of $4,259 as of March 31, 2016).   

11        

During the six months ended September
30, 2016 the Company used $20,905 of cash in operating activities due to net
loss of $21,525, the increase in raw material inventory of $1,054, decrease in
prepaid rent of $1,140 and depreciation of $534.    

During the six months ended September
30, 2016, the Company did not generate or use cash in investing activities.  

During the six months ended September
30, 2016, the Company received cash from financing activities of $13,054, due
to issuance of  
a total of 37,000 common shares for cash contribution of $554 and received cash
in the amount of $12,500 in the form of loans from our director.   

We
are planning to raise $90,000 through a public offering. There is no assurance
that the full amount, or any amount, will be obtained. The following table sets
forth the uses of proceeds for the twelve months assuming
the funding of 33%, 66%, and 100%, respectively:  

There is no assurance that our company
will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital
requirements.  

There is substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is
dependent upon public
offering and
achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity
securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests
of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to
meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited
consolidated financial statements, our independent auditors included an
explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that
we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our
assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of
business.  

Future Financing Requirements    

We will need to obtain proper funding
from equity and/or additional debt financing in order to be able to fulfill our
projections. Failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital
or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to achieve our business objectives and will greatly affect our
ability to continue as a going concern.  

Effective
March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with Otmane Tajmouati,
the Company s sole officer and director. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement,
Mr. Tajmouati agreed to loan up to $30,000 to the Company to fund its ongoing expenses

Company by Mr. Tajmouati as of     September 30, 2016 was not advanced under the
terms of this loan agreement.    

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

12        

The Company does
not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Critical Accounting Policies    

Basis of presentation     

  The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The
Company s year-end is March 31.  

Use of Estimates

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk.   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are
not required to provide information required by this Item  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rule 13a     15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

We carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .
Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in
light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial
reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting    

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2016
using the   criteria established in  Internal Control -
Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  

13        

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of September
30, 2016,
the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted
material weaknesses, as described below.  

1.           We do not have
an Audit Committee   While not being
legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that
such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important
entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the
Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not
include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide
the necessary oversight over management s activities.  

2.           We did not
maintain appropriate cash controls   As of September 30, 2016, the Company
has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for
cash, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions,
and did not require dual signatures on the Company s bank accounts.
Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact
that the Company had limited transactions in its bank accounts.  

3.           We did not
implement appropriate information technology controls   As at September 30,
2016,
the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements;
however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the
Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement,
or loss due to unmitigated factors.   

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s
internal controls.  

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded
that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September
30, 2016
based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued
by COSO.   

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting    

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred
during our second fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that
permit the Company to provide only management s report in this quarterly
report.
