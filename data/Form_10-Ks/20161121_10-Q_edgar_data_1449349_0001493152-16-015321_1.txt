NOTE
1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly
the results of operations of the Company for the period presented. The results of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period or the fiscal year ending December
31, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet,
where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances reported for cash,
prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate the fair value because of their short
maturities.  

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
These tiers include:  

Level
1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;  

Level
2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and  

Level
3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions,
such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are
unobservable.  

The
Company measures certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis were calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and are as follows at September 30, 2016:  

Consolidation   

Our
financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates which consist of IsoPet Solutions, a wholly owned subsidiary which was
established in May 2016. IsoPet Solutions will focus on bringing AMI s yttrium-90 brachytherapy products to veterinary oncologists
to treat animals such as dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers. IsoPet Solutions is currently establishing the infrastructure
necessary to provide product to veterinary clinics including regulatory clearances and compliance. As of September 30, 2016 there
have been no revenues nor expenses incurred in the IsoPet Solutions subsidiary.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

There
are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company believes are applicable or would have a material impact on the
financial statements of the Company.  

NOTE
2: GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses and used significant cash in support of its operating activities and the Company s cash position
is not sufficient to support the Company s operations. Historically, the Company has relied upon outside investor funds
to maintain the Company s operations and develop the Company s business. The Company anticipates it will continue
to require funding from investors for working capital as well as business expansion during this fiscal year and it can provide
no assurance that additional investor funds will be available on terms acceptable to us. These factors, among others, may indicate
that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable time. In addition, the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered
by entrance into established markets and the competitive environment in which it operates.  

The
Company anticipates a requirement of $1.5 million in funds over the next twelve months to maintain current operation activities.
The Company may also require up to approximately $1.5 million to retire outstanding debt and past due payables, As of September
30, 2016 the Company has certain convertible promissory notes totaling approximately $260,000 that are currently due and payable
(  Outstanding Notes  . These notes were satisfied during November 2016. See Note 10: Subsequent Events.  

The
Company requires funding of at least $1.5 million per year to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12-24 months,
the Company believes it will cost approximately $5 million to $10 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial deployment
of the brachytherapy products and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued deployment
of the brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel. The
principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12-24 months will be the FDA s
classification of the Company s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements
for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s
spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company s arrangements
with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products  success in the
U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership
agreements or additional capital raises.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has $15 cash on hand. There are currently commitments to vendors for products and services
purchased, accrued compensation expenses and the Company s current lease commitments that in the absence of additional capital
would result in a liquidation of the Company. The current level of cash is not enough to cover the fixed and variable obligations
of the Company.  

Assuming
the Company is successful in the Company s sales/development effort it believes that it will be able to raise additional
funds through strategic agreements or the sale of the Company s stock to either current or new stockholders. There is no
guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or to do so at an advantageous price.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern
is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain
profitability. The Company plans to seek additional funding to maintain its operations through debt and equity financing and to
improve operating performance through a focus on strategic products and increased efficiencies in business processes and improvements
to the cost structure. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional working capital
or achieve profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

changed its name to Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation. AMI has authorized capital of 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock,
$0.001 par value per share and 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (ADMD: OTCQB).  

AMI
is a late stage radiation oncology focused medical device company engaged in the development of yttrium-90 based brachytherapy
devices for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. Brachytherapy uses radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive
isotope inside or next to the treatment area. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with
strategic partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company s development
efforts. AMI has been recognized as a leader in the development of new isotope technologies by local, state and federal agencies.
The Company s overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers and patients by providing them with
new isotope technologies that offer safe and effective treatments for cancer.  

Since
late 2013, AMI has focused its resources on developing a proposed line of yttrium-90 based brachytherapy products for the treatment
of non-resectable tumors and on endeavoring to secure FDA clearance with respect to the initial proposed brachytherapy product.
AMI s proposed brachytherapy products incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle Memorial Institute ( Battelle )
at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted
AMI an exclusive license to patents covering these developments for manufacturing, processing and applications for medical isotopes
(the  Battelle License ).  

The
Company s lead product is the Y-90 RadioGel  device. The Company is currently conducting additional bench and animal
tests requested by the FDA to support a new  de novo  filing with the FDA that would request marketing clearance for the
device as a Class II medical device in the United States. The Company is also exploring the pathway to regulatory clearance in
other international markets.  

In
May of 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, IsoPet Solutions Corporation, to focus on the vibrant and expanding
veterinary oncology market. IsoPet Solutions will focus on bringing AMI s yttrium-90 brachytherapy products to veterinary
oncologists to treat animals such as dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers. IsoPet Solutions is currently establishing the
infrastructure necessary to provide product to veterinary clinics including regulatory clearances and compliance.  

Funded
by a $250,000 Life Sciences grant, AMI is the commercial partner with Washington State University for treating cats with feline
sarcoma. In October 2016 the first companion animal (a person s pet) was injected with IsoPet. At last report, there no
adverse effects, and the center of the tumor is successfully showing necrosis. A second cat is scheduled to be injected in December
2016.  

Research
and development of the Company s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt
securities as well as a series of grants. On October 28, 2010, the Company received $1,215,000 net proceeds from a Department
of Energy grant for the Proposed Congressionally Directed Project entitled  Research to Develop and Test an Advanced Resorbable
Brachytherapy Seed Research for Controlled Delivery of Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Cancer Treatment.  On October 29, 2010,
the Company received notification it had been awarded $244,479 grant funds from the Qualified Therapeutic Discovery Project Program
for this same Brachytherapy Project. Additionally, on September 1, 2015, the Company received notification it had been awarded
from Washington State University, $42,019 grant funds from the sub-award project entitled  Optimized Injectable Radiogels
for High-dose Therapy of Non-Resectable Solid Tumors .  

The
Company requires funding of approximately $1.5 million annually to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12-24
months, the Company believes it will cost approximately $5 million to $10 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial
deployment of the brachytherapy products and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued
deployment of the brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel.
The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12-24 months will be the
FDA s classification of the Company s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any
requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount
of the Company s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company s
arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products 
success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing
and partnership agreements or additional capital raises.  

Following
receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing, in the United States, the Company intends to outsource material aspects
of manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing. Outside of the United States, the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements
and/or partnerships to facilitate its global commercialization strategy.  

In
the longer-term, subject to the Company receiving adequate funding, regulatory approval for brachytherapy products and thereafter
being successful in commercializing brachytherapy products, the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect
to other products and technologies. The Company s core goal is to develop and commercialize isotopes, businesses and technologies
intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses. Among those longer-term projects being considered
by the Company are potential solutions for the impending severe shortages of Molybendum-99 and its derivative product Technetium-99m,
the most widely used isotopes for diagnostic purposes.  

Based
on the Company s financial history since inception, its auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and has accumulated deficits since inception.
If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to delay the implementation of its business
strategy and not be able to continue operations.  

2016
Significant Events      

On
July 11, 2016, the Company announced that it has partnered with Versant Medical Physics and Radiation Safety company to provide
dosimetry expertise to support development of the Company s brachytherapy devices. Versant, a provider of comprehensive
medical physics consulting services, will provide AMI with expert scientific and technical support on dosimetry, which is the
calculation and assessment of the radiation dose received by the human body, for AMI s medical devices. This formal relationship
between AMI and Versant provides AMI access to experts in medical physics and dosimetry, including Versant physicist Dr. Darrell
Fisher. The relationship with Versant provides a formal manner for Dr. Fisher to engage with AMI in a more meaningful and impactful
way. Dr. Fisher has previously provided AMI with key input on product development including regulatory and commercialization issues
and holds seven patents, including patents licensed by AMI for its brachytherapy products. Dr. Fisher is known internationally
for his expertise in the dosimetry and effects of radioactive materials, including medically administered radiopharmaceuticals
for diagnostic and therapeutic benefit. Dr. Fisher is a recent president of the Health Physics Society, an international organization
of professionals engaged in the science and practice of radiation safety. He also serves on the Medical Internal Radiation Dose
Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, which develops standard methods for radiopharmaceutical dosimetry.
Dr. Fisher previously served on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission s Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes.
He recently completed a 35-year career at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  

On
July 19, 2016 the Company   provided an update
on its intellectual property including trademark expansion in international markets. AMI has a robust patent portfolio that includes
exclusive rights under patents that cover medical isotope applications, processing and manufacturing. AMI is currently in negotiations
with two organizations to enhance its patent portfolio related to its brachytherapy products. AMI continues to aggressively pursue
trademark and patent protection for its brachytherapy products in anticipation of international product introduction. The Company
has trademarked its leading cancer treatment under the RadioGel(TM) device trademark across the globe. The mark recently received
registration in Hong Kong and Singapore. The mark has been allowed in the United States, and is registered under WIPO (World International
Property Organization) in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and the European Community (28 countries). It is
also registered in the non-WIPO countries of Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand and is pending in China and Indonesia. The RadioGel(TM)
device trademark registration includes multiple product classes in many of these countries.  

On
October 6, 2016 the Company  announced that the first household pet, a cat, has been treated for feline sarcoma with the Company s
pet version of the Y-90 RadioGel(TM) device. Following the initial treatment, the cat is scheduled to undergo seven follow-up
appointments over a two year period.  The study outcome data will be reported to AMI periodically.  Funding for this
study was provided by a grant from the Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund where AMI is the commercialization partner.   

On
November 10, 2016 the Company announced the repayment of matured Convertible Notes and the resolution of all disputes and lawsuits
related to these notes.  

Products     

Brachytherapy   

Pursuant
to the Battelle License, the Company has licensed certain exclusive rights to yttrium-90 (Y-90) polymer composite technology developed
at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. The license agreement
grants the Company the exclusive right to manufacture and market products using the yttrium-90 isotope carried by an injectable
water-based biodegradable polymer. The use of yttrium 90 (Y-90) for the treatment of cancers is well established.  

Subject
to receipt of all required regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States and analogous regulators outside of the United
States, the Company plans to introduce a new Y-90-based brachytherapy product line for a range of applications for the delivery
of a prescribed dose of radiation to a target site. If the Company receives FDA clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel  device,
subject to receipt of adequate financing, the Company will commence production, sales, and distribution of that product. Also,
subject to receipt of adequate financing, the Company intends then to seek FDA clearance for the two additional products described
below, each of which also incorporates the patented technologies licensed from Battelle. Even if the FDA grants clearance for
the Y-90 RadioGel  device there can be no assurance the FDA would also grant clearance for either or both of the foregoing
products.  

Y-90
RadioGel  device  - combines Y-90 particles with a polymer carrier that may be injected directly into the tumor.  

Y-90
Fast-Resorbable Polymer Seeds  - Y-90 contained within a polymer seed, as opposed to metal or glass. This product would be
used in place of treating cancers with currently marketed titanium or glass seeds.  

Y-90
Polymer Topical Paste    designed to be applied directly to tissue surfaces after surgical tumor removals (also referred
to as  resections ) to treat residual tumor cells.  

Based
upon its studies and analyses, or general application of experience with current brachytherapy devices and yttrium-90, the Company
believes that if it is able to obtain regulatory approval and adequate financing to commercialize our products, our brachytherapy
products are likely to offer the following benefits, among others, for patients and medical professionals:  

Maximizing
    Therapeutic Index: The short-range beta particles emitted by Y-90 deliver radiation energy within a tight range. This enables
    radiation to be selectively delivered to target tissues while minimizing radiation dose to nearby normal tissues. High therapeutic
    indices imply that more radiation energy may be imparted to cancer tissues, with less radiation reaching adjacent normal tissues.   

Half
    Life: The industry-standard products have a half-life of 17 days, meaning the patient is radioactive for over two months.
    The Company s brachytherapy products use the yttrium-90 isotope, which has a half-life of just 2.7 days. A patient treated
    with Y-90 would be close to radiation free in 10 days.   

Optimized
    Delivery Method: Current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal particles seeds in the prostate by using up to 30 large
    gauge needles. By contrast, the Company s biodegradable polymer carrying Y-90 particles may be administered with small-gauge
    needles.   

No
    Permanent Seeds Remaining: Other brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the tumor. The Company s Y-90
    RadioGel  device utilizes a biodegradable, non-toxic polymer that is ultimately absorbed by the body. This eliminates
    the possibility of a long-term seed migration or other problems that may sometimes arise when seeds remain in the body.   

Good
    Safety Profile: Many current brachytherapy devices utilize isotopes that emit x-rays (akin to gamma radiation). X-rays or
    gamma radiation travels within and outside of the body and the isotopes used in current brachytherapy products can remain
    radioactive for more than two months. The Company s brachytherapy products use the yttrium-90 isotope, which is a beta-emitter.
    The yttrium-90 beta-emissions travel only a short distance and have a short half life of 2.7 days.   

In
June 2015, the FDA notified the Company that the  de novo  submitted on December 23, 2014 for its Y-90 RadioGel  device
pursuant to Section 513(f)(2) of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the  Act ) was not accepted. The Company had
several formal and informal interactions with the FDA during the second half of 2015 to clarify the agency s expectations
for data and testing to be provided in a future filing. The Company has incorporated the feedback from the FDA into its continued
and active product development and commercialization efforts, utilizing its partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group.  

Competitors
and Markets     

There
are established competitors in all of the markets in which the Company has products or currently plans to have products.  

Brachytherapy   

Brachytherapy
is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area. According
to the 2014 MEDraysintell report, the global market for brachytherapy reached US$ 680 million in 2013 and is projected to reach
$2.4 billion by 2030. It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market. The Company believes
there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers. The 2014 U.S. estimated new
cases of cancer according to the American Cancer Society are 233,000 prostate, 235,030 breast, 31,190 liver, and 46,420 pancreas.  

There
are a wide variety of cancer treatments approved and marketed in the U.S. and globally. General categories of treatment include
surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. These products have a diverse set of success rates and side effects.
The Company s products fall into a particular type of radiation therapy called brachytherapy. There are a number of brachytherapy
devices currently marketed in the U.S. and globally. The traditional iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) technologies
for brachytherapy are well entrenched with powerful market players controlling the market. The industry-standard I-125-based therapy
was developed by Oncura, which is a unit of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Additionally, C.R. Bard, a major industry player
competes in the I-125 brachytherapy marketplace. These market competitors are also involved in the distribution of Pd-103 based
products. Cs-131 brachytherapy products are sold by IsoRay (AMEX:ISR). Several Y-90 therapies have been FDA approved including
SIR-Spheres by Sirtex (OTC:SXMDF), TheraSphere by Biocompatibles UK (OTC:BCTBF) and Zevalin by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI).  

Veterinary
Brachytherapy   

There
are about 150 million pet dogs and cats in the United States. Nearly half of dogs and one third of cats are diagnosed with cancer
at some point in their lifetime. The Veterinary Oncology   Hermatology Center in Norwalk, CT reports that cancer is the number
one natural cause of death in older cats and dogs, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year. The American Veterinary
Medical Association reports that half of the dogs ten years or older will die because of cancer. The National Cancer Institute
reports that about six million dogs are diagnosed with cancer each year, translating to more than 16,000 a day. The average cost
of treating tumors in dogs using radiation is $5,000-7,000 according to petcarerx.com.  

There
are oncology treatments available currently in the U.S. and globally for the veterinary market represent a similar, but smaller
set of products than is available for the human market.  

Employees     

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had four full-time employees. The Company utilizes eight to ten independent contractors to
assist with its operations. The Company does not have a collective bargaining agreement with any of its employees, and believes
its relations with its employees are good. The Company is not current on payroll and requires additional funding to make past
and current payroll payments.  

Raw
Materials     

The
Company manufactures research quantities of brachytherapy products or components of these products. The Company obtains supplies,
hardware, handling equipment and packaging from several different U.S. and foreign suppliers. Some of the products the Company
manufactures or intend to manufacture require purchasing raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, many of which are international
suppliers.  

Customers     

The
Company anticipates that potential customers for our potential brachytherapy products likely would include those institutions
and individuals that currently purchase brachytherapy products or other oncology treatment products.

The
following table sets forth information from our statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Revenue     

Revenue
was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $12,054 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was
a result of a decrease in consulting revenues due to a reduction in consulting services provided. Consulting revenues consist
of providing a company with assistance in strategic targetry services, and research into production of radiopharmaceuticals and
the operations of radioisotope production facilities. No proprietary information belonging to our Company is shared during the
process of this consulting.  

Operating
Expenses     

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $666,414 and $305,865, respectively. The increase in operating
expenses from 2015 to 2016 can be attributed to the increase in Professional Fees expenses ($73,864 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 versus $265,497 for the three months ended September 30, 2016); an increase in Sales and Marketing expenses
from 2015 to 2016 ($0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 versus $65,995 for the three months ended September 30, 2016);
an increase in stock options granted from 2015 to 2016 ($0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 versus $27,427 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016); and the increase in General and Administrative Expenses ($52,411 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 versus $146,257 for the three months ended September 30, 2016).  

The
increase in Professional Fees was due to the Company executing an agreement for $200,000 with an entity to provide advisory services.
The increase in Marketing Expense was due to the Company executing an agreement for $20,000 per month with an entity to provide
investor relation services. The increase in General and Administrative Expense was due to an increase in research expense ($102,691
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus $25,820 for the three months ended September 30, 2015). The increase in research
expense was due to the additional research efforts brought on with the Company s partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group
plus the agreement with Versant Medical Physics and Radiation Safety to provide scientific and technical support to assist with
new product development.  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists of the following:  

Non-Operating
Income (Expense)     

Non-operating
income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 varied from the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to decrease
in interest expense from $1,818,017 to $85,830 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This decrease
was due to the Company s reduction in overall debt as well as debt discounts. Loss on settlement of debt increased from
a $144,290 gain to a $111,328 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Gain on derivative liability
increased from $562,203 loss to $762,151 gain for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This gain
was as a result of the decrease in convertible debt.  

Non-Operating
income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists of the following:  

Net
Loss     

Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $155,982 and $2,530,741 respectively.  

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

The
following table sets forth information from our statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Revenue     

Revenue
was $8,108 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $24,108 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a period
over period decrease of $16,000. The decrease was a result of a loss of consulting revenue, currently our only source of revenue,
during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Consulting revenue consists of providing clients with assistance in strategic
targetry services, and research into production of radiopharmaceuticals and the operations of radioisotope production facilities.
No proprietary information belonging to our Company is shared during the process of this consulting. Consulting services are currently
our only source of revenue and is expected to generate less than $50,000 per year.  

Operating
Expense     

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4,575,904 and $977,763, respectively. The increase in operating
expenses from 2015 to 2016 can be attributed to the increase in Professional Fees expenses ($245,164 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 versus $1,968,084 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016); an increase in Sales and Marketing expenses
from 2015 to 2016 ($0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 versus $213,539 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016);
an increase in stock options granted from 2015 to 2016 ($28,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 versus $612,343 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016); and the increase in General and Administrative Expenses ($160,254 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 versus $1,287,649 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016).  

Professional
fees increased due to the exercise of previously issued warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock that were exercised in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. These warrants were issued pursuant to an advisory agreement
related to the negotiation and implementation of comprehensive restructuring plan. The Company incurred a $1,069,353 non-cash
expense related to the warrant exercise. In addition, the Company entered into an advisory agreement with a retainer of $200,000
and, which payment has been deferred and the future issuance of RSU s to assist the Company in formulating and implementing
its operating plan. In addition the Company incurred $216,608 expense from the issuance of stock and options to Directors, Officers,
Employees, and Consultants. In addition, the Company s legal fees increased from $63,007 to $235,285 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This increase was due to the Company defending itself from lawsuits brought on
by convertible notes in default and the dispute with BancLease and Washington Trust Bank regarding application of lease payments
to the principal loan amount for the linear accelerator.  

The
increase in Marketing Expense was due to the Company executing an agreement for $20,000 per month with an entity to provide investor
relation services as well as an overall increase in marketing and sales efforts.  

The
main contributors to the increase in General and Administrative Expenses was an increase in Loan Fees ($603,861 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 versus $13,917 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015); Repairs and Maintenance ($226,655 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $5,979 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015); and an increase in Research
Expense ($309,539 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $40,029 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015).  

The
increase in loan fees were due to the agreement to provide a percentage of loan proceeds as Series A Preferred shares. The increase
in repairs and maintenance was due to the cost of moving the liner accelerator. The increase in research expense was due to the
additional research efforts brought on with the Company s partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group plus the agreement with
Versant Medical Physics and Radiation Safety to provide scientific and technical support to assist with new product development.  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists of the following:  

Non-Operating
Income (Expense)     

The
Company had non-operating income of $6,566,783 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to non-operating expense
of $(5,576,972) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As shown below, this decrease in non-operating income is primarily
due to a loss on derivative liability of $3,108,889 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a gain of $8,756,184
during the same period in 2015. The $3,108,889 loss on derivative liability is due to an increase in the Company s stock
price from January 2, 2015 ($0.0008) to September 30, 2016 ($0.0017) and an increase in preferred shares value which is also used
to value derivatives. The Company s stock price is used in the Black Scholes calculations to compute the derivative liability
at the end of the quarter. Additionally, the Company experienced a decrease in non-operating income due to a loss on settlement
of debt of $1,877,959 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a gain on settlement of debt of $281,966 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in debt settlement costs was due to the successful negotiations in settling
many of the debt that had been in default. The Company experienced a $54,561 loss on sale of stock for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. This loss on sale of stock derived from the sale of 46,666 Series A Preferred shares for $70,000. The value of the Company s
Series A Preferred stock, because it is not openly traded, was derived at utilizing Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standards Codification topic 718 which determined a value of $5.4152 and $3.8294 we used each for 10,000 shares and 36,666 shares,
respectively. The decrease in non-operating income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense ($535,563 and $2,471,367
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). The decrease in interest expense was due to the Company s
reduction in overall debt as well as debt discounts.  

Non-Operating
income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consists of the following:  

Net
Income (Loss)     

Our
net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(10,144,168) and $5,613,098, respectively, due primarily
to the increase of operating expenses of $4,575,904 and $977,763 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively; plus an increase of $12,143,755 in non-operating loss of $(5,576,972 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a non-operating gain of $6,566,783 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $4,126,519, as compared to $9,755,129 at September 30, 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company experienced negative cash flow from operations of $1,645,825 and it expended
$0 for investing activities while adding $1,466,808 of cash flows from financing activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had $0 commitments for capital expenditures.  

Cash
used in operating activities increased from $676,826 for the nine month period ending September 30, 2015 to $1,645,825 for the
nine month period ending September 30, 2016. Cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the Company s net
loss, partially offset by non-cash items, such as loss on derivative liability and amortization and depreciation, included in
that net loss and preferred and common stock issued for services and other expenses. The Company had no cash used in investing
activities for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Cash provided from financing activities increased from
$684,019 for the nine month period ending September 30, 2015 to $1,466,808 for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.
The increase in cash provided from financing activities was primarily a result of increase in proceeds from convertible debt.  

The
Company has generated material operating losses since inception. The Company had a net loss of $10,144,168 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and net income of $5,613,098 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company expects to continue
to experience net operating losses. Historically, the Company has relied upon investor funds to maintain its operations and develop
the Company s business. The Company anticipates raising additional capital within the next twelve months from investors
for working capital as well as business expansion, although the Company can provide no assurance that additional investor funds
will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing to meet its working
capital requirements, it may have to curtail its business.  

The
Company anticipates raising additional capital within the next twelve months from investors for working capital as well as business
expansion, although the Company can provide no assurance that additional investor funds will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing to meet its working capital requirements, it may have
to cease operations.  

The
Company requires funding of at least $1.5 million per year to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12-24 months,
the Company believes it will cost approximately $5 million to $10 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial deployment
of the brachytherapy products and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued deployment
of the brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel. The
principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12-24 months will be the FDA s
classification of the Company s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements
for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s
spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company s arrangements
with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products  success in the
U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership
agreements or additional capital raises.  

Although
the Company is seeking the foregoing funding and has engaged in numerous discussions with potential finders, investment bankers
and investors with respect to the initial portion thereof, the Company has not received firm commitments for the required funding.
Based upon its discussions, the Company anticipates that if the Company is able to obtain the funding required to retire outstanding
debt, pay past due payables and maintain its current operating activities that the terms thereof will be materially dilutive to
existing shareholders.  

The
recent economic events, including the inherent instability and volatility in global capital markets, as well as the lack of liquidity
in the capital markets, could impact its ability to obtain financing and its ability to execute its business plan. The Company
believes healthcare institutions will continue to purchase the medical solutions that it distributes.  

Legal
Contingencies     

There
Company has an ongoing dispute with BancLease and Washington Trust Bank regarding application of lease payments to the principal
loan amount for the linear accelerator, and the Company believes it has overpaid by approximately $300,000. On November 18, 2016
the Company is scheduled to appear in court on a motion for summary judgement to award the Company approximately $540,000, including
attorney fees of approximately $40,000. At this time, the Company believes it will prevail in this matter, however there can be
no assurance as to the outcome of this event.  

In addition, there were
disputes related to approximately $260,901 principle value of past due notes as of September 30, 2016. On November 10, 2016 the
Company announced that it has successfully repaid these notes. The repayment of these notes resolved all disputes and lawsuits
related to these notes. 

Accounting
Policies and Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2016, we believe there have been no
significant changes to the items disclosed as significant accounting policies in management s notes to the consolidated
financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on May 25, 2016 (Amendment
was filed on May 26, 2016).  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the
Company s financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

Based
on an evaluation as of the date of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, because of the disclosed material weaknesses in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the
period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
SEC s rules and forms.  

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the
Company s Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s
last fiscal quarter (the Company s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

The
term  internal control over financial reporting  is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the registrant s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the registrant s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  

(a)  
      Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the registrant;   

(b)  
      Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and   

(c)  
      Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

PROMISSORY NOTE    

FOR
VALUE RECEIVED ,  ADVANCED MEDICAL ISOTOPE CORP. , a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the
 Borrower ), hereby promises to pay to the order of ______________ , a _________________, or registered
assigns (the  Holder ) the principal sum of up to $_________ (the  Principal Amount ), together with
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum (with the initial 6 months of interest being guaranteed upon the Issue
Date), at maturity or upon acceleration or otherwise, as set forth herein (the  Note ). The consideration to the
Borrower for this Note is $________ (the  Consideration ). The maturity date shall be six (6) months from the
Issue Date (the  Maturity Date ), and is the date upon which the principal sum, as well as any accrued and unpaid
interest and other fees, shall be due and payable. The Maturity Date shall be extended to seven (7) months from the Issue
Date in the event that the Borrower pays a penalty equal to 5% of the total outstanding principal and accrued interest under
the Note (as calculated on the date that Borrower pays such penalty) (the  First Extension Payment ) to Holder,
provided that such payment shall be made prior to the six month anniversary of the Issue Date. The Maturity Date shall be
extended to eight (8) months from the Issue Date in the event that the Borrower pays the First Extension Payment within the
allocated timeframe and an additional penalty equal to 5% of the total outstanding principal and accrued interest under the
Note (as calculated on the date that Borrower pays such penalty) to Holder, provided that such payment shall be made prior to
the seven month anniversary of the Issue Date. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise
explicitly set forth herein. Any amount of principal or interest on this Note, which is not paid by the Maturity Date, shall
bear interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid
( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and shall be
computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent
not converted into common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the  Common Stock ) in accordance with the terms
hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made at such address as the
Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note. Whenever
any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day, the same shall
instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which is not
the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for
purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business day 
shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are
authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event the Company has not filed a registration statement on Form S-1 for the primary sale of the Company s common stock
by the four (4) month anniversary of the closing of the Note, the Company shall not have the ability to extend the maturity
date of the Note as provided herein and the Note will automatically be deemed in default on the six (6) month anniversary of
the closing of the Note.  

This
Note carries a prorated original issue discount of $________ (the  OID ), to cover Holder s accounting fees,
due diligence fees, monitoring, and/or other non-legal transactional costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of
the Note, which is included in the principal balance of this Note. Thus, the purchase price of this Note shall be $________, computed
as follows: the Principal Amount less the OID.  

This
Note is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof.  

The
following additional terms shall apply to this Note:  

ARTICLE
I. CONVERSION RIGHTS  

1.1
 Conversion Right . The Holder shall have the right at any time to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid
principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such
Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common
Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined as provided
herein (a  Conversion ); provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of
this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned
through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security
of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of
this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined
in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Regulations
13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however, that the limitations
on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days  prior notice to the
Borrower, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as
determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon
each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion
Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice
of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice
of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice)
to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ). The term
 Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this
Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal
amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Holder s option, Default Interest,
if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s option,
any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof.  

1.2
 Conversion Price .  

(a)
 Calculation of Conversion Price . The Conversion Price shall equal$ 0.20 per share, provided, however, that immediately
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Note, the Conversion Price shall automatically equal the Variable Conversion
Price (as defined herein) (subject, in each case, to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings
by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations,
recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events)(also subject to adjustment as further described
herein). The  Variable Conversion Price  shall mean the lesser of (i) $0.20 or (ii) 60% multiplied by the Market Price
(as defined herein).  Market Price  means the lowest one (1) Trading Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock
during the thirty (30) Trading Day period ending on the last complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading
Prices  means, for any security as of any date, the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock on the Over-the-Counter Pink Marketplace,
or applicable trading market (the  OTC PINK ) as reported by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service )
designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTC PINK is not the principal trading market for such security, on the principal
securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if the lowest intraday trading price of such
security is not available in any of the foregoing manners, the lowest intraday price of any market makers for such security that
are quoted on the OTC Markets. If the Trading Prices cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided
above, the Trading Prices shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority
in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Prices are required in order to determine the
Conversion Price of such Notes.  Trading Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period
on the OTC PINK, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.
Upon the first occurrence of an Event of Default under this Note, the 60% multipliers contained in the Variable Conversion Price
calculation shall be automatically adjusted to 45% (resulting in a discount of 55%).  

Each
time, while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower enters into a Section 3(a)(9) transaction (including but not limited to the
issuance of new promissory notes or of a replacement promissory note), or Section 3(a)(10) transaction, in which any 3rd party
has the right to convert monies owed to that 3rd party (or receive shares pursuant to a settlement or otherwise) at a discount
to market greater than the Variable Conversion Price in effect at that time (prior to all other applicable adjustments in the
Note), then the Variable Conversion Price shall be automatically adjusted to such greater discount percentage (prior to all applicable
adjustments in this Note) until this Note is no longer outstanding. Each time, while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower enters
into a Section 3(a)(9) transaction (including but not limited to the issuance of new promissory notes or of a replacement promissory
note), or Section 3(a)(10) transaction, in which any 3rd party has a look back period greater than the look back period in effect
under the Note at that time (currently a thirty (30) Trading Day look back period as described in this Section 1.2(a) applies),
then the Holder s look back period shall automatically be adjusted to such greater number of days until this Note is no
longer outstanding. The Borrower shall give written notice to the Holder, with the adjusted Variable Conversion Price and/or adjusted
look back period (each adjustment that is applicable due to the triggering event), within one (1) business day of an event that
requires any adjustment described in the two immediately preceding sentences.  

1.3
 Authorized Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists, the Borrower will reserve
from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance
of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved five
times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Notes
in effect from time to time)(the  Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance
with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital
structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current
Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Notes. The Borrower
(i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents
who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.  

If,
at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of
the Note.  

1.4
 Method of Conversion .  

(a)
 Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time
from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other
reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject
to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

(b)
 Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless
the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the
principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the
Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute
or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima facie,  be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest
error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this
Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and
deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and
any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following
conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be
less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

(c)
 Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved
in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other
than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other
securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such
shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount
of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid.  

(d)
 Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail
(or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in
this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder
certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within two (2) business days after such receipt (the  Deadline )
(and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with
the terms hereof.  

(e)
 Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall
be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the
amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults
on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith
terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such
conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue
and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by
the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against
any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower
to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by
the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation
of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall
be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time,
on such date.  

(f)
 Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast Automated
Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained
in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically
transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with
DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system.  

(g)
 Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other
remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3
above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $1,000 per day in cash, for each
day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the
fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower
by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note,
in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall
be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a
valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right
are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained
in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

1.5
 Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred
unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer
agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for
opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred
pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act
(or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate  (as defined in
Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who
is an Accredited Investor. Except as otherwise provided (and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time
as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold
pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately
sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective
registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits
removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate:  

NEITHER
THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN
A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE
144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT
OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.    

The
legend set forth above shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer
legend if (i) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary
for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made
without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Borrower so that the sale or transfer is effected or
(ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Borrower does
not accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from
registration, such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section
3.2 of the Note.  

1.6
 Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the principal securities market
on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant
to this Note more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal
United States securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share Amount ), which shall
be 4.99% of the total shares currently outstanding, subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof.
Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the
rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction
over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum
Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note, this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3
of the Note.  

1.7
 Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby (other than
the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s allocated portion of the Reserved
Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holder s rights as a
Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates for
such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because
of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received
certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration of the Deadline with respect
to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its status as a
holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Note with respect
to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Note to the
Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not been converted.
In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive
Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any subsequent
Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in accordance
with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.

of capital stock other than dividends on shares of Common Stock solely in the form of additional shares of Common Stock or (b)

Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares.

any written announcement, statement or threat not to honor its obligations shall not be rescinded in writing) for three (3) business
days after the Holder shall have delivered a Notice of Conversion. It is an obligation of the Borrower to remain current in its
obligations to its transfer agent. It shall be an event of default of this Note, if a conversion of this Note is delayed, hindered
or frustrated due to a balance owed by the Borrower to its transfer agent. If at the option of the Holder, the Holder advances
any funds to the Borrower s transfer agent in order to process a conversion, such advanced funds shall be paid by the Borrower

pay the principal hereof or interest thereon when due at the Maturity Date), the Note shall become immediately due and payable
and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the Default Sum

AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO: (Y) THE DEFAULT SUM (AS DEFINED HEREIN); MULTIPLIED BY (Z) TWO (2). Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of any Event of Default specified in Sections 3.1 (solely with respect to failure to pay the principal hereof or interest thereon
when due on this Note or upon acceleration), 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3,10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.17,
and/or 3.18 exercisable through the delivery of written notice to the Borrower by such Holders (the  Default Notice ),

principal hereof or interest thereon at the Maturity Date specified in Section 3,1 hereof), the Note shall become immediately
due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to
150%  multiplied by  the then outstanding entire balance of the Note (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest)

ARTICLE
IV. MISCELLANEOUS  

4.1
 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All rights and remedies existing hereunder
are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

NAME  

4.3
 Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the Borrower and
the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, shall mean this instrument
as originally executed, or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

4.4
 Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit
of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an  accredited investor  (as defined
in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary, this Note may be pledged as collateral
in connection with a bona fide margin account or other lending arrangement.  

4.5
 Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall pay the Holder hereof costs of collection,
including reasonable attorneys  fees.  

4.6
 Governing Law . This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions contemplated
by this Note shall be brought only in the state and/or federal courts of New York, NY. The parties to this Note hereby irrevocably
waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack
of jurisdiction or venue or based upon  forum non conveniens . The Borrower and Holder waive trial by jury. The prevailing
party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs. In the event that any
provision of this Note or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable
statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall
be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under
any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably
waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with
evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service
shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit
in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.  

4.7
 Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding
principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus Default Interest
on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on
this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents stipulated damages and not a penalty
and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note and to earn a return from the
sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant
to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate
to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert this Note into shares
of Common Stock.  

4.8
 Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the
Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges that
the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies
at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing
or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without the necessity of showing
economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

4.9
 Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, the Borrower may prepay any amount outstanding
under this Note, on or before the Maturity Date of this Note, by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to
125% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, the
Borrower may prepay any amount outstanding under this Note, after the Maturity Date of this Note, by making a payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash equal to 140% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying. In order to prepay this Note, the Borrower
shall provide notice to the Holder five (5) business days prior to such respective prepayment date, and the Holder must receive
such prepayment on or before the 10th business day after the Holder s receipt of the respective prepayment notice (the  Prepayment
Period ). The Holder may convert the Note in whole or in part at any time during the Prepayment Period. If the Borrower
fails to pay the applicable prepayment amount within any applicable Prepayment Period, then it shall automatically be deemed an
Event of Default under Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this Note.  

4.10
 Section 3(a)(10) Transactions . If at any time while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower enters into a transaction structured
in accordance with, based upon, or related or pursuant to, in whole or in part, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (a  3(a)(10)
Transaction ), then a liquidated damages charge of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of this Note at that time, will
be assessed and will become immediately due and payable to the Holder, either in the form of cash payment or as an addition to
the balance of the Note, as determined by mutual agreement of the Borrower and Holder.  

4.11
 Intentionally Omitted .  

4.12
 Right of First Refusal . If at any time while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower has a bona fide offer of capital or
financing from any 3rd party, that the Borrower intends to act upon, then the Borrower must first offer such opportunity to the
Holder to provide such capital or financing to the Borrower on the same terms as each respective 3rd party s terms. Should
the Holder be unwilling or unable to provide such capital or financing to the Borrower within 10 trading days from Holder s
receipt of written notice of the offer (the  Offer Notice ) from the Borrower, then the Borrower may obtain such capital
or financing from that respective 3rd party upon the exact same terms and conditions offered by the Borrower to the Holder, which
transaction must be completed within 30 days after the date of the Offer Notice. If the Borrower does not receive the capital
or financing from the respective 3rd party within 30 days after the date of the respective Offer Notice, then the Borrower must
again offer the capital or financing opportunity to the Holder as described above, and the process detailed above shall be repeated.
The Offer Notice must be sent via electronic email to:  

4.13
 Trading Limitation . Unless an Event of Default occurs under the Note, from the Issue Date and until the one year anniversary
after the Issue Date, the Holder shall only be permitted to sell, per Trading Day, up to the greater of (i) $1,000 or (ii) 6%
multiplied by the Aggregate Amount (as defined below) of the Common Stock. The Aggregate Amount shall mean the total number shares
of common stock of the Borrower traded during the respective Trading Day multiplied by the highest traded price for the Common
Stock during the respective Trading Day.  

4.14
 Purchase Price Consideration upon Public Offering or Private Placement . The Holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to
apply all, or any portion, of the outstanding principal and accrued interest due under this Note, as purchase consideration in
any future public offering or private placement of equity securities of the Borrower (each a  Future Transaction ).
The dollar amount of purchasing power in such private placement or public offering shall be equal to the portion of the outstanding
principal and accrued interest that Holder elects to apply multiplied by 1.25. The Borrower shall give written notice to Holder
as soon as practicable, but in no event less than fifteen (15) days before the anticipated closing date of such Future Transaction.

Buyer s right to rely on the Company s representations and warranties contained in Section 3 below. The Buyer understands
that its investment in the Securities involves a significant degree of risk. The Buyer is not aware of any facts that may constitute
a breach of any of the Company s representations and warranties made herein. 

d.  Governmental Review. 
The Buyer understands that no United States federal or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has passed upon
or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Securities. 

e.  Transfer or Re-sale. 
The Buyer understands that (i) the sale or re-sale of the Securities has not been and is not being registered under the 1933 Act
or any applicable state securities laws, and the Securities may not be transferred unless (a) the Securities are sold pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act, (b) the Buyer shall have delivered to the Company, at the cost of the
Buyer, an opinion of counsel that shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions
to the effect that the Securities to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration,
which opinion shall be accepted by the Company, (c) the Securities are sold or transferred to an  affiliate  (as defined
in Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 )) of the Buyer who agrees to sell or otherwise
transfer the Securities only in accordance with this Section 2(f) and who is an Accredited Investor, (d) the Securities are sold
pursuant to Rule 144, or (e) the Securities are sold pursuant to Regulation S under the 1933 Act (or a successor rule) ( Regulation
S ), and the Buyer shall have delivered to the Company, at the cost of the Buyer, an opinion of counsel that shall be in
form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in corporate transactions, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company;
(ii) any sale of such Securities made in reliance on Rule 144 may be made only in accordance with the terms of said Rule and further,
if said Rule is not applicable, any re-sale of such Securities under circumstances in which the seller (or the person through whom
the sale is made) may be deemed to be an underwriter (as that term is defined in the 1933 Act) may require compliance with some
other exemption under the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and (iii) neither the Company nor any other
person is under any obligation to register such Securities under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws or to comply with the
terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder (in each case). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained herein
to the contrary, the Securities may be pledged as collateral in connection with a  bona fide  margin account or other lending
arrangement. 

f.  Legends . The
Buyer understands that the Note and, until such time as the Conversion Shares have been registered under the 1933 Act may be sold
pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then
be immediately sold, the Conversion Shares may bear a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer
order may be placed against transfer of the certificates for such Securities): 

NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE
OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE,
SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE
FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING
THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT
SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.   

The legend set forth above
shall be removed and the Company shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder of any Security upon which it is stamped,
if, unless otherwise required by applicable state securities laws, (a) such Security is registered for sale under an effective
registration statement filed under the 1933 Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, or (b) such holder provides the Company
with an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect
that a public sale or transfer of such Security may be made without registration under the 1933 Act, which opinion shall be accepted
by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected. The Buyer agrees to sell all Securities, including those represented by
a certificate(s) from which the legend has been removed, in compliance with applicable prospectus delivery requirements, if any.
In the event that the Company does not accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities
pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of
Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note. 

g.  Authorization; Enforcement. 
This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Buyer,
and this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Buyer enforceable in accordance with its terms.

and other) to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to carry on its business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated
and conducted. Schedule 3(a) sets forth a list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the jurisdiction in which each is
incorporated. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership or use of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 Material Adverse Effect  means any material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, financial condition
or prospects of the Company or its Subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
agreements or instruments to be entered into in connection herewith.  Subsidiaries  means any corporation or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, any equity or other ownership
interest.

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and to issue the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof,
(ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Note by the Company and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including without limitation, the issuance of the Note and the issuance and reservation for issuance of the
Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof) have been duly authorized by the Company s Board of Directors
and no further consent or authorization of the Company, its Board of Directors, or its shareholders is required, (iii) this Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company by its authorized representative, and such authorized representative is the
true and official representative with authority to sign this Agreement and the other documents executed in connection herewith
and bind the Company accordingly, and (iv) this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery by the Company of the Note,
each of such instruments will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms. 

c.  Capitalization .
Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, no shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company s stock option plans,
no shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to securities (other than the Note) exercisable for, or convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock and sufficient shares are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Note (as required by the Note
and transfer agent share reserve letter). All of such outstanding shares of capital stock are, or upon issuance will be, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. No shares of capital stock of the Company are subject to preemptive rights or any
other similar rights of the shareholders of the Company or any liens or encumbrances imposed through the actions or failure to
act of the Company. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, as of the effective date of this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding
options, warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe for, puts, calls, rights of first refusal, agreements, understandings, claims or
other commitments or rights of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for
any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or arrangements by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is or may become bound to issue additional shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) there are no
agreements or arrangements under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to register the sale of any of its or
their securities under the 1933 Act and (iii) there are no anti-dilution or price adjustment provisions contained in any security
issued by the Company (or in any agreement providing rights to security holders) that will be triggered by the issuance of the
Note or the Conversion Shares. The Company has filed in its SEC Documents true and correct copies of the Company s Certificate
of Incorporation as in effect on the date hereof ( Certificate of Incorporation ), the Company s By-laws, as
in effect on the date hereof (the  By-laws ), and the terms of all securities convertible into or exercisable for Common
Stock of the Company and the material rights of the holders thereof in respect thereto. The Company shall provide the Buyer with
a written update of this representation signed by the Company s Chief Executive on behalf of the Company as of the Closing
Date. 

d.  Issuance of Shares. 
The Conversion Shares are duly authorized and reserved for issuance and, upon conversion of the Note in accordance with its respective
terms, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect
to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Company and will
not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

e.  Acknowledgment of
Dilution.  The Company understands and acknowledges the potentially dilutive effect to the Common Stock upon the issuance of
the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the Note. The Company further acknowledges that its obligation to issue Conversion Shares
upon conversion of the Note in accordance with this Agreement, the Note is absolute and unconditional regardless of the dilutive
effect that such issuance may have on the ownership interests of other shareholders of the Company. 

f.  No Conflicts. 
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Note by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance and reservation for issuance of the Conversion Shares)
will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or (ii) violate
or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both could become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, any agreement, indenture, patent, patent license or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state securities
laws and regulations and regulations of any self-regulatory organizations to which the Company or its securities are subject) applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or affected (except for such conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other organizational documents and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in default (and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both could put the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in default) under, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action that would
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is bound or affected, except for possible defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
The businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, are not being conducted, and shall not be conducted so long as the
Buyer owns any of the Securities, in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any governmental entity. Except as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement and as required under the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws, the Company is not
required to obtain any consent, authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court, governmental agency,
regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization or stock market or any third party in order for it to execute, deliver or perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement, the Note in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof or to issue and sell the Note
in accordance with the terms hereof and to issue the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the Note. All consents, authorizations,
orders, filings and registrations which the Company is required to obtain pursuant to the preceding sentence have been obtained
or effected on or prior to the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of the listing requirements of the Over-the- Counter
Bulletin Board (the  OTCBB ), the OTCQB or any similar quotation system, and does not reasonably anticipate that the
Common Stock will be delisted by the OTCBB, the OTCQB or any similar quotation system, in the foreseeable future. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing. 

g.  SEC Documents; Financial
Statements.  The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed
by it with the SEC pursuant to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  1934 Act )
(all of the foregoing filed prior to the date hereof and all exhibits included therein and financial statements and schedules thereto
and documents (other than exhibits to such documents) incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to herein as
the  SEC Documents ). The Company has delivered to the Buyer true and complete copies of the SEC Documents, except
for such exhibits and incorporated documents. As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the SEC Documents,
and none of the SEC Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the statements made in any such SEC Documents is, or has been, required to
be amended or updated under applicable law (except for such statements as have been amended or updated in subsequent filings prior
the date hereof). As of their respective dates, the financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents complied
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied, during the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).
Except as set forth in the financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents, the Company has no liabilities, contingent
or otherwise, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) obligations under contracts and
commitments incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected
in such financial statements, which, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to the financial condition or operating
results of the Company. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act. For the avoidance of doubt, filing
of the documents required in this Section 3(g) via the SEC s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ( EDGAR )
shall satisfy all delivery requirements of this Section 3(g). 

h.  Absence of Certain
Changes.  There have been no material adverse change and no material adverse development in the assets, liabilities, business,
properties, operations, financial condition, results of operations, prospects or 1934 Act reporting status of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. 

i.  Absence of Litigation. 
There is no action, suit, claim, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against
or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their officers or directors in their capacity as such, that could have
a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3(i) contains a complete list and summary description of any pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened proceeding against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without regard to whether it would
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise
to any of the foregoing. 

j.  Patents, Copyrights,
etc.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses the requisite licenses or rights to use all patents, patent
applications, patent rights, inventions, know-how, trade secrets, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, service names,
trade names and copyrights ( Intellectual Property ) necessary to enable it to conduct its business as now operated
(and, as presently contemplated to be operated in the future); Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, there is no claim or action
by any person pertaining to, or proceeding pending, or to the Company s knowledge threatened, which challenges the right
of the Company or of a Subsidiary with respect to any Intellectual Property necessary to enable it to conduct its business as now
operated (and, as presently contemplated to be operated in the future); to the best of the Company s knowledge, the Company s
or its Subsidiaries  current and intended products, services and processes do not infringe on any Intellectual Property or
other rights held by any person; and the Company is unaware of any facts or circumstances which might give rise to any of the foregoing.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value
of their Intellectual Property. 

k.  No Materially Adverse
Contracts, Etc.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any charter, corporate or other legal restriction,
or any judgment, decree, order, rule or regulation which in the judgment of the Company s officers has or is expected in
the future to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement
which in the judgment of the Company s officers has or is expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

l.  Tax Status.  The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all federal, state and foreign income and all other tax returns, reports
and declarations required by any jurisdiction to which it is subject (unless and only to the extent that the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has set aside on its books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and unreported taxes)

on such returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith and has set aside on its books provisions
reasonably adequate for the payment of all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns, reports or declarations
apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the
officers of the Company know of no basis for any such claim. The Company has not executed a waiver with respect to the statute
of limitations relating to the assessment or collection of any foreign, federal, state or local tax. None of the Company s
tax returns is presently being audited by any taxing authority. 

m.  Certain Transactions. 
Except for arm s length transactions pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes payments in the ordinary
course of business upon terms no less favorable than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could obtain from third parties and
other than the grant of stock options disclosed on Schedule 3(c), none of the officers, directors, or employees of the Company
is presently a party to any transaction with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for services as employees, officers
and directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing
for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any officer, director or such employee
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any officer, director, or any
such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner.

pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof and otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is true and correct in all
material respects and the Company has not omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made herein
or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No event or circumstance has occurred or
exists with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their business, properties, prospects, operations or financial
conditions, which, under applicable law, rule or regulation, requires public disclosure or announcement by the Company but which
has not been so publicly announced or disclosed (assuming for this purpose that the Company s reports filed under the 1934
Act are being incorporated into an effective registration statement filed by the Company under the 1933 Act).

Buyer  Purchase of Securities.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer is acting solely in the capacity of
arm s length purchasers with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company further acknowledges
that the Buyer is not acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in any similar capacity) with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and any statement made by the Buyer or any of its respective representatives
or agents in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is not advice or a recommendation and is merely
incidental to the Buyer  purchase of the Securities. The Company further represents to the Buyer that the Company s

Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf, has directly or indirectly made any
offers or sales in any security or solicited any offers to buy any security under circumstances that would require registration
under the 1933 Act of the issuance of the Securities to the Buyer. The issuance of the Securities to the Buyer will not be integrated
with any other issuance of the Company s securities (past, current or future) for purposes of any shareholder approval provisions
applicable to the Company or its securities. 

q.  No Brokers.  The
Company has taken no action which would give rise to any claim by any person for brokerage commissions, transaction fees or similar
payments relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

r.  Permits; Compliance. 
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,

on its business as it is now being conducted (collectively, the  Company Permits ), and there is no action pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened regarding suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any of the Company Permits, except for
any such conflicts, defaults or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification with respect to possible
conflicts, defaults or violations of applicable laws, except for notices relating to possible conflicts, defaults or violations,
which conflicts, defaults or violations would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

s.  Environmental Matters.  

(i) There are, to the Company s
knowledge, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor of the Company, no past or present violations
of Environmental Laws (as defined below), releases of any material into the environment, actions, activities, circumstances, conditions,
events, incidents, or contractual obligations which may give rise to any common law environmental liability or any liability under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or similar federal, state, local or foreign laws
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice with respect to any of the foregoing, nor is any action
pending or, to the Company s knowledge, threatened in connection with any of the foregoing. The term  Environmental
Laws  means all federal, state, local or foreign laws relating to pollution or protection of human health or the environment
(including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface or subsurface strata), including, without
limitation, laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of chemicals, pollutants contaminants, or toxic
or hazardous substances or wastes (collectively,  Hazardous Materials ) into the environment, or otherwise relating
to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials,
as well as all authorizations, codes, decrees, demands or demand letters, injunctions, judgments, licenses, notices or notice letters,
orders, permits, plans or regulations issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder. 

(ii) Other than those that
are or were stored, used or disposed of in compliance with applicable law, no Hazardous Materials are contained on or about any
real property currently owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no Hazardous Materials were released
on or about any real property previously owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the period the
property was owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the normal course of the Company s
or any of its Subsidiaries  business. 

(iii) There are no underground
storage tanks on or under any real property owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not in compliance
with applicable law. 

t.  Title to Property. 
Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title in fee simple to all real
property and good and marketable title to all personal property owned by them which is material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects or such as would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Any real property and facilities held under lease by the Company and its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting
and enforceable leases with such exceptions as would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 

u.  Internal Accounting
Controls.  Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents the Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient, in the judgment of the Company s board of directors, to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with management s general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset
accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management s general or specific authorization
and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action
is taken with respect to any differences. 

v.  Foreign Corrupt Practices. 
Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent, employee or other person acting on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary has, in the course of his actions for, or on behalf of, the Company, used any corporate funds for
any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity; made any direct or indirect
unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee from corporate funds; violated or is in violation of
any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or made any bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment,
kickback or other unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government official or employee. 

w.  Solvency . The
Company (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) is solvent ( i.e.,  its assets have a fair
market value in excess of the amount required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and
matured) and currently the Company has no information that would lead it to reasonably conclude that the Company would not, after
giving effect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, have the ability to, nor does it intend to take any action that
would impair its ability to, pay its debts from time to time incurred in connection therewith as such debts mature. The Company
did not receive a qualified opinion from its auditors with respect to its most recent fiscal year end and, after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, does not anticipate or know of any basis upon which its auditors might issue
a qualified opinion in respect of its current fiscal year. For the avoidance of doubt any disclosure of the Borrower s ability
to continue as a  going concern  shall not, by itself, be a violation of this Section 3(w). 

x.  No Investment Company. 
The Company is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement will not be an  investment
company  required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (an  Investment Company ). The Company
is not controlled by an Investment Company. 

y.  Insurance . Upon
written request the Company will provide to the Buyer true and correct copies of all policies relating to directors  and
officers  liability coverage, errors and omissions coverage, and commercial general liability coverage, if any. 

z.  Breach of Representations
and Warranties by the Company.  If the Company breaches any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Section 3,

under Section 3.4 of the Note. 

4.  COVENANTS . 

a.  Best Efforts .
The parties shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to satisfy timely each of the conditions described in Section
6 and 7 of this Agreement. 

b.  Use of Proceeds. 
The Company shall use the proceeds from the sale of the Note for working capital and other general corporate purposes and shall

with the making available or giving to the shareholders of the Company, copies of any notices or other information the Company
makes available or gives to such shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, filing the documents required in (i) above via EDGAR
or releasing any documents set forth in (ii) above via a recognized wire service shall satisfy the delivery requirements of this
Section 4(f). 

d.  Listing.  The
Company shall promptly secure the listing of the Conversion Shares upon each national securities exchange or automated quotation
system, if any, upon which shares of Common Stock are then listed (subject to official notice of issuance) and, so long as the
Buyer owns any of the Securities, shall maintain, so long as any other shares of Common Stock shall be so listed, such listing
of all Conversion Shares from time to time issuable upon conversion of the Note. The Company will obtain and, so long as the Buyer
owns any of the Securities, maintain the listing and trading of its Common Stock on the OTCBB, OTCQB, OTC Pink or any equivalent
replacement exchange, the Nasdaq National Market ( Nasdaq ), the Nasdaq SmallCap Market ( Nasdaq SmallCap ),
the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ), or the NYSE MKT and will comply in all respects with the Company s reporting,
filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) and
such exchanges, as applicable. The Company shall promptly provide to the Buyer copies of any material notices it receives from
the OTCBB, OTCQB and any other exchanges or quotation systems on which the Common Stock is then listed regarding the continued
eligibility of the Common Stock for listing on such exchanges and quotation systems. 

e.  Corporate Existence. 
So long as the Buyer beneficially owns any Note, the Company shall maintain its corporate existence and shall not sell all or substantially
all of the Company s assets, except in the event of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
Company s assets, where the surviving or successor entity in such transaction (i) assumes the Company s obligations
hereunder and under the agreements and instruments entered into in connection herewith and (ii) is a publicly traded corporation
whose Common Stock is listed for trading on the OTCBB, OTCQB, OTC Pink, Nasdaq, NasdaqSmallCap, NYSE or AMEX. 

f.  No Integration. 
The Company shall not make any offers or sales of any security (other than the Securities) under circumstances that would require
registration of the Securities being offered or sold hereunder under the 1933 Act or cause the offering of the Securities to be
integrated with any other offering of securities by the Company for the purpose of any stockholder approval provision applicable
to the Company or its securities. 

g.  Failure to Comply
with the 1934 Act.  So long as the Buyer beneficially owns the Note, the Company shall comply with the reporting requirements
of the 1934 Act; and the Company shall continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act. 

h.  Trading Activities. 
Neither the Buyer nor its affiliates has an open short position (or other hedging or similar transactions) in the common stock
of the Company and the Buyer agree that it shall not, and that it will cause its affiliates not to, engage in any short sales of
or hedging transactions with respect to the common stock of the Company. 

i.  Breach of Covenants. 
If the Company breaches any of the covenants set forth in this Section 4, and in addition to any other remedies available to the
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, it will be considered an event of default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

5.  Transfer Agent Instructions. 
Prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act or the date on which the Conversion Shares may be sold pursuant
to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of Securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, all
such certificates shall bear the restrictive legend specified in Section 2(g) of this Agreement. The Company warrants that: (i)
no stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(f) hereof (in the case of the Conversion Shares, prior to registration
of the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act or the date on which the Conversion Shares may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without
any restriction as to the number of Securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold), will be given by the
Company to its transfer agent and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the Company
as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Note; (ii) it will not direct its transfer agent not to transfer or delay,
impair, and/or hinder its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing) (electronically or in certificated form) any certificate
for Conversion Shares to be issued to the Buyer upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the Note as and when required by the
Note and this Agreement; and (iii) it will not fail to remove (or directs its transfer agent not to remove or impairs, delays,
and/or hinders its transfer agent from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect
thereof) on any certificate for any Conversion Shares issued to the Buyer upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the Note
as and when required by the Note and this Agreement. Nothing in this Section shall affect in any way the Buyer s obligations
and agreement set forth in Section 2(g) hereof to comply with all applicable prospectus delivery requirements, if any, upon re-sale
of the Securities. If the Buyer provides the Company, at the cost of the Buyer, with (i) an opinion of counsel in form, substance
and scope customary for opinions in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Securities may
be made without registration under the 1933 Act and such sale or transfer is effected or (ii) the Buyer provides reasonable assurances
that the Securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall permit the transfer, and, in the case of the Conversion
Shares, promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates, free from restrictive legend, in such name and
in such denominations as specified by the Buyer. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will
cause irreparable harm to the Buyer, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section may be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this Section, that the Buyer shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate transfer, without
the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all

    presented in this report;   

4.

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,

    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The
    registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
    over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting.
