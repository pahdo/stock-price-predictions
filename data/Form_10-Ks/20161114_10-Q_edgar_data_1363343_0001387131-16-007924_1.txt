   For
The Three AND NINE months ended SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 and 2015   

Organization and Business Nature  

 USA Zhimingde International Group
Corporation (formerly, Marketing Acquisition Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated on July 26, 1990 in accordance
with the laws of the State of Florida as Marketing Educational Corp. On June 13, 2006, the Company was reincorporated by merger
in the State of Nevada. 

 The Company was originally formed
for the purpose of direct marketing of certain educational materials and photography packages. During 1991, the Company completed
a public offering of 150,000 units of common stock, through a Registration Statement on Form S-18 (Registration No.33-37039-A). 

 The Company has had no operations
since 1992 and is currently a  shell company  as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities
Act ) and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ). The Company is defined as a
shell company because it has no operations or assets. 

 On December 7, 2012, USA Zhimingde
International Group Inc., a New Jersey corporation ( Zhimingde Inc. ) purchased 1,687,502 shares of the Company s
common stock from Halter Financial Investments, L.P., Glenn A. Little and The Halter Group, Inc. pursuant to a Securities Purchase
Agreement (the  Purchase ). Following the Purchase, Zhimingde Inc. owned approximately 91% of the voting securities
of the Company. The Purchase resulted in a change in control of the Company. Subsequently, the Company changed its name to USA
Zhimingde International Group Corporation effective on February 4, 2013. 

2.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

  Basis of Accounting and Presentation   

 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. 

 The unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations
of the SEC which apply to interim financial statements.

2.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

  Basis of Accounting and Presentation (Continued)

Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The interim financial information
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed
with the SEC. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for future quarters or for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

 All financial statements and notes
to the financial statements are presented in United States dollars ( US Dollar  or  US$  or  $ ). 

  Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any cash equivalents. 

  Income Taxes  

 The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Section 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences
between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities
are recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future
taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. 

 The Company accounts for uncertain
tax positions in accordance with ASC Section 740-10, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The guidance also prescribes
direction on de-recognition, classification, interest and payables accounting in financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company classifies interest expense and any related penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income
tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recognized as of September 30, 2016.

The Three AND nine months ended september 30, 2016 and 2015   

2.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

  Income Taxes (Continued)  

 Management has evaluated and concluded
that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s financial statements as of September
30, 2016. The Company does not expect any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting
date. 

  Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. 

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 The Company measures the fair
value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

 ASC 820 defines fair value as
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC
820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value: 

Level 1 -  
      quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   

Level 2 -   
      inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.    

Level 3 -  
      inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value markets.    
 
 The carrying amounts of the
Company s liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

  ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

  Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

 Basic earnings (loss) per common
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
plus common stock equivalents, if dilutive, resulting from convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding. 

3.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    

 In August 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses
the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain
debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain
insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption
must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated
statement of cash flows. 

 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured
at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted
from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application
permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

 In May, 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which is an amendment
to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, to allow entities to exclude amounts collected
from customers from all sales taxes from the transaction price, to specify the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract
inception, variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration,
and clarification on contract modifications at transition. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09.

  RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)  

 In April, 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is an amendment
to ASU No. 2014-09 that clarifies the aspects of identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementing guidance, while
retaining the related principles within those areas. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09. 

 In March, 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue with Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus net),
which is an amendment to ASU No. 2014-09 that improved the operability and understandability of implementation guidance versus
agent considerations by clarifying the determination of principal versus agent. The implementation guidelines follow ASU No. 2014-09. 

 In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). ASU 2016-06 clarifies
that determining whether the economic characteristics of a put or call are clearly and closely related to its debt host requires
only an assessment of the four-step decision sequence outlined in FASB ASC paragraph 815-15-25-24. Additionally, entities are not
required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related. The standard is effective for public
business entities in interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted
in any interim period for which the entity s financial statements have not been issued, but would be retroactively applied
to the beginning of the year that includes the interim period. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach,
with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. For instruments that are eligible
for the fair value option, an entity has a one-time option to irrevocably elect to measure the debt instrument affected by the
standard in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company does not expect the application
of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations or Consolidated Statements
of Condition.

  RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)  

 In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of
Accounting. This new guidance effectively removes the retroactive application imposed in current guidance when an investment qualifies
for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments
require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis
of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes
qualified for equity method accounting. The new standard becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is
permissible. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

 In March 2016, the FASB Issued
ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The updated
guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting
for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.
The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is evaluating
the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires
a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases
will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income
statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements. 

 In January 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning
June 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  INCOME
TAXES (CONTINUED)  

 Deferred tax assets (liabilities)
are comprised of the following: 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had approximately $348,000 of Federal net operating losses that may be available to offset future taxable income. The Federal net
operating loss carryover, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2026. The amount and availability of any future net operating
loss carry-forwards may be subject to limitations set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. Based upon an analysis of the Company s
stock ownership activity through December 31, 2012, a change of ownership was deemed to have occurred in 2012. This change of ownership
created an annual limitation of substantially all of the Company s net operating losses which are available through 2031. 

 The Company assesses the likelihood
that deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is established.
Based upon the Company s losses since inception, management believes that it is more likely than not that future benefits
of deferred tax assets will not be realized principally due to the change of ownership limitations and has therefore established
a full valuation allowance. The valuation allowance were $4,283 and $4,636 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $12,849 and $16,761 for the nine months ended September 30 2016 and 2015. 

 No provision for income taxes
in the United States has been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.

   For

6.     Going concern     

 The Company has not generated
any revenue, and has had no significant operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not
have any assets as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency and stockholders 
deficiency of $122,134. The Company continues to incur losses from operations and has incurred a net loss of $10,198 and $11,039
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $30,594 and $39,907 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 The Company s current business
plan is to seek an acquisition or merger with a private operating company. However, there is no assurance that the Company will
be able to successfully consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating company or, that the Company will identify
any debt or equity financing sources to finance a potential acquisition or merger. If unable to obtain financing, the Company may
be unable to complete its business plan, and would, instead, delay all cash intensive activities. The Company will continue to
be dependent on additional capital contributions from its major stockholder for cash flow, which may not be available. Without
necessary cash flow, the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or until such time as necessary funds could
be raised. 

 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to
represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

ITEM 2.    

 MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

   Results of Operations   

 We currently have
no assets and no operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we realized no revenue and incurred $10,198
and $30,594, respectively, in operating expenses, resulting in losses from operations and net losses in those amounts. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we realized no revenue and incurred $11,039 and $39,907, respectively, in operating
expenses, resulting in losses from operations and net losses in those amounts. The greater expenses in the nine months ended September
30, 2015 occurred because, during the first quarter of 2015, we filed with the SEC our annual and quarterly reports for all periods
from the second quarter of 2013 through the third quarter of 2014, and incurred the expenses related to those filings. We now plan
to stay current in our filing obligations, and do not expect to replicate the level of those expenses until we acquire an operating
business. 

 Our major expenses
consisted of fees to lawyers and auditors necessary to maintain our standing as a fully-reporting public company and other administrative
expenses attendant to the trading of our common stock. We do not expect the level of our operating expenses to change in the future
until we undertake to effect an acquisition. 

 Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

 At September 30,
2016 we had a working capital deficit of $122,134, as we had no assets and had $122,134 in accrued expenses. Our accrued liabilities
consist of amounts payable to our professional advisors for services, which increased by $17,594 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The remainder of our operating expenses during that nine month period were paid with funds contributed by USA Zhimingde
International Group Inc., which is our majority shareholder, or by affiliates of that entity. We expect our working capital deficit
to continue indefinitely, until we initiate or obtain an operating company capable of funding our overhead expenses. 

 Our operations used
$13,000 in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as we increased our accrued expenses by $17,594 during that period
and received the remainder of our cash requirements as a capital contribution from our majority shareholder. Our operations used
$14,473 in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we increased our accrued expenses by $25,434 and received the
remainder of our operating expenses as a capital contribution. In the future, unless we achieve the financial and/or operational
wherewithal to sustain our operations, it is likely that we will continue to rely on loans and capital contributions to sustain
our operations. 

 In December 2012,
control of USA Zhimingde International Group Corporation was transferred to USA Zhimingde International Group, Inc., which is controlled
by Zhongquan Zou, our Chief Executive Officer. The majority shareholder, or other entities that Mr. Zou controls, have financed
our operations by making capital contributions to cover our expenses. We expect that Mr. Zou s controlled affiliates will
continue to fund our operations until we have completed an acquisition of an operating company, and that we will continue to require
additional capital contributions or financing to maintain our existence as a shell company for the next twelve months, if necessary.  Our
management is not required to fund our operations by any contract or other obligation. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

    ITEM 3     

  QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 Not applicable. 

    ITEM 4     

  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

  Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission) as of September 30, 2016. The evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our
disclosure controls, specifically: 

There are no management controls, as a single person functions as sole officer and sole member
of the Board of Directors.   

Having only one individual responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties
within our internal control system.   

Most of our accounting functions are outsourced, which limits our ability to assure that our accounting
policies are applied consistently.   

 Based on his evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s system of disclosure controls and procedures
was not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

  Changes in Internal
Controls . There was no change in internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation described in the preceding paragraph that occurred
during the Company s third fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.
