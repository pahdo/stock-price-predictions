Notes to Condensed Financial Statements     September 30, 2016     (Unaudited)         NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION         The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the period.       Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.         NOTE 2 GOING CONCERN         The Company does not have any assets, nor has it established operations, and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. It is the intent of the Company to seek a merger with an existing, well-capitalized operating company. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.         NOTE 3 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS         The Company had expenses and payables paid in its behalf by shareholders in the amount of $6,228 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The balance due to shareholders is $137,320 and $131,092 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  The aggregate amount of related party loans is non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand.  However, the Company imputes interest on the loan at 10% per annum.  Imputed interest expense on related party loans for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $4,951 and $4,181, respectively.          NOTE 4 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS          In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ( ASU No. 2014-09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The update is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The impact on the Company s financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-15 is currently being assessed by management.       In August 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,  addressing eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and for interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.       The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operation, financial position or cash flows.  Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.        NOTE 5 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        For purposes of these financial statements and all disclosures, subsequent events were evaluated through the date the financial statements were issued.         6          Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         Forward-looking Statements        Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words  may,   would,   could,   should,   expects,   projects,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   plans,   intends,   targets  or similar expressions.       Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters.       Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.  We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.        Plan of Operation        Our Company s plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which our Company may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in business in any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a going concern engaged in any industry selected.       During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing; the payment of our Securities and Exchange Commission and the Securities and Exchange of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), reporting requirement filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; costs incident to reviewing or investigating any potential business venture; and maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization.  Because a principal shareholder has been paying all of the operating expenses, management does not anticipate that we will have to raise additional funds during the next 12 months.       Our common stock currently trades on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets under the symbol BLKE.        Results of Operations         Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        We had no operations during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing.  General and administrative expenses were $6,228 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to $6,851 for the September 30, 2015, period. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were comprised mainly of accounting and Edgar filing expenses, along with other office fees. We had a net loss of $11,179 for the September 30, 2016, period, compared to a net loss of $11,032 for the September 30, 2015, period.  The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in interest expense.        Liquidity and Capital Requirements        We had no cash or cash equivalents on hand at September 30, 2016. If additional funds are required, such funds may be advanced by management or shareholders as loans to us.  During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, expenses and payables were paid by shareholders in the amount of $6,228, and during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2015, additional expenses paid by a principal shareholder totaled $775. The aggregate amount of related party loans is non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. However, the Company imputes interest on the loan at 10% per annum.  Imputed interest expense on related party loans for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled $4,951 and $4,181, respectively.  Because we have not identified any acquisition or venture, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan.              7          Off-balance Sheet Arrangements        None.        Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.        Not required.        Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Secretary, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Secretary, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  Based upon that evaluation, our President and Secretary concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting         During the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting .          PART II - OTHER INFORMATION            Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        None.         Item 1A. Risk Factors.        Not required.        Item 2.
