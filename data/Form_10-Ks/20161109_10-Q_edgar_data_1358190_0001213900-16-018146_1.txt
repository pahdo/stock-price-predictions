Organization and Business Background   

Orient
Paper, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2005, under the name  Carlateral, Inc.  Through
the steps described immediately below, we became the holding company for Hebei Baoding Orient Paper Milling Company Limited ( Orient
Paper HB ), a producer and distributor of paper products in China, on October 29, 2007, and effective December 21, 2007,
we changed our name to  Orient Paper, Inc.  to more accurately describe our business.  

On
October 29, 2007, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the  Merger Agreement ), the Company acquired Dongfang
Zhiye Holding Limited ( Dongfang Holding ), a corporation formed on November 13, 2006 under the laws of the British
Virgin Islands, and issued the shareholders of Dongfang Holding an aggregate of 7,450,497 (as adjusted for a four-for-one reverse
stock split effected in November 2009) shares of our common stock, which shares were distributed pro-rata to the shareholders
of Dongfang Holding in accordance with their respective ownership interests in Dongfang Holding. At the time of the Merger Agreement,
Dongfang Holding owned all of the issued and outstanding stock and ownership of Orient Paper HB and such shares of Orient Paper
HB were held in trust with Zhenyong Liu, Xiaodong Liu and Shuangxi Zhao, for Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhao (the original shareholders
of Orient Paper HB) to exercise control over the disposition of Dongfang Holding s shares in Orient Paper HB on Dongfang
Holding s behalf until Dongfang Holding successfully completed the change in registration of Orient Paper HB s capital
with the relevant PRC Administration of Industry and Commerce as the 100% owner of Orient Paper HB s shares. As a result
of the merger transaction, Dongfang Holding became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Dongfang Holding s wholly
owned subsidiary, Orient Paper HB, became an indirectly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

Dongfang
Holding, as the 100% owner of Orient Paper HB, was unable to complete the registration of Orient Paper HB s capital under
its name within the proper time limits set forth under PRC law. In connection with the consummation of the restructuring transactions
described below, Dongfang Holding directed the trustees to return the shares of Orient Paper HB to their original shareholders,
and the original Orient Paper HB shareholders entered into certain agreements with Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd. ( Orient
Paper Shengde ) to transfer the control of Orient Paper HB over to Orient Paper Shengde.  

On
June 24, 2009, the Company consummated a number of restructuring transactions pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Shengde Holdings Inc, a Nevada corporation. Shengde Holdings Inc was incorporated in the State of Nevada
on February 25, 2009. On June 1, 2009, Shengde Holdings Inc incorporated Orient Paper Shengde, a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the PRC. Because Orient Paper Shengde is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shengde Holdings Inc, it is regarded as
a wholly foreign-owned entity under PRC law.  

ORIENT
PAPER, INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (Unaudited)   

To
ensure proper compliance of the Company s control over the ownership and operations of Orient Paper HB with certain PRC
regulations, on June 24, 2009, the Company entered into a series of contractual agreements (the  Contractual Agreements )
with Orient Paper HB and Orient Paper HB Equity Owners via the Company s wholly owned subsidiary Shengde Holdings Inc ( Shengde
Holdings ) a Nevada corporation and Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd. ( Orient Paper Shengde ), a wholly foreign-owned
enterprise in the PRC with an original registered capital of $10,000,000 (subsequently increased to $60,000,000 in June 2010).
Orient Paper Shengde is mainly engaged in production and distribution of digital photo paper and is 100% owned by Shengde Holdings.
Prior to February 10, 2010, the Contractual Agreements included (i) Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement,
which generally provides that Orient Paper Shengde shall provide exclusive technical, business and management consulting services
to Orient Paper HB, in exchange for service fees including a fee equivalent to 80% of Orient Paper HB s total annual net
profits; (ii) Loan Agreement, which provides that Orient Paper Shengde will make a loan in the aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000
to Orient Paper HB Equity Owners in exchange for each such shareholder agreeing to contribute all of its proceeds from the loan
to the registered capital of Orient Paper HB; (iii) Call Option Agreement, which generally provides, among other things, that
Orient Paper HB Equity Owners irrevocably grant to Orient Paper Shengde an option to purchase all or part of each owner s
equity interest in Orient Paper HB. The exercise price for the options shall be RMB1 which Orient Paper Shengde should pay to
each of Orient Paper HB Equity Owner for all their equity interests in Orient Paper HB; (iv) Share Pledge Agreement, which provides
that Orient Paper HB Equity Owners will pledge all of their equity interests in Orient Paper HB to Orient Paper Shengde as security
for their obligations under the other agreements described in this section. Specifically, Orient Paper Shengde is entitled to
dispose of the pledged equity interests in the event that Orient Paper HB Equity Owners breach their obligations under the Loan
Agreement or Orient Paper HB fails to pay the service fees to Orient Paper Shengde pursuant to the Exclusive Technical Service
and Business Consulting Agreement; and (v) Proxy Agreement, which provides that Orient Paper HB Equity Owners shall irrevocably
entrust a designee of Orient Paper Shengde with such shareholder s voting rights and the right to represent such shareholder
to exercise such owner s rights at any equity owners  meeting of Orient Paper HB or with respect to any equity owner
action to be taken in accordance with the laws and Orient Paper HB s Articles of Association. The terms of the agreement
are binding on the parties for as long as Orient Paper HB Equity Owners continue to hold any equity interest in Orient Paper HB.
An Orient Paper HB Equity Owner will cease to be a party to the agreement once it transfers its equity interests with the prior
approval of Orient Paper Shengde. As the Company had controlled Orient Paper HB since July 16, 2007 through Dongfang Holding and
the trust until June 24, 2009, and continues to control Orient Paper HB through Orient Paper Shengde and the Contractual Agreements,
the execution of the Contractual Agreements is considered as a business combination under common control.  

On
February 10, 2010, Orient Paper Shengde and the Orient Paper HB Equity Owners entered into a Termination of Loan Agreement to
terminate the above $10,000,000 Loan Agreement. Because of the Company s decision to fund future business expansions through
Orient Paper Shengde instead of Orient Paper HB, the $10,000,000 loan contemplated was never made prior to the point of termination.
The parties believe the termination of the Loan Agreement does not in itself compromise the effective control of the Company over
Orient Paper HB and its businesses in the PRC.  

An
agreement was also entered into among Orient Paper Shengde, Orient Paper HB and the Orient Paper HB Equity Owners on December
31, 2010, reiterating that Orient Paper Shengde is entitled to 100% of the distributable profit of Orient Paper HB, pursuant to
the above mentioned Contractual Agreements. In addition, Orient Paper HB and the Orient Paper HB Equity Owners shall not declare
any of Orient Paper HB s unappropriated earnings as dividend, including the unappropriated earnings of Orient Paper HB from
its establishment to 2010 and thereafter.  

Orient
Paper has no direct equity interest in Orient Paper HB. However, through the Contractual Agreements described above Orient Paper
is found to be the primary beneficiary (the  Primary Beneficiary ) of Orient Paper HB and is deemed to have the effective
control over Orient Paper HB s activities that most significantly affect its economic performance, resulting in Orient Paper
HB being treated as a controlled variable interest entity of Orient Paper in accordance with Topic 810 - Consolidation of the
Accounting Standards Codification (the  ASC ) issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (the  FASB ).
The revenue of the Company generated from Orient Paper HB for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 99.83% and
99.53%, respectively. The revenue of the Company generated from Orient Paper HB for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were 99.36% and 99.82%, respectively. Orient Paper HB also accounted for 86.1% and 85.96% of the total assets of the Company
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Orient Paper HB is treated as a 100% controlled variable interest entity of the Company  

However,
uncertainties in the PRC legal system could cause the Company s current ownership structure to be found in violation of
any existing and/or future PRC laws or regulations and could limit the Company s ability, through the Primary Beneficiary,
to enforce its rights under these contractual arrangements. Furthermore, shareholders of the VIE may have interests that are different
with those of the Company, which could potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act in contrary to the terms of the
aforementioned agreements.  

In
addition, if the current structure or any of the contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of any existing or future
PRC law, the Company may be subject to penalties, which may include but not be limited to, the cancellation or revocation of the
Company s business and operating licenses, being required to restructure the Company s operations or discontinue the
Company s operating activities. The imposition of any of these or other penalties may result in a material and adverse effect
on the Company s ability to conduct its operations. In such case, the Company may not be able to operate or control the
VIE, which may result in deconsolidation of the VIE.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and
notes required by the United States of America generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for annual financial
statements are not included herein. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 of Orient Paper, Inc. a Nevada
corporation, and its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (which we sometimes refer to collectively as  Orient Paper ,
 we ,  us  or  our ).  

Principles
of Consolidation   

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature,
unless otherwise noted. The balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.  

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require
us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, based on information available
at the time they are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  

Valuation
of long-lived asset   

The
Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrants such a review.
The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is
separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset and intangible assets. Fair market value is determined
primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets
and intangible assets to be disposed are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost
to dispose.

PAPER, INC.   

   NOTES

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company has adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require any new fair value
measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source
of the information. It establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy of valuation techniques based on observable and unobservable
inputs, which may be used to measure fair value and include the following:  

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.  

Classification
within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and valuation methods. Considerable
judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts that
the Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of
the Company s short term financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts and notes
payable, short-term bank loans and balance due to a related party, approximate at their fair values because of the short maturity
of these instruments, were classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy; while loans from Credit union, loans from a related
party and obligation under capital lease approximate at their fair value as the interest rates thereon are close to the market
rates of interest published by the People s Bank of China, which were also classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The
carrying amount of the stock warrants is recorded at fair value and is determined using the Binominal pricing model based on the
Company's stock price at the measurement date, exercise price of the warrant, risk-free rate and historical volatility. The Company
classified these instruments as a Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note (13) below.  

Non-Recurring
Fair Value Measurements   

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the
possibility of impairment. For the continuing operations, long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when there is an indicator of impairment, and they are recorded at fair value only when impairment is recognized. For discontinued
operations, long-lived assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value of
these assets were determined using models with significant unobservable inputs which were classified as Level 3 inputs, primarily
the discounted future cash flow.  

Share-Based
Compensation   

The
Company uses the fair value recognition provision of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires the Company
to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair
value of such instruments over the vesting period.  

The
Company also applies the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees to account for stock-based compensation
awards issued to non-employees for services. Such awards for services are recorded at either the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more reliably measurable.  

Liquidity
and Going Concern   

As
of September 30, 2016 the Company had current assets of $18,353,799 and current liabilities of $30,389,462 (including amounts
due to related parties of $833,693), resulting in a working capital deficit of approximately $12,035,663; while as of December
31, 2015, the Company had current assets of $26,343,993 and current liabilities of $40,237,947 (including amounts due to related
parties of $920,866), resulting in a working capital deficit of approximately $13,893,954. We are currently seeking to restructure
the term of our liabilities by raising funds through long-term loans to pay off liabilities with shorter terms. Our ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing or negotiating the terms of the existing short-term
liabilities to meet our current and future liquidity needs.

a result of the sale and leaseback of equipment on June 16, 2013, a deferred gain in the amount of $1,379,282 was recorded. The
deferred gain is being amortized over the lease term and as an offset to depreciation of the Leased Equipment. In term of the
extension of the new payment schedule, the deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining lease term up to June 21, 2017.   

As

The
Company has adopted ASC Topic 740-10-05,  Income Taxes.  To date, the adoption of this interpretation has not impacted
the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company performed self-assessment and the Company s
liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years
still subject to review by taxing authorities. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed,
which in the PRC is usually 5 years. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit
period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material
to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management considered that the Company had no uncertain
tax positions affecting its condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations or cash flows, and will continue
to evaluate for any uncertain position in future. There are no estimated interest costs and penalties provided in the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company s tax positions related to open tax years are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities and the

lease with a 30-year term, which expires on December 31, 2031. The lease requires an annual rental payment of approximately
$17,970 (RMB 120,000). This operating lease is renewable at the end of the 30-year term.  

On
November 27, 2012, Orient Paper entered into a 49.4 acres land lease with an investment company in the Economic Development Zone
in Wei County, Hebei Province, China. The lease term of the Wei County land lease commences on the date of the lease and lasts

tissue paper production lines and future production facilities in the leased Wei County land.  

As
mentioned in Note (9) Related Party Transactions, in connection with the sale of Industrial Buildings to Hebei Fangsheng, Hebei
Fangsheng agrees to lease the Industrial Buildings back to Orient Paper at an annual rental of $149,750 (RMB 1,000,000), for a

Capital
commitment   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has signed several contracts for construction of equipment and facilities, including a new
tissue paper production line PM8. Total outstanding commitments under these contracts were $14,869,589 and $17,429,301 as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company expected to pay off all the balances within 1 year.  

Guarantees
and Indemnities   

The
Company was a party to enter into contracts to indemnify a third party for certain liabilities, and as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company guaranteed the third party s long-term loan from the financial institutions amounting to
$8,385,995 (RMB56,000,000) and $8,623,876 (RMB56,000,000) that matured at various times in 2018, as a guarantor. In most cases,
the Company cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would result
in a liability under the indemnities. The Company believes that the liabilities for potential future payments of these guarantees
and indemnities are not probable.

Segment Reporting   

Since
March 10, 2010, Orient Paper Shengde started its operations and thereafter the Company manages its operations through two business
operating segments: Orient Paper HB, which produces offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper, and Orient Paper Shengde,
which produces digital photo paper. They are managed separately because each business requires different technology and marketing
strategies.   

The
Company evaluates performance of its operating segments based on net income. Administrative functions such as finance,
treasury, and information systems are centralized. However, where applicable, portions of the administrative function
expenses are allocated between the operating segments based on gross revenue generated. The operating segments do share
facilities in Xushui County, Baoding City, Hebei Province, China. All sales were sold to customers located in the
PRC.   

Summarized
financial information for the two reportable segments is as follows:

Concentration and Major Customers and Suppliers   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no single customer contributed over 10% of total sales. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no single customer contributing over 10% of total sales.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had three major suppliers accounted for 63%, 14% and 8% of total purchases. For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had two major suppliers which primarily accounted for 60% and 20% of the
total purchases.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had three major suppliers which primarily accounted for 63%, 10% and 7%
of the total purchases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had two major suppliers which primarily accounted
for 61% and 19% of the total purchases.  

(20)
Concentration of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments for which the Company is potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company
places its cash in reputable financial institutions in the PRC and the United States. Although it is generally understood that
the PRC central government stands behind all of the banks in China in the event of bank failure, there is no deposit insurance
system in China that is similar to the protection provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) of
the United States as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. On May 1, 2015, the new  Deposit Insurance Regulations 
was effective in the PRC that the maximum protection would be up to RMB500,000 (US$74,875) per depositor per insured financial
intuition, including both principal and interest. For the cash placed in financial institutions in the United States, the Company s
U.S. bank accounts are all fully covered by the FDIC insurance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, while
for the cash placed in financial institutions in the PRC, the balances exceeding the maximum coverage of RMB500,000 amounted to
RMB35,930,833 (US$5,380,639) as of September 30, 2016.  

(21)
Risks and Uncertainties   

Orient
Paper is subject to substantial risks from, among other things, intense competition associated with the industry in general, other
risks associated with financing, liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, foreign currency exchange rates,
and operating in the PRC under its various laws and restrictions.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The Board is issuing
this Update as part of its Simplification Initiative. The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate,
and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining
or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas for simplification in this
Update were identified through outreach for the Simplification Initiative, pre-agenda research for the Private Company Council,
and the August 2014 Post-Implementation Review Report on FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. The areas for simplification
in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas
for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities,
the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts
the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The adoption of
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment
or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates
that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after
a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life
insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial
interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $37,462,066, an increase of $5,055,189, or 15.6%, from $32,406,877 for the same
period in the previous year.  

Revenue
of Offset Printing Paper, Corrugating Medium Paper and Tissue Paper Products    

Revenue
from sales of offset printing paper, corrugating medium paper ( CMP ) and tissue paper products for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $37,397,395, an increase of $5,141,877, or 15.94%, from $32,255,518 for the third quarter of 2015.
The increase was primarily due to the increase in sales of regular CMP and tissue paper products, sales of which began in June
2015.  

Total
offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to 96,933
tonnes, an increase of 20,161 tonnes, or 26.26%, compared to 76,772 tonnes sold in the comparable period in the previous year.
This was mainly due to the increase in quantity sold of regular CMP and tissue paper products. The changes in revenue dollar amount
and in quantity sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:  

Monthly
sales revenue (excluding revenue from digital photo paper and tissue paper products) for the 24 months ended September 30, 2016,

The
Average Selling Prices (ASPs) for our main products in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 are summarized as follows:  

The
following chart shows the month-by-month ASPs (excluding the ASPs of the digital photo paper and tissue paper products) for the
24 month period ended September 30, 2016:  

Corrugating Medium Paper   

Revenue
from CMP amounted to $26,429,906 (70.67% of the total offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products revenues) for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, representing an increase of $3,762,474, or 16.60%, from $22,667,432 for the comparable period
in 2015.  

We
sold 81,035 tonnes of CMP in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 62,875 tonnes for the same period in 2015,
representing a 28.88% increase in quantity sold.  

ASP
for regular CMP dropped from $359/tonne for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $325/tonne for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, representing a 9.47% decrease. ASP in RMB for regular CMP for the third quarter of 2015 and 2016 were RMB2,264
and RMB2,165, respectively, representing a 4.37% decrease. The quantity of regular CMP sold increased by 15,685 tonnes, from 52,737
tonnes in the third quarter of 2015 to 68,422 tonnes in the third quarter of 2016.  

ASP
for light-weight CMP dropped from $366/tonne for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $332/tonne for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, representing a $9.29% decrease. ASP in RMB for light-weight CMP for the third quarter of 2015 and 2016
were RMB2,308 and RMB2,208, respectively, representing a 4.33% decrease. The quantity of light-weight CMP sold slightly increased
by 2,475 tonnes, from 10,138 tonnes in the third quarter of 2015, to 12,613 tonnes in the third quarter of 2016.  

We
believe that the decreases in ASPs in USD for CMP were a result of the slowdown of China s economic growth, an over-supply
in the Chinese paper industry and the depreciation of the RMB against the USD in 2016. We consider these decreases a sign of the
downward pricing pressure on the Chinese paper industry. We believe that the government continuing to require that outdated paper
manufacturing facilities close will partially offset the downward pricing pressure.  

Our
PM6 production line, which produces regular CMP, has a designated capacity of 360,000 tonnes /year. The utilization rates for
the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 were 74.59% and 59.21%, respectively, representing an increase of 15.38%.  

Quantities
sold for regular CMP that was produced by the PM6 production line from October 2014 to September 2016 are as follows:  

Offset Printing
Paper   

Revenue
from offset printing paper was $9,338,690 (24.97% of the total offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products revenues)
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a slight increase of $26,023, or 0.28%, from $9,312,667 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.We sold 14,571 tonnes of offset printing paper in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 13,689
tonnes in the comparable period of 2015, an increase of 882 tonnes, or 6.44%. ASPs for offset printing paper for the third quarter
of 2015 and 2016 were $680 and $641, respectively, representing a 5.74% decrease. Both ASP in RMB for offset printing paper for
the third quarter of 2015 and 2016 were RMB4,274. Therefore, the decrease in ASP in USD was the result of the depreciation of
RMB against USD in 2016. We estimate that the regional market of offset printing paper will continue to be relatively stable and
the ASP for offset printing paper will not likely experience a significant change in 2016.  

Tissue Paper Products   

We
began the commercial production of tissue paper products in Wei County Industry Park in June 2015. We process base tissue paper
purchased from a third party and produce finished tissue paper products, including toilet paper, boxed and soft-packed tissues,
handkerchief tissues and paper napkins, as well as bathroom and kitchen paper towels. We market and sell the finished tissue paper
products under the Orient Paper brand. We sold 1,327 tonnes of tissue paper products and received $1,628,799 in revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. We expect a stable increase in production of the tissue paper products in the near future.  

Revenue of
Digital Photo Paper   

Revenue generated
from selling digital photo paper were $64,671 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Only 38 tonnes of digital photo paper
was sold from inventory in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. In October 2014, we shut down and disassembled our digital
photo paper production facilities (the PM4 and PM5 production lines) for relocation mandated by the local County government, and
in August 2015 we completed the relocation and resumed commercial production of digital photo paper. In June 2016, we suspended
the production of digital photo paper due to low market demand for our products. We expect that our digital photo paper production
will remain suspended for the near future. We intend to resume the production of digital photo paper if and when the market shows
a greater demand for our products. 

Changes
in revenue and quantities sold of our digital photo paper for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized
as follows:  

Digital
photo paper s monthly ASPs, monthly sales quantity (in tonnes) and monthly sales revenue for the 24 months from October
2014 to September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:  

Cost of Sales  

Total
cost of sales for CMP, offset printing paper and tissue paper products for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $30,049,487,
an increase of $4,351,593, or 16.93%, from $25,697,894 for the comparable period in 2015. This was mainly a result of (i) an increase
in cost of sales of $1,155,936 for tissue paper products, the commercial production of which was launched in June 2015, and (ii)
a increase in cost of sales of $3,609,473 for regular CMP.  

Cost of
sales for CMP was $21,854,757 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $17,655,425 for the comparable period in
2015. The increase in the cost of sales of $4,199,332 for CMP was in line with the increase in quantities of CMP produced and
sold in the third quarter of 2016. Average cost of sales per tonne for CMP decreased by 3.91%, from $281 in the third quarter
of 2015 to $270 in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in average cost of sales was mainly attributable to the depreciation
of RMB against USD in 2016, which was offset by the higher average unit purchase costs (net of applicable value added tax) of
recycled paper board in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Cost of sales for offset printing paper
was $6,768,202 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7,771,877 for the comparable period in 2015. Average
cost of sales per tonne of offset printing paper decreased by 18.31%, from $568 in the three months ended September 30, 2015,
to $464 during the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in average cost of sales of offset printing paper was mainly due to
lower average unit purchase costs (net of applicable value added tax) of recycled white scrap paper in the third quarter of 2016,
and introduction of recycled scrap binding margin, a new raw material, which costs less (net of applicable value added tax) than
recycled white scrap paper, into the offset printing paper production. This new material was introduced in certain types of offset
printing paper production in July 2016 to reduce the brightness of the paper to meet the special requirements of certain customers.
Cost of sales for tissue paper products was $1,426,528 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Average cost of sales per tonne
of tissue paper products was $1,075 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Changes in cost of
sales and cost per tonne by product for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:  

Our average unit purchase costs
(net of applicable value added tax) of recycled paper board and recycled white scrap paper in the three months ended September
30, 2016 were RMB 1,084/tonne (approximately $165/tonne) and RMB 2,222/tonne (approximately $338/tonne), respectively, as compared
to RMB 974/tonne (approximately $157/tonne) and RMB 2,564/tonne (approximately $414/tonne) for the three months ended September
30, 2015, respectively. These changes (in US dollars) represent a year-over-year increase of 5.10% for the recycled paper board
and a year-over-year decrease of 18.36% for the recycled white scrap paper. Our production exclusively uses domestic recycled paper
(sourced mainly from the Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan area). Although we do not rely on imported recycled paper, the pricing of
which tends to be more volatile than domestic recycled paper, our experience suggests that the pricing of domestic recycled paper
bears some correlation to the pricing of imported recycled paper. After the Chinese government repealed its  Operation Green
Fence  policy (a strict inspection policy) in January 2015, many paper mills that had stopped using imported recycled paper
started doing so again. This resulted in a decline in the price of domestic recycled paper in the third quarter of 2016. The price
of recycled white scrap paper also decreased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. The average unit
purchase costs (net of applicable value added tax) of recycled scrap binding margin was RMB 1,551/tonne (approximately $236/tonne)
in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The
pricing trends of our major raw materials for the 24-month period from July 2014 to June 2016 are shown below:  

Electricity
and coal are our two main energy sources. The price of coal has been subject to seasonal fluctuations in China, with the
peaks often occurring in the winter months.  In 2015, electricity and coal accounted for approximately 8% and 4% of
total sales, respectively.  The average cost per tonne of coal went up from $62.67 (RMB391) in the third quarter of
2015 to $68.2 (RMB449) in third quarter of 2016, accounting for approximately 4% of total sales in the third quarter of 2016.
The monthly energy cost (electricity and coal) as a percentage of total monthly sales of our main paper products for the 24 months
ended September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:  

Gross Profit   

Gross profit for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,330,843 (19.57% of the total revenue), representing an increase of $914,282, or
14.25%, from the gross profit of $6,416,561 (19.80% of the total revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was mainly due to the increase in gross profit of offset printing paper as a result of the decreased cost of recycled white scrap
paper and the introduction of a new raw material in the production of certain types of offset printing paper in the third quarter
of 2016, as further described above. 

Offset Printing
Paper, CMP and Tissue Paper Products   

Gross
profit for offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,347,908,
an increase of $790,284, or 12.05%, from the gross profit of $6,557,624 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was mainly the result of the factors discussed above.  

The
overall gross profit margin for offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products decreased by 0.68 percentage point, from
20.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to 19.65% for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for regular CMP for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 15.99%, or 4.44 percentage point lower, as compared
to gross profit margin of 20.43% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was primarily the result of the
decline in the ASP of regular CMP in the third quarter of 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for light-weight CMP for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 24.32%, or 6.35 percentage points lower,
as compared to gross profit margin of 30.67% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was primarily the result
of the decline in light-weight CMP ASP in the third quarter of 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for offset printing paper was 27.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 10.98 percentage
points, as compared to 16.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Gross profit
margin for tissue paper products for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 12.42%.  

Monthly
gross profit margins on the sales of our CMP and offset printing paper for the 24-month period ended September 30, 2016 are as
follows:  

Digital Photo
Paper   

Loss
for digital photo paper for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $17,065, representing a gross margin of -26.39%. As discussed above, we started the relocation of our PM4 and PM5 production lines in October 2014,
and completed the relocation and resumed commercial production of our digital photo paper in August 2015. The sales in the third
quarter of 2016 were not sufficient to cover the depreciation cost charged to this period. In June 2016, we suspended the production
of digital photo paper due to low market demand for our products. We expect that our digital photo paper production will remain
suspended for the rest of 2016. We intend to resume the production of digital photo paper if and when the market shows a greater
demand for our products.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,599,698, a decrease of $1,215,084, or
31.85% from $3,814,782 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was attributable to the additional depreciation
charge for idle property, plant and equipment at the tissue paper plant in Wei Country that took place in the third quarter of
2015.  

Income
from Operations    

Operating
income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $4,731,145, an increase of $2,129,366, or 81.84%, from operating income of
$2,601,779 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gross
profit and the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above.  

Other Income
and Expenses   

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $111,454, from $566,122 in the three months September 30, 2015,
to $677,576. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to the increase in borrowing rates. The Company had short-term and
long-term interest-bearing loans, related party loans and leasing obligations that aggregated $35,711,062 as of September 30,
2016, as compared to $40,905,866 as of September 30, 2015. The interest incurred during the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, were $10,839 and $19,294, respectively, and were capitalized as soft-cost of construction-in-progress. The interest
expense capitalized in both periods was solely related to the sale-leaseback obligation with China National Foreign Trade Financial
  Leasing Co., Ltd ( CNFTFL ).  

Net Income   

As
a result of the above, net income was $3,034,542 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, representing an increase of $1,348,645,
or 80.00%, from net income of $1,685,897 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $103,368,291, an increase of $3,173,928, or 3.17%, from $100,194,363 for the
same period in the previous year.  

Revenue of
Offset Printing Paper, Corrugating Medium Paper and Tissue Paper Products    

Revenue
from sales of offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $102,703,977,
an increase of $2,686,754, or 2.69%, from $100,017,223 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was mainly due to the
increase in sales of tissue paper products beginning in June 2015, which was partially offset by the decrease in sales of regular
CMP in the nine months of 2016.  

Total
quantities of offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted
to 262,750 tonnes, an increase of 26,415 tonnes, or 11.18%, compared to 236,335 tonnes sold during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Total quantities of CMP and offset printing paper sold increased by 22,835 tonnes in the nine months of 2016 as compared
to the same period of 2015. We sold 3,788 tonnes of tissue paper products in the nine months of 2016 as opposed to 208 tonnes
in the same period of 2015. The changes in revenue and in quantities sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
are summarized as follows:  

A
summary of the above changes and further analyses of the changes in our sales revenue are as follows:

Revenue of
Digital Photo Paper   

Revenue generated
from selling digital photo paper were $664,314 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Only 44 tonnes of digital photo paper
was sold from inventory in the same period of 2015. In October 2014, we shut down and disassembled our digital photo paper production
facilities (the PM4 and PM5 production lines) for relocation mandated by the local County government, and in August 2015 we completed
the relocation and resumed commercial production of digital photo paper. In June 2016, we suspended the production of digital photo
paper due to low market demand for our products. We expect that our digital photo paper production will remain suspended for the
rest of 2016. 

Changes
in revenue and quantities sold of our digital photo paper for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized
as follows:  

Cost of Sales   

Total cost of sales
for CMP, offset printing paper and tissue paper products in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $84,327,253, an increase
of $6,333,767, or 8.12%, from $77,993,486 for the comparable period in 2015. This was mainly a result of (i) an increase in cost
of sales of $3,878,282 for tissue paper products, the commercial production of which was launched in June 2015 and (ii) an increase
in cost of sales of $2,381,058 for regular CMP. Cost of sales for CMP was $59,227,017 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $56,293,394 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in the cost of sales of $2,933,623 for CMP was in line
with the increase in the quantities of CMP produced and sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Average cost of sales
per tonne for CMP decreased by 4.56%, from $285 for the nine months of 2015, to $272 in the same period of 2016.The decrease was
mainly attributable to the depreciation of RMB against USD in 2016, which was partially offset by the higher average unit purchase
costs (net of applicable value added tax) of recycled paper board in the nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.
Cost of sales for offset printing paper was $20,951,362 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $21,429,500
for the comparable period in 2015. Average cost of sales per tonne of offset printing paper decreased by 8.99%, from $556 in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $506 during the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in average cost of sales of offset
printing paper was mainly due to lower average unit purchase costs (net of applicable value added tax) of recycled white scrap
paper, and introduction of recycled scrap binding margin, a new raw material, which costs less (net of applicable value added tax)
than recycled white scrap paper, into the offset printing paper production in third quarter of 2016. Cost of sales for tissue paper
products was $4,148,874 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Average cost of sales per tonne of tissue paper products
was $1,095 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Changes
in cost of sales and cost per tonne by product for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cost of sales for digital photo paper was $314,069, as compared to $1,054,556 for the
same period in year 2016.  

Gross Profit   

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $17,986,481 (17.40% of the total revenue), representing a decrease of
$3,900,327, or 17.82%, from the gross profit of $21,886,808 (21.84% of the total revenue) for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the decreases in ASPs for CMP and offset printing paper in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the comparable period in 2015.  

Offset Printing
Paper, CMP and Tissue Paper Products   

Gross
profit for offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18,376,724,
a decrease of $3,647,013, or 16.56%, from the gross profit of $22,023,737 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
was mainly the result of the factors discussed above.  

The
overall gross profit margin for offset printing paper, CMP and tissue paper products decreased by 4.13 percentage points, from
22.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to 17.89% for nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for regular CMP for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 15.27%, or 6.18 percentage points lower, as compared
to gross profit margin of 21.45% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was primarily the result of the decline
in the ASP of regular CMP in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for light-weight CMP for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 23.92%, or 7.46 percentage point lower, as
compared to gross profit margin of 31.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Such decrease was primarily the result
of the decline in light-weight CMP ASP in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
profit margin for offset printing paper was 22.17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 2.81 percentage
point, as compared to 19.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Gross
profit margin for tissue paper products for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 12.02%.  

Digital
Photo Paper    

Loss
for digital photo paper for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $390,243, representing a gross margin of -58.74%. As
discussed above, we started the relocation of our PM4 and PM5 production lines in October 2014, and completed the relocation and
resumed commercial production of our digital photo paper in August 2015. The sales in the nine months of 2016 were not sufficient
to cover the depreciation cost charged to this period. In June 2016, we suspended the production of digital photo paper due to
low market demand for our products. We expect that our digital photo paper production will remain suspended for the rest of 2016.
We intend to resume the production of digital photo paper if and when the market shows a greater demand for our products.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $9,667,182, an increase of $2,312,038, or
31.43%, from $7,355,144 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to (i) the increase in the depreciation
expenses for our temporarily idle property, plant and equipment at the new tissue paper plant in our Wei County Industrial Park
and (ii) 1,133,916 shares of common stock granted under our compensatory incentive plans in the nine months ended September 30,
2016, valued at $1,417,395.  

Income from
Operations   

Operating
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $8,319,299, a decrease of $6,212,365, or 42.75%, from $14,531,664 for
the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was primarily caused by the decrease in gross profit for regular CMP and light-weight
CMP and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above.  

Other Income
and Expenses   

Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $255,785, from $2,350,233 in the nine months ended September
30, 2015, to $2,094,448 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had short-term and long-term interest-bearing
loans, related party loans and leasing obligations that aggregated $35,711,062 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $40,905,866
as of September 30, 2015. The interest incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $43,786 and $116,494
(a portion of interest related to the sale-leaseback arrangement with CNFTFL), respectively, and were capitalized as soft-cost
of construction-in-progress.  

Net Income
(Loss)   

As
a result of the above, net income was $4,242,251 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $5,139,665,
or 54.78%, from net income of $9,381,916 for the comparable period in 2015.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Net
accounts receivable increased by $953,770, or 50.08%, to $2,858,166 as of September 30, 2016, as compared with $1,904,396 as of
December 31, 2015. We usually collect accounts receivable within 30 days of delivery and completion of sales.  

Inventories   

Inventories consist
of raw materials (accounting for 82.53% of total value of ending inventory as of September 30, 2016) and finished goods. As of
September 30, 2016, the recorded value of inventory decreased by 18.63%, to $7,490,524 from $9,205,420 as of December 31, 2015.
As of September 30, 2016, the ending inventory of recycled paper board, which is the main raw material for the production of CMP,
was $4,625,830, approximately $209,578, or 4.75%, higher than the balance as of December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily
due to the increase in our CMP production. The ending inventory of recycled white scrap paper was $551,290, approximately $1,329,033,
or 70.68%, lower than the balance as of December 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the lower purchase cost of recycled white
scrap paper and the introduction of recycled scrap binding margin, a new raw material used as a substitute for recycled white scrap
paper for certain types of offset printing paper production, in the third quarter of 2016. The ending inventory of tissue base
paper was $16,278, approximately $64,791, or 79.92%, lower than the balance as of December 31, 2015. This is mainly because we
increased our stock of tissue base paper in December 2015 in anticipation of increasing production in 2016. The ending inventory
of finished goods was $1,308,498, approximately $850,410, or 39.39%, lower than the balance as of December 31, 2015. There was
temporary production suspension from December 14, 2015 to December 29, 2015, which led to higher than typical inventory quantities
of finished goods, including CMP and offset printing paper, at December 31, 2015. 

A
summary of changes in major inventory items is as follows:  

Accounts Payable and Notes Payable   

Accounts
payable and notes payable was $3,542,331 as of September 30, 2016, a decrease of 10,570,894, or 74.90%, from $14,113,225 as of
December 31, 2015. Accounts payable was $1,296,082 and $253,425, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
We have been relying on the bank acceptance notes issued under our credit facilities with Bank of Hebei and Commercial Bank of
the City of Zhangjiakou (the  CBCZ Bank ) to make the majority of our raw materials payments to our vendors. Our notes
payable amounted to $2,246,249 and $13,859,800 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We have paid off
bank acceptance notes of $5,989,997 in January 2016, $7,487,496 in April 2016, $958,399 in August 2016. We also acquired additional
bank acceptance notes of $2,246,249 from Bank of Hebei in August 2016, which we expect to pay off upon maturity on February 1,
2017.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Overview   

As
of September 30,2016, we had a net working capital deficit of $12,035,663, a decrease of $1,858,291, from the net working capital
deficit of $13,893,954 at December 31,2015. Total current assets as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $18,353,799. Substantially
all cash and cash equivalents are cash deposits in bank accounts. Restricted cash of $2,246,249 was included in our current assets
as of September 30, 2016. Restricted cash is deposited at the Bank of Hebei for purpose of securing the bank acceptance notes
from the bank. The acceptance notes are due and payable on February 1, 2017, and the Company anticipates renewing such notes upon
the maturity on substantially similar terms.  

Our
current liabilities decreased after we paid off the bank acceptance notes issued by the Bank of Hebei in August 2016. Current
liabilities as of September 30, 2016 totaled $30,389,462, a decrease of $9,848,485, from the December 31, 2015 balance of $40,237,947.
Our current liabilities included the current portion of the capital lease payable in the amount of $9,265,227. We use bank acceptance
notes, which are typically 6-to-12 month notes, to guarantee the payments to our vendors. Notes payable was $2,246,249 as of September
30, 2016, representing a decrease of $11,613,551, or 83.79%, from $13,859,800 as of December 31, 2015. Most of our current short-term
bank loans are either revolving or term loans. We expect to renew these loans with the banks on similar terms at or before maturity.
All of our short-term loans (with the exception of the notes payable, which carry no interest but require a deposit equal to a
portion of the credit facilities at the issuing banks) have interest-only monthly payments, with a balloon payment for the entire
principal amount upon maturity of the loan. The long term loans from the credit union require quarterly interest payments, with
one large balloon payment upon maturity. We entered into a three-year sale-leaseback financing agreement with CNFTFL on June 16,
2013, which provides for a three-year full amortization schedule with periodic principal payments every six months. Essentially
all proceeds of the sale-leaseback were used to finance the construction of the Wei County tissue paper expansion project. In
July 2015, we entered into a new agreement with CNFTFL, which amended and restated the 2013 CNFTFL lease financing agreement.
Pursuant to the 2015 CNFTFL lease financing agreement, we are required to make interest payments every quarter and principal payments
every six months until June 21, 2017. These payments range from approximately $0.1 million to approximately $3.5 million (see
 Financing with Sale-Leaseback  below for more details.).  

Efforts to
Mitigate the Net Working Capital Deficit   

Amount
due to a related party included in current liabilities was $21,642 as of September 30, 2016, which is the rent payable due to
a related party (see  Relocation of Facilities and Sale of Headquarters Compound Real Properties  below), and accrued
interest payable of $812,051,which was included in other payables and accrued liabilities. Excluding the related party payables,
the net working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016 was $11,201,970.  

On
November 1, 2016, Mr. Zhenyong Liu agreed to permit the Company to continue to postpone the repayment of the accrued interest
on his loans to the Company and Orient Paper HB (as described under Note 9 to the Company s financial statements included
in this report) until the Company is able to pay its other creditors in its normal course of business. The accrued interest owned
to Mr. Zhenyong Liu was approximately $812,051, which was recorded in other payables and accrued liabilities as part of the current
liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  

On
March 1, 2015, the Company entered an agreement with Mr. Zhenyong Liu, which allows Orient Paper HB to borrow from the CEO with
an amount up to $17,969,990 (RMB120,000,000) for working capital purposes. The advances or funding under the agreement are due
in three years from the date each amount is funded. The loan is unsecured and carries an annual interest rate set on the basis
of the primary lending rate of the People s Bank of China at the time of the borrowing. As of September 30, 2016, $4,492,498
was drawn from the facility.   

Our
loan-to-equity ratio was 20.24% as of September 30, 2016. Our debt-asset ratio was 19.62% as of September 30, 2016. The industry
average of debt-asset ratios in China for 2015 was 42%, according to the latest industry report in 2016 provided by China Industry
Intelligence Center at  wenku.baidu.com  . As long as we are able to manage our short-term liquidity, we believe that our
overall financial condition, compared to our Chinese peers, is reasonably healthy and should allow us to further leverage our
assets to obtain capital for future growth.  

From
time to time, we investigate financing opportunities with banks and other financial institutions and investors both inside and
outside of China, and we may seek long-term financings to pay off liabilities with shorter terms. We cannot guarantee that our
efforts will be successful. As of the date of this report, we have not entered into any material binding agreement for additional
long-term financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing either from banks or through debt
or equity investments from investors. If we are unable to obtain sufficient outside financing, whether short-term or long-term,
or generate sufficient operating cash flow internally, the progress of our construction or renovation projects may slow down or
may otherwise be negatively affected. We may also have to curtail the scope of our capital expenditure projects or shelve some
components of such projects, such as, delaying the installation of PM9 until additional capital resources are available.  

Financing
with Sale-Leaseback   

The
Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement (the  Lease Financing Agreement ) with CNFTFL on June 16, 2013,
for a total financing proceeds in the amount of RMB 150 million (approximately US$22 million). Pursuant to the Lease Financing
Agreement, Orient Paper HB sold some equipment to CNFTFL for RMB 150 million (approximately US$22 million). Concurrent with the
sale of equipment, Orient Paper HB leases back all of the equipment sold to CNFTFL for a lease term of three years. At the end
of the lease term, Orient Paper HB may pay a nominal purchase price of RMB 15,000 (approximately $2,246) to CNFTFL to buy back
all of the Leased Equipment. The sale-leaseback is treated by the Company as a mere financing and capital lease transaction, rather
than a sale of assets (under which gain or loss is immediately recognized) under ASC 840-40-25-4. All of the leased equipment
is included as part of the property, plant and equipment of the Company for the periods presented; the net present value of the
minimum lease payments (including a lease service charge equal to 5.55% of the amount financed, i.e. approximately US$1.36 million)
was recorded as obligations under capital lease and these payments incur interest at CNFTFL s implicit interest rate of
6.15% per annum. At the inception of the lease on June 16, 2013, the net present value of the minimum lease payments were stated
at $25,750,170.  

Orient
Paper HB made all payments due according to the Lease Financing Agreement prior to December 15, 2014. On December 15, 2014, Orient
Paper HB stopped making principal payments and entered into negotiations with CNFTFL regarding a modified payment schedule for
the remaining obligations. During the course of negotiations, Orient Paper HB continued to make interest payments due (as well
as a payment of a liquidated damage of approximately $9,200 on December 26, 2014). No remedial measures were taken by CNFTFL or
its parent company. On May 19, 2015 and June 15, 2015, the Company made payments to CNFTF of RMB 5,000,000 (approximately $0.8
million) and RMB 20,000,000 (approximately $3 million), respectively. On July 1, 2015, Orient Paper HB, Shijiazhuang Office of
China Orient Asset Management Corporation ( China Orient ), the parent and assignee of the rights of CNFTFL, and some
guarantors of Lease Financing Agreement, entered into an agreement (the  2015 Agreement ) to amend and restate the
Lease Financing Agreement. The 2015 Agreement sets forth a modified and extended payment schedule with respect to the remaining
payment obligation, with the final repayment date extended to June 21, 2017. Under the 2015 Agreement, the interest accrues at
a rate of 15% per annum starting on June 16, 2015, and is payable on the 20th of every March, June, September and December until
the principal is paid off, except for the first payment, which was due on July 31, 2015. Orient Paper HB made all payments due
according to the modified schedule prior to June 20, 2016. On June 21, 2016, Orient Paper HB only made a partial payment of RMB
2,300,000 (US$ 349,385) out of the amount of RMB 22,300,000 (US$3,387,513) due on June 20, 2016. China Orient has not accordingly
taken any remedial measures under the 2015 Agreement. The Company made interest payment due according to the modified schedule,
as well as a payment of interest $141,695 on the overdue amount RMB 20,000,000 (US$3,038,128), at a rate of 18.25% per annum on
September 20, 2016 in accordance with the 2015 Agreement. The Company is currently in negotiation with the CNFTFL regarding a
potential modification on the payment schedule for the remaining obligations. During the course of negotiations, Orient Paper
HB continues to accrue interest at a rate of 18.25% per annum for the overdue portion and 15% per annum for the remaining portion
in accordance with the 2015 Agreement.  

In
accordance with ASC 840-30-35, the present balances of the capital lease assets and obligations under capital lease were adjusted
by an amount equal to the difference between the present value of the future minimum lease payments under the revised agreement
(computed using the interest rate used to recognize the lease initially) and the present balance of the obligation, which is approximately
$1,617,574 at the date of the 2015 Agreement. The balance of the long-term obligations under capital lease was $nil as of September
30, 2016 and $3,217,785 as of December 31, 2015, net of its current portion in the amount of $9,265,227 and $6,860,412, respectively.
Included in the current portion, balance of $RMB 20,000,000 (approximately US$2,994,998) was overdue as of September 30, 2016.
We are currently negotiating with the CNFTEL regarding the potential modification on the payment schedule.  

Total
interest expense for the sale-leaseback arrangement for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $237,053 and
$169,742. Total interest expenses for the sale-leaseback arrangement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were
$$526,912 and $1,024,866, respectively.  

As
a result of the sale and leaseback of equipment on June 16, 2013, a deferred gain in the amount of $1,379,282 was recorded. The
deferred gain is being amortized over the lease term and as an offset to depreciation of the leased equipment. With respect to
the new payment schedule, the deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining lease term through June 21, 2017.  

As
part of the sale-leaseback transaction, Orient Paper HB entered into a Collateral Agreement with CNFTFL and pledged the land use
right, valued at approximately $6,476,591, on some 58,566 square meters of land as collateral for the lease. In addition to Orient
Paper HB s collateral, Orient Paper Shengde also entered into a Guarantee Contract with CNFTFL on June 16, 2013. Under the
Guarantee Contract, Orient Paper Shengde agrees to guarantee Orient Paper HB s performance under the lease and pledged all
of its production equipment as additional collateral. The net book value of Orient Paper Shengde s asset guarantee was $25,209,525
and $28,745,628 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Relocation
of Facilities and Sale of Headquarters Compound Real Properties   

A
Xushui County urban redevelopment plan mandates that the current site of our Headquarters Compound and its neighboring area
be reserved for residential use only and that, like other manufacturers in the covered area, we were required to eventually
cease all operations currently conducted on our Headquarters Compound site. On August 7, 2013, the Company s Audit
Committee and the Board of Directors approved the sale of the land use right of the Headquarters Compound (the
 LUR ), the office building and essentially all industrial-use buildings in the Headquarters Compound (the
 Industrial Buildings ), and three employee dormitory buildings located within the Headquarters Compound (the
 Dormitories ) to Hebei Fangsheng for cash prices of approximately $2.77 million, $1.15 million, and $4.31
million respectively. In connection with the sale of the Industrial Buildings, Hebei Fangsheng agreed to lease the Industrial
Buildings back to the Company for its original use for a term of up to three years, with an annual rental payment of
approximately $149,750 (RMB1,000,000). The lease agreement expired in August 2016. On August 9, 2016, the Company paid off
the rental for the first lease agreement and entered into a supplementary agreement with Hebei Fangsheng, who agreed to
extend the lease term for another two years, with the same rental payment as original lease agreement. The accrued rental
owned to Hebei Fangsheng was approximately $21,642 and $368,751, which was recorded as part of the current liabilities as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As a condition for the sale of the Dormitories, Hebei Fangsheng
agreed that it would act as an agent for the Company, which is not qualified to sell residential housing units in China, and
that it is obligated to sell all of the 132 apartment units in the Dormitories to qualified employees of the Company at its
acquisition price. Hebei Fangsheng further agreed that it would not seek to profit from the resale of the Dormitories
units and would allow the Company to inspect the books and records of the sale upon completion of the resale of the
Dormitories units to ensure the objectives are achieved. Sales of the LUR and the Industrial Buildings were completed in
2013.  

Capital Expenditure
Commitment as of September 30, 2016   

We
finance our daily operations mainly by cash flows generated from our business operations and loans from banking institutions (including
leasing companies) and our major shareholders. Major capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily
financed by cash flows generated from financing activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $14.87 million in capital
expenditure commitments that were mainly related to the construction costs of manufacturing equipment and other facilities in
a new industrial park in Wei County of Hebei, China, where we expect to build two tissue paper production lines (PM8 and PM9),
and install other paper production machinery.   

Capital Expenditures  

Our committed capital
expenditures for the next 12 months are approximately $14.87 million, which mainly includes budgeted costs for the projects below: 

New Production Lines at the Wei
County Industrial Park   

In November 2012,
we entered into a 15-year land lease with a land investment company in Wei County for the purpose of developing the 49.4 acres
of land into the base of our next capacity expansion. In December 2012, we signed a contract with an equipment contractor in Shanghai
to build the first of our two tissue paper production lines in Wei County. The two production lines, each having production capacity
of 15,000 tonnes/year, will be designated as PM8 and PM9 upon completion. Total estimated cost of the Wei County tissue paper project
is up to approximately $130 million (of which $113 million has been incurred thus far), including the estimated costs of general
infrastructure and administrative facilities such as warehouses, offices, dorms and landscaping, of up to $102 million (of which
$91 million has been incurred thus far) and the estimated costs for the two paper machines and related packaging equipment of up
to $28 million (of which $22 million has been incurred thus far). We had previously estimated that the installation and test operations
of the PM8 production line would be completed in the second half of 2014. Our current estimated completion time of the PM8 production
line is the fourth quarter of 2017, as we have experienced delays resulting from our inability to obtain approval for a coal burning
boiler installation in the PM8 production line from the Heibei Provincial Government. According to the latest regulation announced
by the Heibei Provincial Government, coal burning boilers are no longer allowed for new plants. We are seeking alternative solutions
and going through necessary procedures for a re-application. The delay of completion of the PM8 production line did not have any
major financial impact on our current period earnings, as we did not previously budget significant revenue or net earnings from
the PM8 production line tissue paper for the third quarter of 2016.  

The projects finished
in 2015 include: three workshops, four warehouses, and packaging machinery, dividing and cutting machinery, as well as infrastructure
and landscaping projects in the Wei County Industrial Park, for a total cost of $76.87 million. We plan to build a second 15,000
tonnes/year tissue paper production line (designated as PM9) at an estimated cost of $7.8 million after the PM8 production line
is put into production. 

Relocation of Digital Photo Paper
PM4 and PM5 Production Lines   

In August 2015,
we completed the relocation of our digital photo paper production lines (PM4 and PM5), as well as related chemical and packaging
equipment, from the workshops located in our Headquarters Compound to a new location that is across the street from our Xushui
Paper Mill, the Xushui Mill Annex. We purchased the land use rights of the 58,566 square meters at Xushui Mill Annex for approximately
$7.7 million in April 2012 and constructed three industrial buildings for the digital photo paper operations, a dormitory for factory
workers and offices to hold our consolidated XushuiCounty operations. We completed the relocation and resumed commercial production
of digital photo paper in August 2015. In June 2016, we suspended the production of digital photo paper due to low market demand
for our products. We expect that our digital photo paper production will remain suspended for the near future. 

Total cost of the
relocation of the PM4 and PM5 production lines and building construction costs incurred was approximately $4.5 million. No further
construction will take place at this facility unless we resume production. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Our cash and cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2016 was $5,591,785, an increase of $2,949,868, from $2,641,917 as of December 31, 2015. The increase
of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to a number of factors: 

i. Net cash
provided by operating activities  

Net cash provided
by operating activities was $8,630,034 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The balance represented a decrease of cash
of $2,038,526, or $19.11%, from $10,668,560 provided for the same period of 2015. The net income of nine months ended September
30, 2016 was from $4,242,251, representing a decrease of $5,139,665, or $54.78%, from a net income of from $9,381,916 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Changes in various asset and liability account balances throughout the nine months ended September
30, 2016 also contributed to the net change in cash from operating activities in the period. Chief among such changes is the increase
of accounts receivable in the amount of $1,041,625 during the period of 2016. There was also a decrease of $1,482,013 in the ending
inventory balance as of September 30, 2016 (an increase to net cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 cash flow purposes).
In addition, the Company had non-cash expenses of (i) depreciation and amortization in the amount of $11,668,976 and (ii) issuances
of shares to officers and directors in the first quarter of 2016 of $1,417,395. The Company also had a net decrease of $1,708,601
in prepayment and other current assets (an increase to net cash) and a net increase of $1,003,210 in other payables and accrued
liabilities and due to a related party (an increase to net cash), as well as an increase in income tax payable of $632,911 (an
increase to net cash) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made.
However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The most critical accounting policies are listed below:  

Revenue Recognition
Policy   

The
Company recognizes revenue when goods are delivered and a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery
is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Goods
are considered delivered when the customer s truck picks up goods at our finished goods inventory warehouse.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

The
Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining useful lives when events or circumstances
lead management to believe that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amount. In such circumstances, those assets are written
down to estimated fair value. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions, assumptions
for operational performance of our businesses, and possible government policy toward operating efficiency of the Chinese paper
manufacturing industry. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no events or circumstances occurred for
which an evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets was required. We are currently not aware of any events or circumstances
that may indicate any need to record such impairment in the future.  

Foreign Currency
Translation   

The
functional currency of Orient Paper HB and Orient Paper Shengde is the Chinese Yuan Renminbi ( RMB ).  Under
ASC Topic 830-30, all assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars using the current exchange rate at the
end of each fiscal period. The current exchange rates used by the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to translate
the Chinese RMB to the U.S. Dollars are 6.6778:1 and 6.4936:1, respectively. Revenues and expenses are translated using the prevailing
average exchange rates at 6.5830:1, and 6.1824:1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Translation
adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss).  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
were the guarantor for a third party for its long-term bank loans in an aggregate amount of $8,385,995 (RMB56,000,000), which
mature at various times in 2018. The third party is one of our major suppliers. The guaranty strengthens our relationship with
the supplier and enables us to negotiate for better terms for payments for our raw materials. Except as aforesaid, we have no
material off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its Simplification Initiative. The objective of the Simplification Initiative
is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can
be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas
for simplification in this Update were identified through outreach for the Simplification Initiative, pre-agenda research for
the Private Company Council, and the August 2014 Post-Implementation Review Report on FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment.
The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of
cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. For public business entities, the amendments
in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.
If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the
fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same
period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Item
    3.   
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.    

Foreign Exchange Risk    

While
our reporting currency is the US dollar, almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated
in RMB. All of our assets are denominated in RMB except for some cash and cash equivalents. As a result, we are exposed to foreign
exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between US dollar
and RMB. When the RMB depreciates against the US dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our
US dollar financial statements will decline. As a result of the RMB s depreciation against US dollar in 2016, $197,154 was
incurred for the exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of 2016. We have not entered into any
hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk.   

Inflation    

Although
we are generally able to pass along minor incremental cost inflation to our customers, inflationary factors such as increases
in the costs of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. We do not believe that inflation in
China has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, however, a high rate of inflation
in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and distribution,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase along
with these increased costs.  

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures.    

As
required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the  Securities Act ), we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which were designed to provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and (2) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes with respect to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting in the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016.
