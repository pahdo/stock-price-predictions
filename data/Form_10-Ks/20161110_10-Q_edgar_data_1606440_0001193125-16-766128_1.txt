   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. (the  Company,   we,   our,  or
 us  on a consolidated basis) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements include projections, predictions, expectations or statements as to beliefs or
future events or results or refer to other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report are based on various factors and were derived using numerous assumptions. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by words
like  may,   will,   should,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   intend,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential,  or
 continue,  or the negative of those words and other comparable words. You should be aware that those statements reflect only our predictions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties should materialize, or if any one or more of our
material underlying assumptions should prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated, or projected. You should bear this in mind when reading this quarterly report and not place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements. Commerce Union s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Factors that might cause such differences include, but
are not limited to:      

The possibility that our asset quality would decline or that we experience greater loan losses than anticipated;        

Increased levels of other real estate, primarily as a result of foreclosures;        

The impact of liquidity needs on our results of operations and financial condition;        

Competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers;        

Economic conditions in the local markets where we operate;        

The negative impact on profitability imposed on us by a compressed net interest margin on loans and other extensions of credit, which affects our ability to lend profitably and to price loans effectively in the face of
competitive pressures;        

The effect of legislative or regulatory developments, including changes in laws concerning banking, securities, taxes, insurance, and other aspects of the financial services industry;    

Our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified banking professionals;        

A significant number of our customers failing to perform under their loans and other terms of credit agreements;        

The growing concern on the impact of a future rise in interest rates, affecting both our pricing of credit and our investments;        

Failure to attract or retain stable deposits at reasonable cost that is competitive with the larger international, national, and regional financial service providers with which we compete;    

International, national, and local disasters such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or the effects of pandemic flu, or other pandemic illness;    

Incorrect responses to, or assumptions based on, experiences and circumstances, such as responses to known or perceived changes in the economy;    

Volatility and disruption in financial, credit, and securities markets;        

Deterioration in the financial markets that may result in other-than-temporary impairment charges relating to securities owned by the Reliant Bank;    

The effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, and other regulatory agencies; and        

The effect of fiscal and governmental policies of the United States federal government.      You
should also consider carefully the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of Part II of this Form 10-Q referencing Item 1A of Part I of our most recent Form 10-K, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ
from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The risks discussed in this quarterly report are factors that, individually or in the
aggregate, management believes could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider
such disclosures to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Factors not here or there listed may develop or, if currently extant, we may not have yet recognized them.  
 The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact
of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED) AND DECEMBER 31, 2015   
 (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share amounts)  
 NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION    The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc, its wholly owned subsidiary, Reliant Bank (the  Bank ), the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Commerce Union Mortgage Services, Inc. (inactive and terminated
in September 2016) and Reliant Investments, LLC (inactive and terminated in September 2016), and the Bank s majority controlled subsidiary, Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC, collectively (the  Company ). As described in the notes to our
annual financial statements, Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC is considered a variable interest entity for which the Bank is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and to general practices in the banking industry.  
 The consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
included herein have not been audited. See Note 11 related to the business combination occurring during 2015 and the related financial presentation. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2015 audited
consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The Company evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

   The following table shows available for sale securities with unrealized losses and their estimated fair value
aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2015:      
   Management has the intent and ability to hold all securities in an unrealized loss position for the foreseeable
future, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date and/or market rates decline. There were 55 and 105 securities in an unrealized
loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows:  
  Commercial, industrial and agricultural:  The commercial, industrial and agricultural loan portfolio segment includes loans to commercial
customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansion projects. Collection risk in this portfolio is driven by the creditworthiness of underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow
from customers  business operations. Commercial, industrial and agricultural loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of
borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or
inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be
substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.     Multi-family and commercial real
estate:  Multi-family and commercial real estate and multi-family loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial, industrial and agricultural loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are
viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.    Commercial real estate lending typically involves
higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may
be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the Company s
exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. The Company also utilizes third-party experts to
provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting the market areas it serves. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. Non-owner occupied
commercial real estate loans are loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of
repayment comes from third party, nonaffiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. These loans are made to finance income-producing properties such as apartment buildings, office and
industrial buildings, and retail properties. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are loans where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and business activities conducted by the party, or affiliate of the
party, who owns the property.

  NOTE 3 - LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONTINUED)  
   
   Construction and land development:  Loans for non-owner-occupied real estate
construction or land development are generally repaid through cash flow related to the operation, sale or refinance of the property. The Company also finances construction loans for owner-occupied properties. A portion of the Company s
construction and land portfolio segment is comprised of loans secured by residential product types (residential land and single-family construction). With respect to construction loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner
occupied properties that the Company may originate from time to time, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. Construction and land development loans are
underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates, market sales activity, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally
based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the
ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained.
These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general
economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.     1-4 family residential real estate:  Residential real estate loans
represent loans to consumers or investors to finance a residence. These loans are typically financed on 15 to 30 year amortization terms, but generally with shorter maturities of 5 to 15 years. Many of these loans are extended to borrowers to
finance their primary or secondary residence. Loans to an investor secured by a 1-4 family residence will be repaid from either the rental income from the property or from the sale of the property. This loan segment also includes closed-end home
equity loans that are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence. This allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Loans in this portfolio segment are underwritten and approved based on a number of credit
quality criteria including limits on maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV), minimum credit scores, and maximum debt to income. Real estate market values as of the time the loan is made directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in
these residential property values impact the depth of potential losses in this portfolio segment.     1-4 family HELOC:  This loan
segment includes open-end home equity loans that are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence. This allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home utilizing a revolving line of credit. These loans are
underwritten and approved based on a number of credit quality criteria including limits on maximum LTV, minimum credit scores, and maximum debt to income. Real estate market values as of the time the loan is made directly affect the amount of credit
extended and, in addition, changes in these residential property values impact the depth of potential losses in this portfolio segment. Because of the revolving nature of these loans as well as the fact that many represent second mortgages, this
portfolio segment can contain more risk than the amortizing 1-4 family residential real estate loans.

   Consumer:  The consumer loan portfolio segment includes non-real estate secured direct
loans to consumers for household, family, and other personal expenditures. Consumer loans may be secured or unsecured and are usually structured with short or medium term maturities. These loans are underwritten and approved based on a number of
consumer credit quality criteria including limits on maximum LTV on secured consumer loans, minimum credit scores, and maximum debt to income. Many traditional forms of consumer installment credit have standard monthly payments and fixed repayment
schedules of one to five years. These loans are made with either fixed or variable interest rates that are based on specific indices. Installment loans fill a variety of needs, such as financing the purchase of an automobile, a boat, a recreational
vehicle, or other large personal items, or for consolidating debt. These loans may be unsecured or secured by an assignment of title, as in an automobile loan, or by money in a bank account. In addition to consumer installment loans, this portfolio
segment also includes secured and unsecured personal lines of credit as well as overdraft protection lines. Loans in this portfolio segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures.

  Individually impaired loans by class of loans were as follows at December 31, 2015:  
   
   The average balances of impaired loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as
follows:      
   The Company utilizes a risk grading system to monitor the credit quality of the Company s commercial loan
portfolio which consists of commercial, industrial and agricultural, commercial real estate and construction loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 9. Grades 1 - 5 are pass credits, grade 6 is special mention, grade 7 is substandard, grade 8 is
doubtful and grade 9 is loss. A description of the risk grades are as follows:    Grade 1 - Minimal Risk (Pass)  
 This grade includes loans to borrowers with a strong financial position and history of profits and cash flows sufficient to service the debt.
These borrowers have well defined sources of primary/secondary repayment, conservatively leveraged balance sheets and the ability to access a wide range of financing alternatives. Collateral securing these loans is negotiable, of sufficient value
and in possession of the Company. Risk of loss is unlikely.

  NOTE 3 - LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Grade 2 - High Quality (Pass)  
 This grade includes loans to borrowers with a strong financial condition reflecting dependable net profits and cash flows. The borrower has
verifiable liquid net worth providing above average asset protection. An identifiable market exists for the collateral. Risk of loss is unlikely.  
 Grade 3 - Above Average (Pass)  
 This grade includes loans to borrowers with a balance sheet that reflects a comfortable degree of leverage and liquidity. Borrowers are
profitable and have a sustained record of servicing debt. An identifiable market exists for the collateral, but liquidation could take up to one year. Risk of loss is unlikely.  
 Grade 4 - Average (Pass)    This
grade includes loans to borrowers with a financial condition that is satisfactory and comparable to industry standards. The borrower has verifiable net worth, providing over time, average asset protection. Borrower cash flows are sufficient to
satisfy debt service requirements. Risk of loss is below average.    Grade 5 - Acceptable (Management Attention) (Pass)  
 This grade includes loans to borrowers whose loans are performing, but sources of repayment are not documented by the current credit analysis.
There are some declining trends in margins, ratios and/or cash flow. Guarantor(s) have strong net worth(s), but assets may be concentrated in real estate or other illiquid investments. Risk of loss is average.  
 Grade 6 - Special Mention  
 Special mention assets have potential weaknesses that may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the
Company s position at some future date. These assets pose elevated risk, but their weakness does not yet justify a substandard classification. Borrowers may be experiencing adverse operating trends (declining revenues or margins) or an ill
proportioned balance sheet (e.g., increasing inventory without an increase in sales, high leverage, tight liquidity). Adverse economic or market conditions, such as interest rate increases or the entry of a new competitor, may also support a special
mention rating. Nonfinancial reasons for rating a credit exposure special mention include management problems, pending litigation, an ineffective loan agreement or other material structural weakness, and any other significant deviation from prudent
lending practices. The special mention rating is designed to identify a specific level of risk and concern about asset quality .  Although a special mention asset has a higher probability of default than a pass asset, its default is not
imminent.

  NOTE 3 - LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Grade 7 - Substandard  
 A   substandard   extension of credit is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Extensions of credit so classified should have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will
sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits, does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard. Substandard assets have a high
probability of payment default, or they have other well-defined weaknesses. They require more intensive supervision by Company management. Substandard assets are generally characterized by current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt
service coverage, inadequate liquidity, or marginal capitalization. Repayment may depend on collateral or other credit risk mitigation.  
 Grade 8 - Doubtful    An extension
of credit classified   doubtful   has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts,
conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit, its
classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceedings, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, or
refinancing plans. Generally, the doubtful classification should not extend for a long period of time because in most cases the pending factors or events that warranted the doubtful classification should be resolved either positively or negatively
in a reasonable period of time.    Grade 9 - Loss  
 Extensions of credit classified   loss   are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as
bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the credit has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial
recovery may be affected in the future. Amounts classified loss should be promptly charged off. The Company will not attempt long term recoveries while the credit remains on the Company s books. Losses should be taken in the period in which
they surface as uncollectible. With loss assets, the underlying borrowers are often in bankruptcy, have formally suspended debt repayments, or have otherwise ceased normal business operations. Once an asset is classified loss, there is little
prospect of collecting either its principal or interest.    Non-commercial purpose loans are initially assigned a default loan grade of 99
(Pass) and are risk graded (Grade 6, 7, or 8) according to delinquency status when applicable.

  NOTE 4 - FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  
     Financial accounting standards relating to fair value measurements
establish a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  

Level 1 
 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.    

Level 2 
 Inputs to the valuation methodology include:        

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;        

Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;        

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;        

Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by the observable market data by correlation or other means.    
 If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability.      

Level 3 
 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.    
 An asset s or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  
 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  
  Securities available for sale:  The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally
recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying
on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). The Company obtains fair value measurements for securities available for sale from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider
observable data that may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, cash flows and reference data, including market research publications, among other
things.     Interest rate swaps:  The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined based on discounted future cash flows.

  NOTE 4 - FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)  
   
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is,
the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis include the following:     Impaired Loans : The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the
allowance for loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected payments using the loan s effective rate as the discount rate or recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a
combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such
adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.     Other real
estate owned:  The fair value of other real estate owned is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income
approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification
of the inputs for determining fair value.    There were no changes in valuation methodologies used during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.    The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable
value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company s valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.    Fair value estimates involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could
significantly affect the estimates.

discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. Fair value of debt is based on discounted cash flows using current rates for similar financing.

  NOTE 5 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
 In 2006, the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Bank approved the Commerce Union Bank Stock Option Plan (the  Plan ). The
Plan provides for the granting of stock options, and authorizes the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of such options, for up to 625,000 shares of common stock to employees and organizers of the Company. As part of a reorganization, all
Commerce Union Bank options were replaced with Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. options with no change in terms. On March 10, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Option
Plan that permits the grant of awards of up to 1,250,000 shares of the Company common stock in the form of stock options. As part of the merger with Reliant Bank, all outstanding stock options of Reliant Bank were converted to stock options of
Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. under this plan.    Under the Stock Option Plan, stock option awards may be granted in the form of incentive
stock options or non-statutory stock options, and are generally exercisable for up to ten years following the date such option awards are granted. Exercise prices of incentive stock options must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of
the common stock on the grant date.    On June 18, 2015, the shareholders of Commerce Union approved the Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.
2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of up to 900,000 shares of common stock in the form of stock options, restricted stock grants or grants for performance-based compensation.

  The fair values of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
were determined using the following assumptions as of the grant date:      
   NOTE 6 - REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  
 The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and,
additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also
subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of September 30, 2016, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.  
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital
distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category.  
 In July 2013, the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank. The final
rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in  Basel III: A Global Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems  (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
   Under these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based
capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules implementing Basel III became effective on January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and a new common equity tier 1 ratio. In addition,
these rules refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.

in on January 1, 2016, at a rate of .625% per year. The buffer becomes fully phased in on January 1, 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses
if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer.    Actual and required capital amounts and ratios are presented below as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

  NOTE 9 - DERIVATIVES  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company entered into swap agreements totaling $6,300 to effectively convert fixed
municipal security yields to floating rates. This hedge is intended to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the underlying hedged item by mitigating the risk of changes in fair value based on fluctuations in interest rates.  
 The total notional amount of swap agreements was $21,505 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30,
2016, the contracts had fair values totaling $1,743 recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2015, the contracts had fair values totaling $77 recorded in other assets and $572 recorded in other liabilities.  
 The derivative instruments held by the Company are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss on the
derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the available-for-sale securities attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2016, the Company s fair value hedges are effective and are not
expected to have a significant impact on net income over the next twelve months.    NOTE 10 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

variable interest, (2) amends the criteria for determining whether a limited partnership is a variable interest entity and (3) eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership in the voting model.
ASU 2015-02 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
  ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs   requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial
statements.     ASU 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to an SEC Staff Announcement that given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs
related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit
arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. This did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805)   Simplifying the
Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   requires that adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment
amounts are determined. Furthermore, the income statement effects of such adjustments, if any, must be calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that
would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. Under previous guidance, adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period
are to be recognized retrospectively. ASU 2015-16 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
  ASU 2016-1,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities   (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without
readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value
that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has
elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale. ASU 2016-1 will
be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.  
  ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)   requires lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to
make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does
not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors. ASU 2016-1 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and will require transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or
entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements.

   ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement during the period in which they
occur. Previously, such excess tax benefits were recorded as additional paid-in capital, and tax deficiencies were charged to additional paid in capital to the extent of prior excess tax benefits. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be
classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either
estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected early adoption of this update and as a
result recognized in income tax expense an excess tax benefit of approximately $531 related to the exercise of stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on
available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 will be effective beginning on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial
statements.    NOTE 11 - BUSINESS COMBINATION  
 On March 10, 2015, the shareholders of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. ( Commerce Union ) approved a merger between Commerce
Union Bank and Reliant Bank ( Reliant ) which became effective on April 1, 2015 ( the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share and option to purchase a share of Reliant common stock converted
into the right to receive 1.0213 shares of Commerce Union common stock. After the Merger was completed, Commerce Union s shareholders owned approximately 44.5% of the common stock of the Company and Reliant Bank s shareholders owned
approximately 55.5% of the common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis.    The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using
the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805-10 Business Combinations. As such, for accounting purposes, Reliant was considered to have acquired Commerce Union in this transaction.  
 As a result, the historical financial statements of the Company prior to April 1, 2015 are the historical financial statements of Reliant.
The assets and liabilities of Commerce Union as of the effective date of the Merger were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and added to those of Reliant. Any excess of purchase price over the net estimate fair values of the acquired
assets and assumed liabilities of Commerce Union was allocated to all identifiable intangibles assets. Any remaining excess was then allocated to goodwill. Goodwill arising from the acquisition consists primarily of synergies of the combined
operations. The goodwill resulting from this business combination is not deductible for tax purposes.

 During the second quarter of 2016, the Company began transitioning most of its out-of-market branches to another bank and closed its Florida
office. On April 5, 2016, the Bank entered into an agreement with BBMC Mortgage, LLC ( BBMC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bridgeview Bank Group. Under this agreement, the Bank ceased operations of its mortgage lending offices in
Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky, and a support office in Brentwood, Tennessee. Employees of the Bank in these locations became employees of BBMC, and BBMC assumed certain lease obligations of the Bank in connection with these locations. The employees
who transitioned from the Bank to BBMC did not have non-compete agreements with the Bank and were released from any existing non-solicitation agreements, provided that no customers for whom the Bank has funded residential mortgage loans will be
refinanced by BBMC for a minimum period of 180 days from funding. Furthermore, BBMC will not solicit any Bank employees other than the employees at these locations. The transition of these offices and related personnel was completed on
April 30, 2016. The Company received no consideration in connection with the agreement.    NOTE 13 - GAIN CONTINGENCY  
 In September 2016, as part of a plea agreement, a federal court ordered restitution of $935 to the Company related to loans made in reliance on
fraudulent or inaccurate loan application data provided by a borrower who is now a defendant in a federal criminal proceeding. The amount of restitution will represent loan recoveries of $794 and interest income of $141. The funds are currently
being held in escrow pending final sentencing that is scheduled for December. Should the Judge not approve the plea agreement, the amount of restitution could be affected. Therefore, the Company will not recognize any amount in the consolidated
financial statements until it is received.

   ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    In the following section the terms  Company  means  Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.  and  Bank  means  Reliant
Bank.  The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial position and operating results. This discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein along with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 28, 2016. Amounts in the narrative are shown in thousands, except for economic and
demographic information, numbers of shares, per share amounts and as otherwise noted.     Critical Accounting Policies   
 The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
conform to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available
information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. The allowance for loan losses and fair value of financial instruments are
particularly subject to change.    Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Accounting policies are described throughout
this document which includes the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies require our judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established policies and control
procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an
appropriate manner. The following is a brief summary of the more significant policies.     Principles of Consolidation   
 The consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the three months ended September 30,
2015, include the accounts of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliant Bank (the  Bank ), the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Commerce Union Mortgage Services, Inc. (inactive and terminated in September
2016) and Reliant Investments, LLC (inactive and terminated in September 2016), and the Bank s majority controlled subsidiary, Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC, collectively (the  Company ). The consolidated financial statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 include the accounts of the Company after the reverse merger described below for the six months ended September 30, 2015 and the accounts of Reliant Bank only, with its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliant
Investments, LLC and it s 51% controlled subsidiary Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC, for the three months ended March 31, 2015. As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC is considered
a variable interest entity for which the Bank is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
 During 2011, the Bank and another entity organized Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC referred to above for the purpose of improving the Bank s mortgage
operations. Under the related operating agreement, the non-controlling member receives 70% of the profits of the mortgage venture, and the Bank receives 30% of the profits once the non-controlling member recovers its aggregate losses. The
non-controlling member is responsible for 100% of the mortgage venture s net losses. As of September 30, 2016, the cumulative losses to date totaled $2,865. Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC will have to generate net income of this amount
before the Company will participate in future earnings.     Purchased Loans   
 The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses on purchased loans based on credit deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date. In accordance with the
accounting guidance for business combinations, because we recorded all acquired loans at fair value as of the date of the reverse merger (discussed below), we did not establish an allowance  
      44  

Table of Contents  

for loan losses on any of the loans we purchased as of the acquisition date as any credit deterioration evident in the loans was included in the determination of the acquisition date fair values.
For purchased credit-impaired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, management establishes an allowance for loan losses subsequent to the date of acquisition by re-estimating expected cash flows on these loans on a quarterly basis, with any decline
in expected cash flows due to a credit triggering impairment recorded as provision for loan losses. The allowance established is the excess of the loan s carrying value over the present value of projected future cash flows, discounted at the
current accounting yield of the loan or the fair value of collateral (less estimated costs to sell) for collateral dependent loans. These cash flow evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, all of which may be
susceptible to significant change. While the determination of specific cash flows involves estimates, each estimate is unique to the individual loan, and none is individually significant. For non-purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in the
reverse merger and that are accounted for under ASC 310-20, the historical loss estimates are based on the historical losses experienced by Reliant Bank for loans with similar characteristics as those acquired other than purchased credit-impaired
loans. We record an allowance for loan losses only when the calculated amount exceeds the remaining credit mark established at acquisition.     Allowance
for Loan Losses     The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the
allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using historical loan loss experience, the
nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, current economic conditions (national and local), and other factors such as changes in interest rates, portfolio concentrations,
changes in the experience, ability, and depth of the lending function, levels of and trends in charged-off loans, recoveries, past-due loans and volume and severity of classified loans. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The
specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The entire allowance is available for any loan
that, in management s judgment, should be charged off.    A loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected. All classified
loans and loans on non-accrual status are individually evaluated for impairment. Factors considered in determining if a loan is impaired include the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the risk rating of the loan
and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the
loan s existing rate or at the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Interest payments on impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless the principal amount is
deemed fully collectible, in which case interest is recognized on a cash basis. When recognition of interest income on a cash basis is appropriate, the amount of income recognized is limited to what would have been accrued on the remaining principal
balance at the contractual rate. Cash payments received over this limit, and not applied to reduce the loans remaining principal balance, are recorded as recoveries of prior charge-offs until these charge-offs have been fully recovered.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments     Fair values of
financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note to the consolidated financial statements. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.

   COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND
2015      Merger Between Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. and Reliant Bank   
 On March 10, 2015, Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. approved a merger with Reliant Bank which became effective on April 1, 2015
( the Merger ). Each outstanding share and option to purchase a share of Reliant Bank common stock converted into the right to receive 1.0213 shares of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. common stock. After the Merger was completed,
Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. s shareholders owned approximately 44.5% of the common stock of the Company and Reliant Bank s shareholders owned approximately 55.5% of the common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis.  
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805-10
Business Combinations.    As such, for accounting purposes, Reliant Bank was considered to be acquiring Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. in this transaction.
As a result of the Merger, the historical financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, of the Company include the historical financial statements of Reliant Bank for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and Commerce
Union Bancshares, Inc. for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The assets and liabilities of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. as of the effective date of the Merger were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and added to those
of Reliant Bank. Any excess of purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. were allocated to all identifiable intangibles assets. Any remaining excess was then
allocated to goodwill.    In periods following the Merger, the comparative historical financial statements of the Company are those of Reliant Bank prior to
the Merger. These consolidated financial statements include the results attributable to the operations of Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. beginning on April 1, 2015.  
 Merger expenses totaled $14 and $74 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $214 and $840 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These expenses were related to various professional fees for legal, accounting and other consultants. These and other factors that contributed to the Company s earnings results for the
periods indicated are discussed in more detail below.     Earnings   
 Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to $2,368 and $6,965, or $0.31 and $0.92 per basic share for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,833 and $4,047, or $0.26 and $0.67 per basic share for the same periods in 2015. Diluted net income attributable to shareholders per share was $0.30 and $0.91 per diluted share and $0.25 and
$0.65 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The largest components of the improvement from the previous three and nine months include a 1.50% and 28.31%, respectively, increase in net
interest income of $116 and $5,430, respectively, and a decrease in non-interest expenses of $1,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The largest factors offsetting the improvement was a decrease
in non-interest income of $2,444 and $1,007 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and an increase in non-interest expense of $1,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.

   Net Interest Income   
 Net interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interest-bearing
liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues. The following table sets forth the amount of our average balances, interest income or interest expense for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
and the average interest rate for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 (dollars in thousands):  

47  

Table of Contents  

Table Assumptions     Average loan balances are inclusive of nonperforming loans. Yields computed on
tax-exempt instruments are on a tax equivalent basis. Net interest spread is calculated as the yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income
calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets for the period. Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning
assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. Changes not due solely to volume or rate
changes have been allocated to volume change and rate change in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each category.

    Analysis     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded net
interest income of approximately $7.8 million and $24.6 million, respectively, which resulted in a net interest margin (net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets) of 3.98% and 4.20%, respectively. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net interest income of approximately $7.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, which resulted in a net interest margin of 4.03% and 4.00%, respectively. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net interest spread was 3.86% and 4.09%, respectively and 3.94% and 3.91%, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a contributing factor to the increase in our net interest
income was the payoff of a loan previously carried as purchase credit impaired. The payoff resulted in a $619 increase in our net interest income for the period. This was partially offset by a $165 reversal of interest due to nonaccrual loans.  
 Our year-over-year average loan volume increased by approximately 30.0% from the first nine months of 2015 to the first nine months of 2016. Our combined loan
and loan fee yield increased from 5.03% to 5.17% for the first nine months of 2015 compared to 2016, respectively, while our combined loan and loan fee yield decreased from 5.04% to 4.85% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 2016,
respectively.    Our cost of funds increased from 0.42% to 0.43% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2016,
respectively. Our cost of funds remained constant at 0.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. Our cost of interest-bearing liabilities has held fairly constant over the periods presented. We also experienced a 44.0%
increase in our average non-interest bearing deposits from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 2016, and a 59.2% increase in our average non-interest bearing deposits from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 2016. These
increases were the result of the Merger that occurred on April 1, 2015 and our continuing initiative to grow low cost core deposits.    We continue to
deploy various asset and liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations. We believe margin expansion over both the short and the long term will be challenging due to continued pressure on earning asset yields during
this extended period of low interest rates. Loan pricing for creditworthy borrowers is very competitive in our markets and has limited our ability to increase pricing on new and renewed loans over the last several quarters.  
  Provision for Loan Losses     The provision for loan losses
represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for loan losses that, in management s evaluation, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. Based upon management s assessment
of the loan portfolio, we adjust our allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis to an amount deemed appropriate to adequately cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  
 Based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio, we believe the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of probable losses existing in
the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016. While policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well as the resultant provision for loan losses charged to operations, are considered adequate by management, they are
necessarily approximate and imprecise. There are factors beyond our control, such as conditions in the local and national economy, local real estate market, or particular industry or borrower-specific conditions, which may materially negatively
impact our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and, thus, the resulting provision for loan losses.    We recorded a provision
for loan losses of $145 and $760, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to no provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a negative provision for loan losses of $500
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our provision increase was primarily the result of loan growth that we have experienced. The lower provision for loan losses (including the negative provision) experienced in the prior year was due
to the continued improvement of credit-quality factors in our loan portfolio, continued recoveries and low charge-offs.

   Non-Interest Income   
 Our non-interest income is composed of several components, some of which vary significantly between periods. The following is a summary of our non-interest
income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):      
   The most significant reason for the increases during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 relate to
the Merger between Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. and Reliant Bank that was effective April 1, 2015. Following is a description of certain components of non-interest income and additional reasons for fluctuations during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.    Service charges on deposit accounts generally reflect customer growth trends
but also are impacted by changes in our fee pricing to help attract and retain customers.

  Securities gains and losses will fluctuate from period to period and are often attributable to various balance
sheet risk strategies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold securities classified as available for sale totaling $20,036, including $18,978 sold during the third quarter of 2016. The Company recognized a gain on
sales of securities classified as available for sale of $296 and $356 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Proceeds from sales during the third quarter of 2016 were reinvested in higher yielding securities with
comparable interest rate and credit risk. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Bank sold securities that were previously classified as held to maturity and recognized a loss on sale of $381. All other securities classified as
held to maturity were transferred to available-for-sale during the first quarter of 2015.    Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, consists of fees from the
origination and sale of mortgage loans. These mortgage fees are for loans originated and subsequently sold to third-party investors. All of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer. Generally, mortgage related revenue increases in
lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets. Mortgage-related revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes
and as changes occur to our mortgage operations. Gains on mortgage loans sold, net, amounted to $551 and $5,675 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,454 and $7,987 for the same periods in the prior year. As
discussed further in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, gains on mortgage loans sold are generally recognized at the time of a loan sale corresponding to the transfer of risk. We completed the transition of a majority of our
out-of-market mortgage loan production offices during the three months ended June 30, 2016 to better focus our marketing and other resources in our core Middle Tennessee markets. The decline in gains on mortgage loans sold during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 was directly attributable to the transition.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
recognized a gain on sale of other real estate of $145 and $301, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold the remaining two properties in our other real estate portfolio, of which one was sold during the third
quarter of 2016. Also, we recognized a gain previously deferred related to the payoff of a loan financing a previous other real estate sale.    Noninterest
income also includes appreciation in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance which was $194 and $557 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $162 and $378 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, the increase in earnings on these bank-owned life insurance policies primarily resulted from the Merger effective April 1, 2015. At
the end of June 2015, an additional $4.0 million of bank-owned life insurance was purchased with terms similar to our existing policies. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an additional $4.0 million of bank-owned life
insurance was purchased with terms similar to our existing policies. The assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we receive (i.e., increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the
policies) is dependent upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the underlying investments that support the policies. Earnings on these policies generally are not taxable.  
 Our brokerage revenue is solely based on commissions received from established referral relationships and fluctuate based on related activity.  
 Rental income relates to rent received on foreclosed properties and is minimal for the periods presented.

   Non-Interest Expense   
 The following is a summary of our non-interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):  
   
   The most significant reason for the changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relate to the Merger
between Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc. and Reliant Bank that was effective April 1, 2015. Following is a description of certain components of non-interest expense and additional reasons for fluctuations during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.    Salaries and employee benefits decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the same period in 2015 and increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The primary reason for the change during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015 was a result of the Merger effective April 1, 2015. The decrease during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was a result of a decrease in compensation due to transitioning
several of our out-of-market mortgage offices to another bank. The decrease was partially offset by general increases in compensation for our other staff.  
      52

Certain of our facilities are leased while there are others that we own. Primarily, occupancy costs decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, occupancy costs decreased. These decreases are due to transitioning several of our out-of-market mortgage offices to another bank. These decreases were
partially offset by inflationary increases in the lease of our Franklin operations center as well as increases in rent for other mortgage loan production offices.  
 Information technology costs increased when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the similar period of 2015, substantially due to the
Merger effective April 1, 2015. Information technology costs decreased when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the similar period of 2015. The Company operated on two core data processing systems until mid-November 2015
when the conversion to one core system occurred. Since November 2015, core service costs have declined as a result of this conversion. The decline for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was partially offset by purchases of
other information technology products and services during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Advertising and public relations costs
decreased when comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to similar periods of 2015, by $246 and $319, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to transitioning several of our out-of-market mortgage offices to another
bank. These decreases have been partially offset by cost increases attributable to our current customer acquisition strategy.    Audit, legal and consulting
costs decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to similar periods of 2015 due to a reduction in merger-related expenses offset partially by increased costs associated with being a public company.  
 Our FDIC expense is based on our outstanding liabilities for the period multiplied by a factor determined by the FDIC, mainly driven by our most recent
regulatory rating and certain financial performance factors. Our FDIC expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the Merger effective April 1, 2015. The remainder of
the increase for the nine months and the increase for the three month ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 relates to our increase in average liabilities which is the base for determining our premiums. The costs
associated with the increase in average liabilities was slightly offset by an improved combined rate post-merger.    We recorded a provision for losses on
other real estate of $17 and $70 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. These provisions related to one property held in our other real estate portfolio. As mentioned previously, this remaining property was sold during the
third quarter of 2016. We recorded no provision during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a provision of $110 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 relating to one property that was held in our other real estate
portfolio.    Other operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 mainly
due to the Merger effective April 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases in loan-related expenses such as processing costs relating to our mortgage operations as volume decreased and our transitioning of several of our
out-of-market mortgage offices to another bank.     Income Taxes   
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $619 and $1,775, respectively, compared to $558 and $1,644,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company files separate Federal tax returns for the operations of the banking and mortgage banking operations. The taxable income or losses of the mortgage banking
operations are included in the respective returns of the Bank and non-controlling members for Federal purposes. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company began consolidating the results of the Bank and the mortgage banking operations in its tax
filings with the State of Tennessee. Results of the mortgage banking operations were previously reported on the individual state returns of the Bank and mortgage banking operation s non-controlling members.  
 Our income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects an effective income tax rate of 21.8% (exclusive of a tax benefit
from our mortgage banking operations of $42 on pre-tax loss of $647) and 20.6% (exclusive of a tax benefit from our mortgage banking operations of $35 on pre-tax loss of $542),  
      53  

Table of Contents  

respectively, compared to 27.8% (exclusive of a tax benefit from our mortgage banking operations of $148 on pre-tax income of $359) and 30.7% (exclusive of a tax benefit from our mortgage banking
operations of $148 on pre-tax income of $256) for the comparable periods of 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized excess tax benefits of $107 and $531, respectively, related to the exercise of
stock options, thereby reducing our effective tax rate as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank entered into an interest-free loan agreement and
recognizes a state tax credit in the amount of $217 each quarter beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Our effective tax rate represents our blended federal and state rate of 38.29% reduced by the impact of anticipated favorable permanent
differences between our book and taxable income such as bank-owned life insurance, income earned on tax-exempt securities and certain federal and state tax credits. The non-deductibility of certain merger related expenses also drives
fluctuations in our effective tax rate.    Noncontrolling Interest in Net Income (Loss) of Subsidiary   
 Our noncontrolling interest in net income (loss) of subsidiary is solely attributable to Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC. Reliant Bank has a 51% voting interest
in this venture. Under the terms of the related operating agreement, the noncontrolling member receives 70% of the profits of the mortgage venture, and the Bank receives 30% of the profits. The noncontrolling member is responsible for 100% of the
mortgage venture s net losses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was transitioning most of its out-of-market mortgage offices to another bank (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere herein). The venture incurred net losses of $605 and $507, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $507 and $404, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. These amounts are included in our consolidated results. See Note 8 for segment reporting in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.  
  COMPARISON OF BALANCE SHEETS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015   
  Overview     The Company s total assets were $920,020
at September 30, 2016 and $876,404 at December 31, 2015. Our assets increased by 5.0% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The increase in assets from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, was substantially
attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $14.4 million; an increase in net loans of approximately $43.7 million, discussed further below; a net increase in our securities portfolio of $21.0 million discussed further below; and a
$4.6 million increase in bank-owned life insurance. These increases were offset by a decrease in our mortgage loans held for sale of $40.4 million. The Company s total liabilities were $810,788 at September 30, 2016 and $779,653 at
December 31, 2015, an increase of 4.0%. The increase in total liabilities from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, was substantially attributable to an increase in total deposits of $19.8 million and an increase in Federal Home
Loan Bank advances of $8.9 million. These and other components of our balance sheets are discussed further below.     Loans   
 Lending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability. The loan portfolio is the
largest component of earning assets, and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues. The absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are
expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets. As previously discussed the competition for quality loans in our markets has remained intense. Our goal is to steadily grow our loan portfolio, focusing on quality. This is
not always possible for various factors, including but not limited to, scheduled maturities or early payoffs exceeding new loan volume. Early payoffs typically increase in lowering rate environments as customers identify advantageous opportunities
for refinancing. We have been adding experienced lending officers to our staff to help with loan growth as the local market has continued to improve. Total loans, net, at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were $652,445 and
$608,747, respectively. This represented an increase of 7.2% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.    The table below provides a summary
of the loan portfolio composition for the dates noted (including purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans).

Table of Contents  

  Commercial loans above consist of commercial and industrial loans made to U.S. domiciled customers. These include
loans for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other expansionary projects. Commercial loans of $133,382 at September 30, 2016, decreased 7.2% compared to $143,770 as of December 31,
2015. Agricultural loans represent 13.3% of the total commercial, industrial and agricultural portfolio, and 2.7% of gross loans at September 30, 2016.  
 Real estate loans comprised 75.1% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016. Residential loans included in this category consist mainly of closed-end
loans secured by first and second liens that are not held for sale and revolving, open-end loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties extended under home equity lines of credit. The Company increased the residential portfolio from
December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Commercial loans included in the real estate category above include (in typical order of prominence) loans secured by non- owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties, loans secured by
owner-occupied nonfarm nonresidential properties, and loans secured by multi-family residential properties. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans of $217,166 at September 30, 2016, increased 7.1% compared to the $202,736 held as of
December 31, 2015. Real estate construction loans consist of 1-4 family residential construction loans, other construction loans, land loans, and loans secured by farmland. Construction lending also increased during 2015 and into the first nine
months of 2016, based on a strengthening local economy.    Consumer loans mainly consist of loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal
expenditures under revolving credit plans and other consumer loans. We have no credit card loans although we do offer credit cards to customers through a third party.  
 Our other loans consist mainly of loans to other depository institutions and were minimal for the periods presented.  
 The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for us. The following table sets forth the loans repricing or maturing within specific intervals at
September 30, 2016, excluding unearned net fees and costs.      
   The information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities or next repricing date of the individual
loans, including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity. Renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval, as well as modification of terms upon their maturity. Consequently, we believe this treatment
presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio.     Allowance for Loan Losses   
 We maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb the probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Loan losses are
charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using historical loan loss
experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, current economic conditions (national and local), and other factors such as changes in interest rates, portfolio
concentrations, changes in the experience, ability, and depth of the lending function, levels of and trends in charged-off loans, recoveries, past-due loans and volume and severity of classified loans. The allowance consists of specific and general
components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The entire allowance is
available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off.  
      56  

Table of Contents  

  A loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected. All classified loans and loans on
non-accrual status are individually evaluated for impairment. Factors considered in determining if a loan is impaired include the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the risk rating of the loan and economic
conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s
existing rate or at the fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Interest payments on impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless the principal amount is deemed fully
collectible, in which case interest is recognized on a cash basis. When recognition of interest income on a cash basis is appropriate, the amount of income recognized is limited to what would have been accrued on the remaining principal balance at
the contractual rate. Cash payments received over this limit, and not applied to reduce the loans remaining principal balance, are recorded as recoveries of prior charge-offs until these charge-offs have been fully recovered.  
 At September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $8,801 compared to $7,823 at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a
percentage of total loans was 1.3% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The allowance was adjusted upward from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This increase in our allowance for loan losses is directly
attributable to our loan growth. Charge-off and general economic activity has continued to improve for our area and our customers.

  While no portion of the allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the
entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following table summarizes our allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan category and loans in each category as a percentage of total loans, for the periods presented.
     
    Nonperforming Assets   
 Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans plus real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Non-performing loans by
definition consist of non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income. The
interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis, or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and
future payments are reasonably assured.    The following table provides information with respect to Company s non-performing assets.  

59  

Table of Contents  

  The increase in non-performing assets as of September 30, 2016, is primarily due to one agricultural lending
relationship becoming impaired due to low commodity prices and being moved to non-accrual status. We expect significant paydowns on this relationship during the fourth quarter of 2016 due to its seasonal nature.  
  Investment Securities and Other Earning Assets     The
investment securities portfolio is intended to provide the Company with adequate liquidity, meet customer collateral needs and, provide flexible asset/liability management and a source of stable income. The portfolio is structured with minimal
credit exposure to the Company and consists of securities classified as available-for-sale. All available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management deem it to be in our best interest.
Unrealized gains and losses on this portfolio are excluded from earnings, but are reported as other comprehensive income in a separate component of stockholders  equity, net of income tax. Premium amortization and discount accretion are
recognized as adjustments to interest income using the interest method. Realized gains or losses on sales are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted carrying value amount of the securities sold using the specific identification method.  
 Securities are a component of the Company s earning assets. Securities totaled $154,816 at September 30, 2016. This represents a 15.7% increase from
the December 31, 2015 total of $133,825. The increase is attributable to purchasing $47,391 securities available for sale during the nine months ended September 30 2016, offset by sales, principal paydowns and maturities of $28,074 during
the same period.    Restricted equity securities totaled $7,081 at September 30, 2016. This represents a 13.4% increase from the December 31, 2015
total of $6,244. Restricted securities consist of Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.

    Premises and Equipment   
 Premises and equipment, net, totaled $8,964 at September 30, 2016 compared to $9,196 at December 31, 2015, a net decrease of $232 or 2.5%. Asset
purchases amounted to approximately $496 during the first nine months of 2016 while related depreciation expense amounted to $728. At September 30, 2016, we operated from seven retail branch locations as well as two stand-alone mortgage loan
production offices and one commercial loan production office. Two of our bank branch locations, including our main office, are in Brentwood, Tennessee. Our other five bank branch locations are in Franklin, Springfield, Gallatin and Nashville,
Tennessee. Our commercial loan production office is in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. As of September 30, 2016, our mortgage loan production offices were located Hendersonville, Tennessee, as well as Timonium, Maryland. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company transitioned most of it out-of-market branches to another bank as more fully described in Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Until the Merger, all of our facilities were
leased. After the Merger, we own three branch and office facilities located in Robertson and Sumner counties of Tennessee.     Deposits   
 Deposits represent the Company s largest source of funds. The Company competes with other bank and nonbank institutions for deposits, as well as with a
growing number of non-deposit investment alternatives available to depositors such as money market funds and other brokerage investment products. Challenges to deposit growth include price changes on deposit products given movements in the interest
rate environment and other competitive pricing pressures, and customer preferences regarding higher-costing deposit products or non-deposit investment alternatives.  
      61  

Table of Contents  

  At September 30, 2016, total deposits were $659,856, an increase of $19,848, or 3.1%, compared to $640,008
at December 31, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, we increased non-interest bearing demand deposits by $28.4 million, or 25.5% and increased savings and money market deposits by $2.0 million, or 1.1%, while time deposits decreased by
$5.4 million, or 2.1%, and interest bearing demand deposits decreased $5.2 million, 5.4%. We are continuing to focus on growth of our non-interest bearing deposits and using alternative sources of funds to better manage our cost of funds. As of
September 30, 2016, non-interest bearing deposits represent 21.2% of total deposits.    The following table shows maturity of time deposits of $100 or
more by category based on time remaining until maturity at September 30, 2016.      
    Market and Liquidity Risk Management   
 Our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity,
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of asset/liability mix. Two
critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management.      Interest Rate Sensitivity   Interest rate
sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates.
ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements we use to
help us manage interest rate sensitivity include a gap analysis, an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity model. These measurements are used in conjunction with competitive pricing analysis and are further described below.  
   Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap Analysis   The rate sensitive position, or gap, is the difference in the volume of rate-sensitive assets and
liabilities, at a given time interval, including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity. The measurement of our interest rate sensitivity, or gap, is one of the three principal techniques we use in our
asset/liability management effort.    Our policy is to have 12 and 24-month cumulative repricing gaps that do not exceed 15% of assets. We were in
compliance with our policy as of September 30, 2016. Although we do monitor our gap on a periodic basis, we recognize the potential shortcomings of such a model. The static nature of the gap schedule makes it difficult to incorporate changes in
behavior that are caused by changes in interest rates. Also, although the periods of estimated and contractual repricing are identified in the analysis, the extent of repricing is not modeled in the gap schedule (i.e. whether repricing is expected
to move on a one-to-one or other basis in relationship to the market changes simulated). For these and other shortcomings, we rely more heavily on the earnings simulation model and the economic value of equity model discussed further below.  
      62  

Table of Contents  

    Earnings Simulation Model   We believe interest rate risk is effectively measured by our
earnings simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with simulated forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and 24 months. To limit interest rate risk, we have
guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in instantaneous changes to interest rates. We also periodically monitor simulations based on various rate scenarios such as non-parallel shifts in market
interest rates over time. For changes up or down in rates from management s flat interest rate forecast over the next 12 and 24 months, limits in the decline in net interest income are as follows:  
   
   We were in compliance with the earnings simulation model policies monitored by the Bank as of September 30, 2016,
indicating what we believe to be a fairly neutral profile.      Economic value of equity     Our economic value of equity model measures
the extent that estimated economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and
off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case economic value of equity.    To help monitor our related risk, we ve established the following
policy limits regarding simulated changes in our economic value of equity:      
   At September 30, 2016, our model results indicated that we were within these policy limits.  
 Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income
associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant
impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of
assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of  
      63  

Table of Contents  

  changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market
rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate
significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. Our ALCO reviews each of the above interest rate
sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing, and
capital policies.      Liquidity Risk Management      The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient
cash flows to satisfy loan demand, deposit withdrawals, and our other needs. Traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits. A bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of
its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations. Funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset
perspective. The liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions.  
 Changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position. We currently price deposits in response to market rates and our management intends to continue
this policy. If deposits are not priced in response to market rates, a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position.  
 Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly, being influenced by interest
rates, general economic conditions and competition. Additionally, debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity. We attempt to price our deposit products to meet
our asset/liability objectives consistent with local market conditions. Our ALCO is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs. Our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis.  
 The Company has established a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati which is secured by a blanket pledge of 1-4 family residential
mortgages, multi-family residential, and home equity loans, and available-for-sale securities.    At September 30, 2016, advances totaled $144,680
compared to $135,759 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in FHLB advances is attributable to obtaining lower cost funding for our loan portfolio growth.  
 At September 30, 2016, the scheduled maturities of our FHLB advances and interest rates were as follows (scheduled maturities will differ from scheduled
repayments):

   Capital   
 Stockholders  equity was $109,232 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $12,481, or 12.9%, from $96,751 at December 31, 2015. The Company raised
$4.6 million of capital through the exercise of Company stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The additional capital was pushed-down to the Bank and when combined with the accretion of earnings to capital led to an
increase in the Bank s September 30, 2016 Tier 1 leverage ratio to 10.94% compared with 9.88% at December 31, 2015 (see other ratios discussed further below). Common dividends of $1,489 (declared during the fourth quarter of 2015)
were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Banks as regulated institutions are required to meet certain levels of capital. The
Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the primary federal regulator for the Bank, has adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets. Financial institutions
are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines. We regularly review our capital adequacy to ensure compliance with these guidelines and to help ensure that
sufficient capital is available for current and future needs. It is management s intent to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return.  
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized,
and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are
limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2016, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution s category.    In July 2013,
the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank. The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in  Basel
III: A Global Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems  (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.    Under these rules, the
leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules implementing Basel III became effective on January 1, 2015,
and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and a new common equity tier 1 ratio. In addition, these rules refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of
Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.    Basel III establishes a  capital conservation buffer  of 2.5% which began phasing in on January 1,
2016, at a rate of .625% per year. The buffer becomes fully phased in on January 1, 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall
below minimum levels plus the buffer.    Actual and required capital amounts and ratios are presented below as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 for the Company and Bank.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the
measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets
and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. Although interest
rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation affects financial institutions 
increased cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may
adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders  equity. Commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase, and can reduce our earnings from such activities.

    Emerging Growth Company Status   
 The Company is an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ), and may take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if the Company complies with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, the Company may avail
itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as the Company is an emerging growth company. The Company will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though it may
cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a
market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million) or if total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion in a fiscal year. Management cannot predict if investors will find the Company s common stock less
attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and the Company s stock price may be more
volatile.    Further, the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until
private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial
accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The
Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period that allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, which means that
the financial statements included in this filing, as well as the financial statements we will file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to private companies. As a result, we will comply with
new or revised accounting standards to the same extent that compliance is required for non-public companies.

 The information required by this Item 3 is discussed in Part 1   Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading  Market and Liquidity Risk  on pages 62-64.     Item 
4.   Controls and Procedures.      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

     PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
 Commerce Union and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliant Bank, are periodically involved as a plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions in
the ordinary course of its business. Neither Commerce Union nor Reliant Bank is involved in any litigation that is expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Management believes that any claims pending
against Commerce Union or its subsidiaries are without merit or that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from them will not materially affect Reliant Bank s financial condition or Commerce Union s consolidated financial position.
      Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
 Investing in Commerce Union involves various risks which are particular to our company, our industry, and our market area. We believe all
significant risks to investors in Commerce Union have been outlined in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. However, other risks may
prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could materially affect our financial performance or condition. There has been no material change to our
risk factors as previously disclosed in the above described Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of
Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.     None.      
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.     Not applicable.  
    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
