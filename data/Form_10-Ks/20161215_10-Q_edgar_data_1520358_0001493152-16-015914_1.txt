Note
1 - Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation    

Nature
of Operations    

MamaMancini s
Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), (formerly known as Mascot Properties, Inc.) was organized on July 22, 2009 as a Nevada
corporation. The Company has a year-end of January 31.  

The
Company is a manufacturer and distributor of beef meatballs with sauce, turkey meatballs with sauce, beef meat loaf and
other similar meats and sauces. The Company s customers are located throughout the United States, with a large concentration
in the Northeast and Southeast.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
unaudited financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which
in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations
for the periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016 filed on April 21, 2016. The Company
assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements
for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined
in that context. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements but
does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results
of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the year ending January 31, 2017.  

The
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ,  during the first quarter of 2016. In accordance with the guidance,
$26,620 of unamortized debt issuance costs, associated with the Company s debt, were reclassified from other assets, as
previously reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2016, to line of credit, net.  

Going
Concern    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred
a net loss available to common shareholders of $580,435 and $3,101,343 during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Also, as of October 31, 2016, the Company had $655,030 in cash, and working capital of $1,857,956. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In their report for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2016, the Company s auditors have expressed an opinion that, as a result of the conditions noted, there is substantial
doubt regarding the ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management s
plans include using cash flows and/or refinancing transactions to reduce the Company s maturing debt and for
general working capital purposes. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory
obsolescence and the fair value of share-based payments.  

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements,
which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.  

Risks
and Uncertainties   

The
Company operates in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company s operations
are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business
failure.  

The
Company has experienced, and in the future expects to continue to experience, variability in sales and earnings. The factors expected
to contribute to this variability include, among others, (i) the cyclical nature of the grocery industry, (ii) general economic
conditions in the various local markets in which the Company competes, including the general downturn in the economy, and (iii)
the volatility of prices pertaining to food and beverages in connection with the Company s distribution of the product.
These factors, among others, make it difficult to project the Company s operating results on a consistent basis.  

Cash   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company held no cash equivalents at October 31, 2016 or January 31, 2016.  

The
Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial
institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company generally does not require
collateral to support customer receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the
outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information and existing economic conditions. The Company determines if
receivables are past due based on days outstanding, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible by management.
The maximum accounting loss from the credit risk associated with accounts receivable is the amount of the receivable recorded,
which is the face amount of the receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of October 31, 2016 and January 31,
2016, the Company had reserves of $2,000.  

Inventories   

Inventories
are stated at average cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) valuation method. Inventory was comprised of the following at
October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016:  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives.  

Asset
lives for financial statement reporting of depreciation are:  

Machinery
    and equipment  
      2-7
years    
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
      3-5
years    
 
      Leasehold
    improvements  
      3-10
years    

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

For
purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The carrying amount of the Company s
short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.  

Stock
Issuance Costs   

Stock
issuance costs are capitalized as incurred. Upon the completion of the offering, the stock issuance costs are reclassified to
equity and netted against proceeds. In the event the costs are in excess of the proceeds, the costs are recorded to expense. In
the case of an aborted offering, all costs are expensed. Offering costs recorded to equity for the nine months ended October 31,
2016 and 2015 were $0 and $351,219, respectively.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015
were $38,529 and $33,877, respectively. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015
were $106,316 and $77,435, respectively.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs   

The
Company classifies freight billed to customers as sales revenue and the related freight costs as general and administrative expenses.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company records revenue for products when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(2) the product is delivered, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the related
customer receivable is reasonably assured. There is no stated right of return for products.  

The
Company meets these criteria upon shipment.  

Expenses
such as slotting fees, sales discounts, and allowances are accounted for as a direct reduction of revenues as follows:  

Cost
of Sales   

Cost
of sales represents costs directly related to the production and manufacturing of the Company s products. Costs include
product development, freight, packaging, and print production costs.  

Advertising   

Costs
incurred for producing and communicating advertising for the Company are charged to operations as incurred. Producing and communicating
advertising expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $377,429 and $434,966, respectively. Producing
and communicating advertising expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,148,986 and $1,873,524, respectively.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation 
 ( ASC 718 ) which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation.
It defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts
for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718. The Company accounts for share-based payments to non-employees
in accordance with ASC 505-50   Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees  .  

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at
their fair value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.  

Share-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of share-based payment awards
issued to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the share-based payment, which is the more
readily determinable value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally
the vesting period. If an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed
in the period related to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling,
general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the services provided, in the condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Share-based payments issued to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded
as a reduction in additional paid in capital.  

For
the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, share-based compensation amounted to $115,277 and $81,242, respectively. For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, share-based compensation amounted to $488,039 and $199,051, respectively. During
the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015, share-based compensation included stock issuance costs of $84,547 paid in form
of warrants.  

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, when computing fair value of share-based payments, the Company has considered the following
variables:  

The
expected option term is computed using the  simplified  method as permitted under the provisions of ASC 718-10-S99.
The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does
not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.  

The
expected stock price volatility for the Company s stock options was determined by the historical volatilities for industry
peers and used an average of those volatilities. Risk free interest rates were obtained from U.S. Treasury rates for the applicable
periods.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

Earnings
per share ( EPS ) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term
is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options
or warrants.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23, diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of Paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260 10 55 23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and
purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: (a.) exercise of options and warrants
shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued,
(b.) the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
(See Paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.), and (c.) the incremental shares (the difference between the number
of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  

Since
the Company reflected a net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, the
effect of considering any common stock equivalents, if outstanding, would have been anti-dilutive and therefore is not included
in the table below.   

The
computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to common stockholders are as follows:  

(a)
- Weighted-average common shares outstanding.  

The
Company had the following potential common stock equivalents at October 31, 2016:  

The
Company had the following potential common stock equivalents at October 31, 2015:  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740,   Accounting for Income Taxes  . A deferred tax asset or liability
is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax
expense (benefit) results from the net change during the period of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  

The
Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2012.  

Reclassification   

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s core principle (issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB), is that a company will recognize
revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract,
estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each
separate performance obligation. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented
in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers
the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as
of the original effective date. This ASU is effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating its adoption method and the impact of the standard on its condensed
consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,   Interest
- Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The amendments in this ASU
require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for
debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments are effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments
is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The amendments should be applied on a retrospective
basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects
of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in
an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition
method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on
the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 during
the nine months ended October 31, 2016.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ,
which modifies existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under current inventory standards,
the market value requires consideration of replacement cost, net realizable value and net realizable value less an approximately
normal profit margin. The new guidance replaces market with net realizable value defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to
determine and consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2018. The amendment is to be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize, for all leases of 12 months or more, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the
right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of
financial statements better understand the nature of an entity s leasing activities. This ASU is effective for public reporting
companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (topic 718). The FASB
issued this update to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified,
including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing   (topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net)   (topic 606). These amendments provide additional
clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance
obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides
a customer with either a right to use an entity s intellectual property or a right to access an entity s intellectual
property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal
versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10
and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity s adoption of ASU 2014-09, which we intend to adopt for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients  , which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash
consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Joseph
Epstein Foods   

On
March 1, 2010, the Company entered into a five year agreement with Joseph Epstein Foods (the  Manufacturer ) who is
a related party. The Manufacturer is co-owned by the CEO and President of the Company. The Company analyzed the relationship with
the Manufacturer to determine if the Manufacturer is a variable interest entity as defined by FASB ASC 810   Consolidation  .
Based on this analysis, the Company has determined that the Manufacturer is a variable interest entity but the Company is not
the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity and therefore consolidation is not required. In addition, based on the
analysis the Company determined that the CEO and President of the Company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest
entity and bears the risk of loss. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company grants to the Manufacturer a revocable license
to use the Company s recipes, formulas, methods and ingredients for the preparation and production of Company s products,
for manufacturing the Company s product and all future improvements, modifications, substitutions and replacements developed
by the Company. The Manufacturer in turn grants the Company the exclusive right to purchase the product. Under the terms of the
agreement the Manufacturer agrees to manufacture, package, and store the Company s products and the Company has the right
to purchase products from one or more other manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. In September 2016, the agreement was amended
and restated to extend the agreement until August 2, 2021. The amended agreement contains a perpetual automatic renewal clause
for a period of one year after the expiration of the initial term. During the renewal period either party may cancel the contract
with written notice nine months prior to the termination date. The term of this Agreement shall expire on the later of the expiration
date or a date which is three (3) years following a Change of Control. For purposes of the agreement, a Change of Control shall
occur when a third party who is not currently a shareholder of the Company acquires control of at least fifty-one percent (51%)
of the voting shares of the Company.  

Under
the terms of the agreement if the Company specifies any change in packaging or shipping materials which results in the manufacturer
incurring increased expense for packaging and shipping materials or in the Manufacturer being unable to utilize obsolete packaging
or shipping materials in ordinary packaging or shipping, the Company agrees to pay as additional product cost the additional cost
for packaging and shipping materials and to purchase at cost such obsolete packaging and shipping materials. If the Company requests
any repackaging of the product, other than due to defects in the original packaging, the Company will reimburse the Manufacturer
for any labor costs incurred in repackaging. Per the agreement, all product delivery shipping costs are the expense of the Company.
The Company agreed with the Manufacturer at the end of the last fiscal year that Company would purchase a minimum of $963,000
of product each month and that any amount below that sum would be a charge of 12% of that shortfall each month. In return, the
Manufacturer obligated itself to offer the Company competitive prices and would not co-pack for other suppliers and would either
maintain or lower its payable to the Company each quarter. In addition, the Manufacturer agreed to rebate the Company any overage
of gross margin above 12% each month.

method which approximates the effective interest method. The amortization of debt discount is included as a component of other
expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. There was unamortized debt discount of $0 and $26,620 as of October

costs of $19,106, and the amendment fee of $170,500.  

In
August 2016, the note was further amended to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2017 as well as removed the convertible
feature of the note. The principal amount of the note was increased to $2,898,523, which shall be inclusive of accrued interest

The Company authorized 120,000 shares of Series A Preferred with each share of our Series A Preferred having a par value of $0.00001
and stated value equal to $100 ( Stated Value ), as adjusted for stock dividends, combinations, splits and certain

included in the conversion option, the Company concluded that equity treatment was warranted since the feature was clearly and
closely related to the host contract. The holders of the Series Preferred A will be entitled to (a) dividends at a rate of 8%
per annum, (b) a liquidation preference equal to $0.675 per Series A Preferred share, (c) the option to convert the Series A Preferred

Agreements
with Placement Agents and Finders   

(A)
April 1, 2015  

The
Company entered into a fourth Financial Advisory and Investment Banking Agreement with Spartan Capital Securities, LLC ( Spartan )
effective April 1, 2015 (the  Spartan Advisory Agreement ). Pursuant to the Spartan Advisory Agreement, the Company
shall pay to Spartan a non-refundable monthly fee of $10,000 through October 1, 2015. The monthly fee shall survive any termination
of the Agreement. Additionally, (i) if at least $4,000,000 is raised in the Financing, the Company shall pay to Spartan a non-refundable
fee of $5,000 per month from November 1, 2015 through October 2017; and (ii) if at least $5,000,000 is raised in the Financing,
the Company shall pay to Spartan a non-refundable fee of $5,000 per month from November 1, 2017 through October 2019. If $10,000,000
or more is raised in the Financing, the Company shall issue to Spartan shares of its common stock having an aggregate value of
$5,000 (as determined by reference to the average volume weighted average trading price for the last five trading days of the
immediately preceding month) on the first day of each month during the period from November 1, 2015 through October 1, 2019.  

The
Company upon closing of the Financing shall pay consideration to Spartan, in cash, a fee in an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate
gross proceeds raised in the Financing and 3% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Financing for expenses incurred by
Spartan. The Company shall grant and deliver to Spartan at the closing of the Financing, for nominal consideration, five year
warrants to purchase a number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 10% of the number of shares of common stock
(and/or shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of securities or upon conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable
securities) sold at such closing. The warrants shall be exercisable at any time during the five year period commencing on the
closing to which they relate at an exercise price equal to the purchase price per share of common stock paid by investors in the
Financing or, in the case of exercisable, convertible, or exchangeable securities, the exercise, conversion or exchange price
thereof. If the Financing is consummated by means of more than one closing, Spartan shall be entitled to the fees provided herein
with respect to each such closing.  

During
the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company paid to Spartan a one-time engagement fee of $10,000. In connection with the Initial
Closing, the Company agreed to pay an aggregate cash fee and non-accountable allowance of $157,300. The Company also granted warrants
to purchase 179,259 shares of common stock at $0.675 per share. The warrants have a grant date fair value of $84,547 which is
treated as a direct cost of the Financing and has been recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. During the nine
months ended October 31, 2016, no payments were made to Spartan.  

Operating
Lease   

In
January 2015, the Company began a lease agreement for office space in East Rutherford, NJ. The lease is for a 51 month term expiring
on March 31, 2019 with annual payments of $18,847.  

Total
future minimum payments required under operating lease as of October 31, 2016 are as follows:

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR PLAN OF OPERATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AND RELATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
THAT RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS OR OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES
AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT
FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD- LOOKING STATEMENTS.
THESE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THOSE LISTED UNDER  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  AND  RISK
FACTORS  DETAILED IN PRIOR COMPANY FILINGS AND THOSE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  

Plan
of Operation   

The Company plans to sell more of its products
into new and existing food retail outlets. At the same time, the Company is refining its customer base to concentrate on more
profitable accounts. Social media activity has increased with Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube. The Company
is utilizing various consumer merchandising activities including newsletter mailings, blogs, helpful consumer content, virtual
couponing, on-pack couponing, mail-in rebates, product demonstrations, co-op retail advertising to increase sales to existing
customers and new customers and special projects including a recipe bank of videos and MamaMancini s contest and giveaways. 

We
believe that the ongoing introduction of the Company s new all natural brand Slow Cooked Italian Sauce and various meatball
and entr e products show promise for additional product placements and sales in 2016 and thereafter. These products include
Eggplant Parmigiana, Stuffed Peppers, Baked Ziti and Meatballs, Five Cheese Stuffed Beef Meatballs, Chicken Parmigiana Style Stuffed
Meatballs, Chicken Florentine Stuffed Meatballs, Gluten Free Beef and Turkey Meatballs, Antibiotic Free Beef and Turkey Meatballs,
Cocktail Meat Balls, Original Beef and Original Turkey Meat Loaves, Beef Parmigiana and Turkey Parmigiana Meat Loaves, Beef and
Bacon Gorgonzola Meat Loaves, Grass-fed Beef Meatballs, Hearty Beef Sauce and Hearty Turkey Sauce. This line is available in bulk
food service pack, retail packages in fresh varieties, and club store pack in fresh varieties. Additionally, the Company plans
to continue expansion into various new retailers with placement of its existing product line of Beef, Turkey, Pork and Chicken
Meatballs and Sauce, as well as Marinara and Italian Sauce with beef flavors.  

The
Company has key sales personnel and a sales network of paid broker representatives. We currently work with approximately 35 retail
food brokers. In December 2015 we expanded our broker sales representative network, adding 8 within various territories and with
specific accounts of focus. We added additional food brokers in fiscal 2017 to increase our geographical coverage
in the United States from approximately 60% coverage in fiscal 2016 to approximately 90% as of October 31, 2016. Management
continues to solicit all major supermarket retailers, club stores and mass-market accounts. The Company is also soliciting business
in Canada and Mexico.  

The
Company currently has supply agreement with JEFE, a related party, which has been extended to August 2, 2021. This agreement automatically
renews for periods of one year unless otherwise terminated by nine months prior written notice. JEFE is owned by the CEO and President
of the Company.  

JEFE
increased its manufacturing capacity in 2015 and added 12,000 square feet of warehouse space in April 2016 to meet the anticipated
increased demand of the Company. Additions of high-speed equipment and new production order flow have occurred. The Company also
expects that its packaging costs will decrease as it purchases longer runs of material and supplies but cannot guarantee that
such packaging costs will decrease with the purchase of such materials or at all.  

We
believe that MamaMancini s products have the ability to expand sales and deliver more products within several areas of consumption
by consumers such as fresh meat, prepared foods, hot bars, cold bars in delis, and sandwich sections of supermarkets and other
food retailers. In addition, we believe that MamaMancini s products can be sold into food service channels, mass market,
and exported or as a component of other products.  

In
addition, since April 2015, the Company has streamlined it sales, and in the process has eliminated sales to about 20% of its
customers that had produced a negative profit contribution.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015   

The
following table sets forth the summary statements of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015:  

(1)  
      Slotting
    fees are required in new placements with some, but not a majority of supermarket chains that the Company does business with.
    They are negotiated with each chain depending upon the expected return to the Company. We believe that we have successfully
    negotiated such slotting fees to a relatively low expense. We have taken into account future fees currently being negotiated
    in preliminary negotiations for new placements. We do not believe our size or financial limitations are an impediment to being
    able to pay such slotting fees. Slotting fee costs are an expense in growing the business as are other marketing and sales
    costs and the Company has accounted for these fees in assessing its estimated working capital for the next 12 months.   

For
the quarters ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company reported net income of $80,603 and a net loss of $(975,622),
respectively. The change in net loss between the quarters ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, was primarily attributable
to an increase in sales.  

Sales:
 Sales, net of slotting fees and discounts increased by approximately 41% to $4,576,225 during the quarter ended October 31,
2016, from $3,237,780 during the quarter ended October 31, 2015. During the quarter ended October 31, 2016, the Company sold into
higher volume locations compared to the quarter ended October 31, 2015. The Company has sold into approximately 37,700 retail
and grocery locations at October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately 31,900 retail and grocery locations at October 31, 2015.
The reduction of sales locations was done to eliminate certain unprofitable retailers. These actions have contributed to an increased
profit margin percentage.  

Gross
Profit:  The gross profit margin was 36.8% for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 compared to 30.3% for the quarter ended October
31, 2015.  

Operating
Expenses:  Operating expenses increased by 7.5% during the quarter ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended
October 31, 2015. The $100,360 increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following approximate increases
in operating expenses:  

Stock-based
    compensation for services rendered by employees and consultants increased by of $60,400 compared to the same quarter of the
    prior year;   

Postage
    and freight of $70,500 due to higher sales offset by better efficiency,   

Commission
    expenses of $26,300 related to increased sales;   

Research
    and development costs increased by $4,700 due to the increase in overall costs for research and development during the year;   

Depreciation
    expense of $19,200 due to new fixed asset purchases during the period;   

Payroll
    and related expense of $6,800 as compensation to personnel; and   

Royalty
    expense of $11,500 related to increased sales.   

These
expense increases were offset by decreases in the following expenses:  

Advertising,
    social media and promotional expenses of $58,100 related to a decrease in spending on our radio advertising campaign and special
    promotions; and   

Professional
    fees decreased by $55,900 due to better management of this expense.   

Other
Expense:  Other expenses decreased by $454,403 to $162,960 for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $617,363 during
the quarter ended October 31, 2015. For the quarter ended October 31, 2016, other expenses consisted of $153,159 in interest expense
incurred on the Company s line of credit and term loan with EGC, the note payable with Manatuck, the promissory notes and
the related party notes payable. In addition, the Company recorded $9,801 of amortization expense related to the debt discount
and finance arrangements. For the quarter ended October 31, 2015, other expenses consisted of $145,252 in interest expense incurred
on the Company s line of credit and term loan with EGC and the convertible debenture with Manatuck. In addition, the Company
recorded $92,022 of amortization expense related to the debt discount and finance arrangements. During the three months ended
October 31, 2015, the Company also recorded $380,089 from a loss on debt extinguishment related to the amendment to the Manatuck
agreement in October 2015.  

Results
of Operations for the Nine Months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015   

The
following table sets forth the summary statements of operations for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015:  

(1)  
      Slotting
    fees are required in new placements with some, but not a majority of supermarket chains that the Company does business with.

    able to pay such slotting fees. Slotting fee costs are an expense in growing the business as are other marketing and sales
    costs and the Company has accounted for these fees in assessing its estimated working capital for the next 12 months.   

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $(422,314) and $(3,070,384), respectively.
The change in net loss between the periods ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, was primarily attributable to an increase
in sales and decreases in expenses detailed below.  

Sales:

31, 2016, from $9,330,259 during the nine months ended October 31, 2015. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
sold into higher volume locations compared to the Nine months ended October 31, 2015. The Company has sold into approximately
37,700 retail and grocery locations at October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately 31,900 retail and grocery locations at October

Operating
Expenses:  Operating expenses decreased by 2.5% during the nine months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the nine months
ended October 31, 2015. The $112,044 decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following approximate decreases
in operating expenses:  

Advertising,
    social media and promotional expenses of $716,900 related to a decrease in spending on our radio advertising campaign and
    special promotions; and   

Professional
    fees decreased by $148,900 due to better management of this expense.   

These
expense decreases were offset by increases in the following expenses:  

Stock-based
    compensation for services rendered by employees and consultants increased by of $236,800 compared to the same period of the
    prior year;   

Postage

Royalty
    expense of $21,800 related to increased sales.   

Other
Expense:  Other expenses decreased by $586,579 to $501,490 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $1,088,069

the nine months ended October 31, 2015, the Company also recorded $380,089 from a loss on debt extinguishment related to the amendment
to the Manatuck agreement in October 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at October 31, 2016 compared to January 31, 2016:  

As
of October 31, 2016, we had a working capital of $1,857,956 as compared to a working capital deficiency of $(34,365) as of January
31, 2016, an increase of $1,892,321. The increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in cash, accounts
receivable, prepaid expenses, inventories and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, promissory notes and related
party notes all of which were offset by decreases in due from manufacturer and increases in term loan and note payable. In addition,
the line of credit was amended in September 2016 and consequently reclassified to long-term on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets.  

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $146,619 and $889,314, respectively.
The net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $422,314 and $3,070,384, respectively.  

Net
cash used in all investing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 was $225,792 as compared to $204,024 for the
nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively, to acquire new machinery and equipment.  

Net
cash provided by all financing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 was $440,019 as compared to cash provided
by financing activities of $625,317 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016,
the Company had net borrowings of $490,859 and $340,000 for transactions pursuant to the line of credit and term loan, respectively.
These increases were offset by $91,667 and $241,829 paid for repayments on a term loan and net payments of promissory notes, respectively.
During the nine months ended October 31, 2015, the Company raised net proceeds of $560,000 from the issuance of preferred stock,
$650,000 from the issuance of demand notes and $125,000 from the proceeds of a note payable from related parties. This increase
was offset by $266,672 stock offering costs, $10,021 deferred offering costs, $11,191 debt issuance costs, $331,799 net repayments
of line of credit and $90,000 repayments of term loan, respectively.  

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss and net cash used in operations
of $422,314 and $146,619, respectively, for the nine months ended October 31, 2016.  

Our
auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue
its operations is dependent on Management s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets
with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided
by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain
related parties to sustain the Company s existence. In the event that we are unable to generate adequate revenues to cover
expenses and cannot obtain additional financing in the near future, we may seek protection under bankruptcy laws. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery
of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.  

The
Company may require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve
its strategic objectives. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company,
if at all. In that event, the Company would be required to change its growth strategy and seek funding on that basis, though there
is no guarantee it will be able to do so.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments
and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts
reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information
regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere
to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments
and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts
reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information
regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere
to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. While all these significant
accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies
determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management
to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that
given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.  

We
believe the following critical accounting policies and procedures, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  

Use
of Estimates - The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the following: allowance for
bad debt, inventory obsolescence, the fair value of share-based payments.  

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered
in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ significantly from our estimates.  

Stock-Based
Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,   Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation   established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It defines
a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718. The Company accounts for share based payments to non-employees in accordance
with ASC 505-50   Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services  .  

The
Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at
their fair value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.  

Share-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Share-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the
share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included
in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the services provided, in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

When
computing fair value of share-based payments, the Company has considered the following variables:  

The
    risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the
    option in effect at the time of the grant.   

The
    Company has not paid any dividends on common stock since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common
    stock in the foreseeable future.   

The
    expected option term is computed using the  simplified  method as permitted under the provisions of Staff Accounting
    Bulletin ( SAB ) 110.   

The
    warrant term is the life of the warrant.   

The
    expected volatility was benchmarked against similar companies in a similar industry.   

The
    forfeiture rate is based on the historical forfeiture rate for the Company s unvested stock options, which was 0%.   

Revenue
Recognition  -  The Company follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 104 for revenue recognition and records revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of
the related customer receivable is reasonably assured. There is no stated right of return for products. Sales are recognized upon
shipment of products to customers.  

Advertising
- Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising for the Company are charged to operations as incurred.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements:   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons,
also known as  special purpose entities  (SPEs).

We
do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Based
on evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(c) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in report that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.

results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our
