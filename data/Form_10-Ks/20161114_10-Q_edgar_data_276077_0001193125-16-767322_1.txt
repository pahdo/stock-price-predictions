    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016   
  (Unaudited)       

Note 1.  
  Accounting Policies       The financial statements herein include the financial statements of
Tidelands Royalty Trust  B  (the  Trust ) and Tidelands Royalty  B  Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary ( Tidelands Corporation,  and collectively with the Trust,  Tidelands ). The financial
statements are condensed and consolidated and should be read in conjunction with Tidelands  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements included herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of
Southwest Bank (the  Trustee ), the Trustee of the Trust, they include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods reported herein
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.      

Note 2.  
  Basis of Accounting       The financial statements of Tidelands are prepared on the modified
cash basis method and are not intended to present Tideland s financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). Under the modified cash basis
method the financial statements of Tidelands differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP because of the following:      

Royalty income is recognized in the month when received by Tidelands rather than in the month of production.        

Tidelands  expenses (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees  fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis in the month paid rather than in the month
incurred. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary, which would not be recorded under GAAP.    

At the time the Trust was established, no determinable market value was available for the assets transferred to the Trust; consequently, nominal values were assigned. Accordingly, no allowance for depletion has been
included. All income from oil and natural gas royalties relate to proved developed oil and natural gas reserves.      The
modified cash basis method of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial
Statements of Royalty Trusts .      

Note 3.  
  Distributable Income       The Trust s Indenture, as amended (the
 Indenture ), provides that the Trustee is to distribute all cash in the Trust, less an amount reserved for payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the last business day of March, June,
September and December of each year. Total estimated reserve for future expenses deducted from calculated distributable income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 26,500 and 54,500, respectively. Such payments are to be
made within 15 days after the record date.   As stated under  Note 1. Accounting Policies  above, the financial statements in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the condensed and consolidated financial statements of the Trust and Tidelands Corporation. However, distributable income is paid from the account balances of the Trust. Distributable income is
comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned directly by the Trust, (ii) 95% of the overriding royalties received by Tidelands Corporation from offshore Louisiana leases owned by Tidelands Corporation, which are retained by and
delivered to the Trust on a quarterly basis, and (iii) dividends paid to the Trust by Tidelands Corporation, less (iv) administrative expenses incurred by the Trust. Distributions fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to changes in
oil and natural gas prices and production quantities.

   Item 2.    Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations       Organization   
 Tidelands Royalty Trust  B  (the  Trust ) is a royalty trust that was created on June 1, 1954 under the laws of the State
of Texas. Southwest Bank, an independent state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, serves as corporate trustee (the  Trustee ). The Trust s Indenture (the
 Indenture ) provides that the term of the Trust will expire on April 30, 2021, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest. The Trust is not permitted to engage in any business
activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to interests in certain oil, natural gas or other mineral leases formerly owned by Gulf
Oil Corporation ( Gulf ) in a designated area of the Gulf of Mexico. These rights are evidenced by a contract between the Trust s predecessors and Gulf dated April 30, 1951 (the  1951 Contract ), which is binding upon
the assignees of Gulf. As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1951, the rights to interests that were subject to the 1951 Contract now are held by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. ( Chevron ), which is a subsidiary of
Chevron Corporation, and its assignees. The Trust holds title to interests in properties subject to the 1951 Contract that are situated offshore of Texas. 
 The Trust s wholly owned subsidiary, Tidelands Royalty  B  Corporation ( Tidelands Corporation,  and collectively
with the Trust,  Tidelands ), holds title to interests in properties subject to the 1951 Contract that are situated offshore of Louisiana because at the time the Trust was created, trusts could not hold these interests under Louisiana law.
Tidelands Corporation is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only takes those actions that are necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties.  
 Tidelands  rights are generally referred to as overriding royalty interests in the oil and natural gas industry. An overriding royalty
interest is created by an assignment by the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease. The royalty rights associated with an overriding royalty interest terminate when the underlying lease terminates. All production and marketing
functions are conducted by the working interest owners of the leases. Income from the overriding royalties is paid to Tidelands either (i) on the basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other minerals produced, saved or sold or (ii) at
the value at the wellhead as determined by industry standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead.    The
Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in
street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust ( WHFIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. The Trustee will provide the required information and the contact information for the Trustee is below: 
 Southwest Bank    2911 Turtle
Creek Blvd., Suite 850    Dallas, Texas 75219  
 Telephone number: (855) 588-7839  
 Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for compliance with U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     As
stated in the Indenture, there is no requirement for capital due to the limited purpose of the Trust. The Trust s only obligation is to distribute the distributable income that is actually collected to unitholders. As an administrator of
oil and natural gas royalty interests, the Trust collects royalties monthly, pays administrative expenses and disburses all net royalties that are collected to its unitholders each quarter, subject to the availability of distributable income on the
distribution determination date after the payment of expenses.   The Indenture (and Tidelands Corporation s charter and by-laws)
expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business. The Trust s oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets that are not being replaced due to the  
      5  

Table of Contents  

prohibition against investments. These restrictions, along with other factors, allow the Trust to be treated as a grantor trust. As a grantor trust, all income and deductions for state
and U.S. federal income tax purposes generally flow through to each individual unitholder. The State of Texas imposes a franchise tax, but the Trust does not believe that it is subject to the franchise tax because at least 90% of its income is
from passive sources. Please see Tidelands  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information. Tidelands Corporation is a taxable entity that pays U.S. federal income taxes and state
franchise taxes. However, Tidelands Corporation s income specifically excludes 95% of the oil and natural gas royalties collected by Tidelands Corporation, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust because of the Trust s net
profits interest.    The Leases     As of
November 1, 2016, Tidelands had an overriding royalty interest in four oil and natural gas leases covering 17,188 gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico in the Sabine Pass and West Cameron areas. As of November 1, 2016 all four of Tidelands 
assigned leases contained active wells. As of November 1, 2013, the wells on West Cameron Block 225 were shut-in and remain shut-in. As a royalty owner, Tidelands does not participate in operating decisions and has not received information from
the working interest owners, ENI Petroleum USA LLC or Mariner Energy Resources, Inc., regarding the shut-in status of the wells on West Cameron Block 225. Tidelands  overriding royalty interest on three of the four leases is 4.1662%. On
the fourth lease, the overriding royalty interest is 1.0416%. The overriding royalty interest on the fourth lease is lower because Chevron only acquired a 25% working interest in the lease. These leases and related overriding royalty
interests are identified in the table below:      
   Based on the latest public records reviewed by Tidelands, there are seven active oil or natural gas wells that
had production during the past 12 months on leases that are subject to Tidelands  overriding royalty interest based on the records of the Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management, Regulation and Enforcement, a division of the U.S.
government. The wells vary in age from approximately four years to fourteen years. Information on each of the seven wells is presented in the following table:      
   There number of active wells has not changed from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 In accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts , Tidelands uses the modified cash
basis method of accounting. Under this accounting method, royalty income is recorded when received and distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trustee of the Trust. Expenses of Tidelands (including accounting, legal,
other professional fees, trustees  fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis. Tidelands also reports distributable income instead of net income under the modified cash basis method of accounting. Cash
reserves are permitted to be established by the Trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  
 Tidelands did not have any changes in its critical accounting policies or estimates during the three months ended September 30,
2016. Please see Tidelands  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a detailed discussion of its critical accounting policies.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements     There are
no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on Tidelands  financial statements.     General   
 Tidelands  royalty income is derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of third parties. Tidelands  royalty income
fluctuates from period to period based upon factors beyond Tidelands  control, including, without limitation, the number of productive wells drilled and maintained on leases that are subject to Tidelands  interest, the level of production
over time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold.    Important aspects of Tidelands 
operations are conducted by third parties. Tidelands  royalty income is dependent on the operations of the working interest owners of the leases on which Tidelands has an overriding royalty interest. The oil and natural gas companies
that lease tracts subject to Tidelands  interests are responsible for the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Tidelands. The only obligation of the working interest owners to Tidelands is
to make monthly overriding royalty payments that reflect Tidelands  interest in the oil and natural gas sold. Tidelands  distributions are processed and paid by its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC. 
 The volume of oil and natural gas produced and the selling prices of oil and natural gas are the primary factors in calculating overriding
royalty payments. Production is affected by the natural production decline of the producing wells, the number of new wells drilled, and the number of existing wells that are re-worked and placed back in production on the leases. Production
from existing wells is anticipated to decrease in the future due to normal well depletion. The operators do not provide Tidelands with information regarding future drilling or re-working operations that could impact the oil and natural gas
production from the leases for which Tidelands has an overriding royalty interest.     Summary of Operating Results   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Tidelands realized approximately 72% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and
approximately 28% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Tidelands realized approximately 60% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 40% of its royalty
income from the sale of natural gas. Royalty income includes royalties from oil and natural gas received from producers.  
 Distributable income per unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $0.04 from $0.11 for the comparable period in
2015. Distributions per unit amounted to $0.06 for the nine months September 30, 2016, down from $0.19 for the comparable period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the difference between distributable income per unit
and distributions per unit resulted from timing differences between the closing of the financial statements and the determination date of the distributions to unitholders.

  The following table presents the net production quantities of oil and natural gas and
distributable income per unit and distributions per unit for the last six quarters.      
    Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015
    Income from oil and natural gas royalties decreased to $51,876 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $115,617
realized for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the production and price of natural gas and oil.  
 Distributable income decreased to $30,978 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to distributable income of $89,719 for
the comparable period in 2015. Although there was distributable income remaining after the payment of expenses, due to the timing of the revenue receipts establishment of reserve for future expenses, and the payment of expenses, the distributable
income was not sufficient to have funds available on the distribution date for distribution on October 14, 2016 to the unitholders of record as of September 30, 2016. There were also no funds available on the distribution date for distribution on
July 14, 2016 to the unitholders of record as of June 30, 2016.    Income from oil royalties decreased to $37,464 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $74,587 realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price and production of oil. The volume of oil sold in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 913 bbls from 1,327 bbls
realized for the comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for oil decreased to $41.02 per bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $56.24 per bbl realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Income from natural gas royalties decreased to $14,412 (net of expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $41,030
realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price and production of natural gas. The volume of natural gas sold in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 7,877 mcf from 13,827 mcf realized for the
comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for natural gas decreased to $1.83 per mcf from $2.97 per mcf realized for the comparable period in 2015.

  The following table presents the quantities of oil and natural gas sold and the average price
realized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
   General and administrative expenses decreased to $20,656 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$25,900 for the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the timing of payments of, and a reduction in, professional fees and expenses paid in the quarter.  
  Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Income from oil and natural gas royalties decreased to $169,815 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $282,162 realized for
the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the price of oil and natural gas and a decrease in the production of natural gas, offset by an increase in the production of oil.  
 Distributable income decreased to $55,564 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $158,263 for the comparable period in 2015.
   Income from oil royalties decreased to $123,838 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $169,963 realized for the comparable
period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price of oil offset in part by an increase in the production of oil. The volume of oil sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 3,331 bbls from 2,940 bbls realized for the
comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for oil decreased to $37.17 per bbl for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $57.82 per bbl realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Income from natural gas royalties decreased to $45,977 (net of expenses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $112,199
realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price and production of natural gas. The volume of natural gas sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 26,226 mcf from 35,037 mcf realized for the
comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for natural gas decreased to $1.75 per mcf from $3.20 per mcf realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 The following table presents the quantities of oil and natural gas sold and the average price realized for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.      
   General and administrative expenses decreased to $111,020 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
$123,911 for the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the timing of payments of, and a reduction in, professional fees and expenses paid in the quarter.

   Forward-Looking Statements   
 The statements discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding Tidelands  future financial performance and results, and other
statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ). This report uses the words  anticipate,   believe,   budget,   continue,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,  or other
similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of Tidelands  financial condition, and/or state other
 forward-looking  information. Actual results may differ from expected results because of: reductions in prices or demand for oil and natural gas, which might then lead to decreased production or impair Tidelands  ability to
make distributions; reductions in production due to the depletion of existing wells or disruptions in service, which may be caused by storm damage to production facilities, blowouts or other production accidents, or geological changes such as
cratering of productive formations; changes in regulations; general economic conditions; actions and policies of petroleum producing nations; other changes in domestic and international energy markets; the resignation of the Trustee; and the
expiration, termination or release of leases subject to Tidelands  interests. Additional risks are set forth in Tidelands  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the risks set forth in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Events may occur in the future that Tidelands is unable to accurately predict, or over which it has no control. If one or more of these uncertainties materialize, or if
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Tidelands does not undertake any
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.     Website   
 Tidelands makes available, free of charge, Tidelands  Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form
8-K, and amendments to such reports at its website at  www.tirtz-tidelands.com . Each of these reports will be posted on this website as soon as reasonably practicable after such report is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  
  Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
 Tidelands did not experience any material changes in market risk during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.  Tidelands  market risk is described in more detail in  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in Tidelands  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.     Item 4.    Controls and Procedures    
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Southwest Bank, as Trustee of the Trust, is responsible for establishing and maintaining Tidelands  disclosure controls and procedures.
Tidelands  disclosure controls and procedures include controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Tidelands in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Tidelands in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Tidelands  disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Trustee concluded that Tidelands  disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 There have not been any changes in Tidelands  internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that
