 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANICAL STATEMENTS
  (UNAUDITED) 

 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

1. 
      Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016. For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Going Concern  

 The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might
result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated significant revenue, and has negative
cash flows from operations, which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among
other things, additional cash infusion. The Company has historically obtained funds through private placements offerings of equity
and debt. Management believes that it will be able to continue to raise funds by sale of its securities to its existing shareholders
and prospective new investors to provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company s obligations as they become due,
and will allow the development of its core of business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue raising
the required capital for its operations. 

2. 
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

This summary of significant accounting
policies of the Company are presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The financial statements
and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These
accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently
applied in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition  

 The Company will recognize revenue when
services are performed, and at the time of shipment of products, provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk
of loss have passed to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
To date, the Company has not had significant revenues and is in the development stage. 

Cash and Cash Equivalent   

 The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements,
include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance, derivative liabilities and
the fair value of stock options. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Intangible Assets  

 Intangible assets consist of patents that
are initially measured at the lower of cost or fair value.  The patents are deemed to have an indefinite life and are
not amortized. The patents are assessed annually for impairment, or whenever conditions indicate the asset may be impaired, and
any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

 The Company measures the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an equity award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. All grants under our stock-based
compensation programs are accounted for at fair value and that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee, consultant,
or director are required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). Compensation expense for options granted
to employees and non-employees is determined in accordance with the standard as the fair value of the consideration received or
the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. Compensation expense for awards granted is
re-measured each period. 

Determining the appropriate fair value of
the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based payment
and stock price volatility.  The Company uses the Binomial option-pricing model to value its stock option awards which incorporate
the Company s stock price, volatility, U.S. risk-free rate, dividend rate, and estimated life. On March 24, 2015, the Company
granted 2,450,000 stock options with an exercise price of $0.09 per share, and on September 2, 2015 the Company granted an additional
13,500,000 stock options with an exercise price of $0.26 per share. The options will vest 1/25 on a monthly basis starting April
24, 2015 and October 1, 2015, respectively, and terminate seven (7) years from the date of grant or upon termination of employment. 

2.  
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

Income (Loss) per Share Calculations  

 Loss per Share dictates the calculation
of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share
except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company s diluted loss
per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as the inclusion of any potential
shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss. The Company has excluded 15,975,000 options,
245,000 warrants, and the shares issuable from convertible debt of $1,852,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires
disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that
value. As of September 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses,
approximate the fair value because of their short maturities. 

Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active
markets;  
 
      Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly
or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and  
 
      Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring
an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant
inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.   

We measure certain financial instruments
at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September
30, 2016: 

The following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability
for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining the approximate fair value: 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

 Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed
financial statements. 

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related
footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity
in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an Entity s ability to continue
as a going concern by 

2.  
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
(Continued) 

 incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating
effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and
(6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be
issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15,
2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s
financial statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards
update ASU-2016-09,  Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting . The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations
that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments award transactions
are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification
on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual
period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-9 on the Company s financial statements. 

In March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards
update ASU-2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments .
The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that
are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. U.S. GAAP provides specific guidance for assessing whether
call (put) options that can accelerate the repayment of principal on a debt instrument meet the clearly and closely related criterion.
The guidance states that for contingent call (put) options to be considered clearly and closely related, they can be indexed only
to interest rates or credit risk. Public companies must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluation the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-06
on the Company s financial statements. 

In August 2016, FASB issued accounting standards
update ASU-2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption
in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on the Company s financial
statements.

at September 30, 2016 was $348,000. Each advance matures twelve (12) months from the effective date of each advance. The note is
convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to a variable conversion price of a) the lesser of $0.13
per share of common stock, b) fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trade price recorded since the original effective date of the note,
or c) the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity after the effective date to acquire common stock. The
fair value of the note has been determined by using the Binomial lattice formula with an expected life of twelve (12) months. The
Company recorded amortization of debt discount, which was recognized as interest expense in the amount of $60,214 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.  

RELATED PARTY CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTES  

On December 18, 2014, the Company issued two 5% convertible promissory notes in exchange for services
rendered by the Company s Chief Executive Officer ($67,000) and Chief Technology Officer ($61,000) in the aggregate amount
of $128,000. The notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to the lesser of
$0.101 per share of common stock or the closing price per share of common stock recorded on the trading day immediately preceding
the date of conversion. The notes mature two (2) years from their effective dates. The fair value of the notes has been determined
by using the Binomial lattice formula with an expected life of two (2) years. The Company recorded amortization of debt discount,
which was recognized as interest expense in the amount of $35,980 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

5.    
     CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES (Continued)  

We evaluated the financing transactions
in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory
note was not afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments due to its variable conversion rate. The note has
no explicit limit on the number of shares issuable so they did not meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards
for equity classification. The Company elected to recognize the note under paragraph 815-15-25-4, whereby, there would be a separation
into a host contract and derivative instrument. The Company elected to initially and subsequently measure the note in its entirety
at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company recorded a derivative liability representing the
imputed interest associated with the embedded derivative. The derivative liability is adjusted periodically according to the stock
price fluctuations. 

6.  
     DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

The convertible notes
issued and described in Note 5 do not have fixed settlement provisions because their conversion prices are not fixed. The conversion
feature has been characterized as derivative liabilities to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change
in value reported in the statement of operations. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as a result of the convertible notes ( Notes ) issued that were accounted for as derivative liabilities,
we determined that the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible notes at issuance was $288,274, based upon a Binomial-Model
calculation. We recorded the full value of the derivative as a liability at issuance with an offset to valuation discount, which
will be amortized over the life of the Notes. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, approximately $134,800 convertible notes were converted. As a result of the conversion of these notes and the change
in fair value of the remaining notes, the Company recorded a loss on net change in derivative and conversion of debt in the amount
of $179,194 in the statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the fair value
of the derivative liability was $8,346,067. 

For purpose of determining the fair market
value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion, the Company used the Binomial lattice valuation model. The
significant assumptions used in the Binomial lattice valuation model for the derivative are as follows: 

7.  
     COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we have a new material commitment for capital expenditures in the form of a sponsored research agreement
with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University during the next twelve months. The contract period is from September
12, 2016 through September 11, 2017 and the total cost shall not exceed the sum of $123,993. The commitment shall be financed by
the issuance of equity or debt securities. 

8.  
     SUBSEQUENT EVENT  

Management has evaluated subsequent events according to the requirements of ASC TOPIC 855 and has
determined that there are the following subsequent events:   

On October 11, 2016, the Company received a $50,000 advance on a securities purchase agreement
entered into on April 8, 2016. The securities purchase agreement provides for the issuance of a 10 % unsecured convertible note
in the aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price
equal to a variable conversion price of a) the lesser of $0.13 per share of common stock, b) fifty percent (50%) of the lowest
trade price recorded on any trade day after the effective date or c) the lowest effective price per share granted to any person
or entity after the effective date to acquire common stock.   

Effective October 1, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note, which had an initial
maturity date of October 1, 2016. On October 13, 2016, the Company and the borrower agreed to amend the convertible promissory
note to extend the maturity date to sixty (60) months from the effective date of the note.   

On October 26, 2016, the Company issued
988,198 shares of common stock upon conversion of the convertible promissory note in the amount of principal of $6,700, plus accrued
interest of $1667. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements.  

Certain statements
in  Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation  below, and elsewhere in this quarterly report,
are not related to historical results, and are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements present our expectations
or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements frequently are accompanied
by such words such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   expects, 
 plans,   intends,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts, 
 potential  or  continue,  or the negative of such terms or other words and terms of similar meaning. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance, achievements, or timeliness of such results. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements. We are under no duty to update any of the
forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report. Subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting in our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements and risk factors
set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016, and in other reports filed by us with the SEC. 

You should read the
following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying
notes included in this report. 

Overview  

We are developing
innovative technologies to reduce the cost per watt of electricity produced by Photovoltaic solar modules. The process for
producing electricity from sunlight is known as Photovoltaics. Photovoltaics ( PV ) is the science of capturing
and converting sun light into electricity. 

We are currently
focusing on developing a low cost energy storage solution based on our polymer-based battery electrode material technology that
we believe will result in higher energy capacity, lower cost per watt, and substantially longer life of energy storage devices.
Lower cost of energy storage will results in reduced cost per watt of electricity produced by PV solar modules. 

We were incorporated
in the State of Nevada on April 24, 2006, as BioSolar Labs, Inc. Our name was changed to BioSolar, Inc. on June 8, 2006. Our principal
executive offices are located at 27936 Lost Canyon Road, Suite 202, Santa Clarita, California 91387, and our telephone number is
(661) 251-0001. Our fiscal year end is December 31. 

Recent Transactions  

None. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value computation using a Binomial
lattice valuation model. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, such as the trading value
of our common stock and estimated future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe
that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable. 

Use of Estimates  

In accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
These estimates and assumptions relate to recording net revenue, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives and impairment
of tangible and intangible assets, accruals, income taxes, inventory realization, stock-based compensation expense and other factors.
Management believes it has exercised reasonable judgment in deriving these estimates. Consequently, a change in conditions could
affect these estimates. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Our cash, cash
equivalents, investments, inventory, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable are stated at cost which approximates fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Management reviewed
currently issued pronouncements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and does not believe that any other recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial
statements. The pronouncements adopted during the period are disclosed in the notes of the financials. 

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

OPERATING EXPENSES  

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative
( G A ) expenses increased by $403,696 to $534,526 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$130,830 for the prior period ended September 30, 2015. This increase in G A expenses was the result of an increase in non-cash
stock compensation expense of $370,656, an increase in investor relations of $21,586, and an increase in professional fees of
$15,850, with an overall decrease of $4,395 in other G A expenses. 

Research and Development   

Research and Development
( R D ) expenses decreased by $19,835 to $55,646 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $75,481
for the prior period ended September 30, 2015. This overall decrease in R D expenses was the result of a decrease in materials
  supplies and contracting of outside services. 

Other Income/(Expenses)   

Other income and
(expenses) decreased by $8,195,925 to $(658,544) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7,537,380 for the
prior period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other income and (expenses) was the result of a decrease in non-cash gain
on change in fair value of the derivative instruments of $8,195,379 with a decrease in interest expense in the amount of $9,313,
which includes non-cash expense of amortization of debt discount in the amount of $24,897, a decrease in loss on sale of asset
of $9,862, and an increase in interest income of $3. The decrease in other income and (expenses) was primarily due to the net
change in the fair value of the derivative instruments. 

Net Income (Loss)   

Our net loss for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $(1,249,389), compared to net income of $7,328,964 for the prior period ended September
30, 2015. The increase in net loss was due to a decrease in non-cash other income (expenses) associated with the net change in
derivative instruments, and an overall increase in operating expenses primarily associated with non-cash stock compensation.  The
Company has not generated any revenues. 

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

OPERATING EXPENSES  

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative
( G A ) expenses increased by $1,211,231 to $1,596,708 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$385,477 for the prior period ended September 30, 2015. This increase in G A expenses was the result of an increase in non-cash
stock compensation expense of $1,125,473, an increase in investor relations of $43,839, an increase in professional fees of $36,524,
an increase in insurance of $14,597, with an overall decrease of $9,202 in other G A expenses. 

Research and Development   

Research and Development
( R D ) expenses increased by $52,282 to $198,539 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $146,257
for the prior period ended September 30, 2015. This overall increase in R D expenses was the result of developing technologies
and materials for storing electrical energy produced by photovoltaic solar modules. 

Other Income/(Expenses)   

Other income and
(expenses) decreased by $9,340,338 to $(650,012) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $(9,990,350) for the
prior period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was the result of a decrease in non-cash gain on change in fair value of the
derivative instruments of $9,467,245, with an increase in interest expense in the amount of $117,059, which includes non-cash expense
of amortization of debt discount in the amount of $71,733, a decrease in loss on sale of asset of $9,862, and an increase in interest
income of $14. The decrease in other income and (expenses) was primarily due to the net change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments. 

Net Income (Loss)   

Our net loss for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(2,447,463), compared to $(10,528,388) for the prior period ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease in net loss was due to a decrease in non-cash other income (expenses) associated with the net change in derivative
instruments, and an overall increase in operating expenses primarily associated with non-cash stock compensation.  The
Company has not generated any revenues. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Liquidity is the
ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. 

The condensed financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed financial statements do
not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we did not generate any revenues, incurred a net loss of $2,447,463, and cash used in operations of $558,850. As of September
30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency of $9,024,237 and a shareholders  deficit of $9,833,588. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors, in their report on
our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern and suitability of using the going concern basis is dependent upon,
among other things, additional cash infusion. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we obtained funding through the sale
of our securities. Management believes that we will be able to continue to raise funds through the sale of our securities to existing
and new investors. Management believes that funding from existing and prospective new investors and future revenue will provide
the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of our core business operations. 

As of September 30,
2016, we had a working capital deficit of $9,024,237 compared to capital deficit of $8,807,278 for the year ended December 31,
2015. This increase in capital deficit of $216,959 was due primarily to an increase in cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
the issuance of convertible promissory notes, and the derivative liability associated with the notes, with a decrease in prepaid
expenses. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we used $558,850 of cash for operating activities, as compared to $500,737 for the prior
period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities was a result of a  decrease in net
loss, which included an increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Cash (used)/provided
by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $(1,984) and $13,277, respectively. The overall
net change in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of small office equipment and patent expenditures in the
prior period. 

Cash provided from
financing activities was $603,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $500,000 for the prior period ended
September 30, 2015. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions and
future revenue. Our capital needs have primarily been met from the proceeds of private placements, as we currently have not generated
any revenues. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we had a material commitment for capital expenditures in the form of a sponsored research agreement
with the University of California Santa Barbara.  We have a new material commitment for capital expenditures in the
form of a sponsored research agreement with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University during the next twelve
months. Although proceeds from our financing activities are currently sufficient to fund our operating expenses through the next
four months, we will need to raise additional funds in the future so that we can expand our operations. Therefore,
our future operations are dependent on our ability to secure additional financing.  Financing transactions may
include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading
price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing
through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could
incur unexpected costs and expenses, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek additional financing.
Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to
obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease
our operations. 

We believe that we
have assets to ensure that we can continue to operate without liquidation over the next four months, due to our cash on hand, and
our ability in the past to raise money from our investor base.  Based on the aforesaid, we believe we have the ability
to continue our operations for the next twelve months and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal
course of our operations. 

Our financial statements
as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered
public accounting firm has issued their report dated March 4, 2016 that included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial
doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a
going concern ultimately is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue, which is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional
equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. Our financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FINANCING NEEDS  

We are engaged in
the development of innovative technologies that will reduce the cost per watt of electricity generated by Photovoltaic solar modules.  We
have developed BioBacksheet R  , our first commercial product, and we are currently focusing on developing a low
cost energy storage technology and materials for batteries by 2018. 

Our plan of operation
within the next six months is to utilize our cash balances to develop our silicon-based anode technology for high capacity, high
density, and low cost Lithium-ion batteries.  We believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient
to support development activity and general and administrative expenses for the next five months. Management estimates that it
will require additional cash resources during 2016, based upon its current operating plan and condition. We expect increased expenses
during the second half of 2016 as we ramp up prototyping efforts for Lithium-ion batteries incorporating our electrode material. 
We will be investigating additional financing alternatives, including equity and/or debt financing. There is no assurance that
capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable. If we are unable to
obtain sufficient funds during the next fifteen months, we may be forced to reduce the size of our organization, which could have
a material adverse impact on, or cause us to curtail and/or cease the development of our products 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, result of operations, liquidity
or capital expenditures. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

As a smaller reporting company, as that
term is defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of
the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There was no change
to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our second fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are not a party
to any pending legal proceeding, nor is our property the subject of a pending legal proceeding, that is not in the ordinary course
of business or otherwise material to the financial condition of our business. None of our directors, officers or affiliates is
involved in a proceeding adverse to our business or has a material interest adverse to our business. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

There are no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Registrant s Form 10-K filed on March 4, 2016.
