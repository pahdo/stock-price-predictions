NOTES TO   THE   CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

Note 1   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities   and Exchange Commission   and do not include all of the disclosures normally required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) as contained in Lindsay Corporation s (the  Company ) Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 201  6  . 

In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of trends or results expected by the Company for a full year.  The condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using U.S. GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates.    Certain reclassifications have been made to prior financial statements and notes to conform to the current year presentation.  

Note 2   New Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date.   The standard provides a single model for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. The ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP and becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted only in fiscal 2018. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method, nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   The standard requires an entity to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. In addition, companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent because all deferred tax assets will be classified as noncurrent.  The guidance allows companies to apply the update either on a retrospective or prospective basis. The Company has early adopted this ASU during the first quarter of fiscal     2017 on a retrospective basis.  Accordingly, the Company reclassified current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current on its November 30, 2015 and August 31, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheets, which increased net non-current deferred tax assets by   $2.0   million and   $3.3   million, respectively, and decreased non-current deferred tax liabilities by   $10.3   million and   $12.0   million, respectively. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities arising from an operating lease on the balance sheet. Additionally, companies are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less.  The effective date of ASU No. 2016-02 will be the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    The standard provides guidance for employee share-based compensation payments, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification on the statement of cash flows.  The Company elected to early adopt this ASU as of the beginning of fiscal 2017.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recognized all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the quarter. An income tax benefit of approximately   $0.1   million was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Additionally, as required by the new guidance, when calculating diluted earnings per share, excess tax benefits were excluded from the calculation of assumed proceeds since such amounts are recognized in the income statement.  ASU 2016-09 also allows an entity to elect, as an accounting policy, either to estimate the number of forfeited awards or to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.  This change did not have a material impact on estimated

expense.  The Company elected to present the cash flow statement on a retrospective transition method and prior periods have been adjusted to present the excess tax benefits as part of cash flows from operating activities. This resulted in an increase in cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in cash flows from financing activities of   $0.1   million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 

Note 3   Net Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding common shares.  Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards and other dilutive securities.   

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015: 

Certain stock options and restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  Performance stock units are excluded from the calculation of dilutive potential common shares until the threshold performance conditions have been satisfied.  In addition, the following table shows the securities excluded from the computation of earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive: 

Note 4   Income Taxes 

It is the Company s policy to report income tax expense for interim periods using an estimated annual effective income tax rate. However, the tax effects of significant or unusual items are not considered in the estimated annual effective income tax rate. The tax effects of such discrete events are recognized in the interim period in which the events occur. The Company recorded   no   material discrete items for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015. 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million and $3.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively. The estimated annual effective income tax rate was   34.6   percent and   33.2   percent for the fiscal year-to-date periods ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in the estimated annual effective income tax rate from November 2015 to November 2016 primarily   relates to the earnings mix among jurisdictions.

Note 7   Financial Derivatives 

The Company uses certain financial derivatives to mitigate its exposure to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company uses these derivative instruments to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  The Company manages market and credit risks associated with its derivative instruments by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken, and by entering into transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.  Fair values of derivative instruments are as follows: 

Accumulated other comprehensive income included realized and unrealized after-tax gains of   $6.5   million,   $6.7   million, and   $5.6   million at November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015, and August 31, 2016, respectively, related to derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments. 

Net Investment Hedging Relationships 

The amount of gain or (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income is as follows: 

For the three months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015, the Company settled foreign currency forward contracts resulting in an after-tax net loss of   $0.1   million each quarter, which were included in other comprehensive income as part of a currency translation adjustment.  There were   no   amounts recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations related to ineffectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts related to net investment hedges for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015.  

At November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015 and August 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding Euro foreign currency forward contracts to sell   32.6   million Euro,   28.8   million Euro, and   32.6   million Euro, respectively, at fixed prices to settle during the next fiscal quarter. At November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015, and August 31, 2016, the Company had an outstanding South African Rand foreign currency forward contract to sell   43.0   million South African Rand at fixed prices to settle during the next fiscal quarter.  The Company s foreign currency forward contracts qualify as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations.  

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 

The Company generally does not elect hedge accounting treatment for derivative contracts related to future settlements of foreign denominated intercompany receivables and payables.  If the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment for a derivative, the Company carries the derivative at its fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and recognizes any subsequent changes in its fair value during a period through earnings in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.  At November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015, and August 31, 2016, the Company had   $6.9   million, $  9.6   million, and $  8.2   million, respectively, of U.S. dollar equivalent of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding that are not designated as hedging instruments.

Note 8   Fair Value Measurements 

The following table presents the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015, and August 31, 2016, respectively. There were no transfers between any levels for the periods presented. 

There were no required fair value adjustments for   assets   and   liabilities   measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended November 30, 2016 or November 30, 2015. 

Note 9   Commitments and Contingencies 

In the ordinary course of its business operations, the Company enters into arrangements that obligate it to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements.  Additionally, the Company is involved, from time to time, in commercial litigation, employment disputes, administrative proceedings, business disputes and other legal proceedings.  The Company has established accruals for certain proceedings based on an assessment of probability of loss.  The Company believes that any potential loss in excess of the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on the business or its consolidated financial statements.  Such proceedings are exclusive of environmental remediation matters which are discussed separately below.  

Environmental Remediation 

In 1992, the Company entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) in which the Company committed to remediate environmental contamination of the groundwater that was discovered from 1982 through 1990 at and adjacent to its Lindsay, Nebraska facility (the  site ).  The site was added to the EPA s list of priority superfund sites in 1989.  Between 1993 and 1995, remediation plans for the site were approved by the EPA and fully implemented by the Company.  Since 1998, the primary remaining contamination at the site has been the presence of volatile organic compounds in the soil and groundwater.  To date, the remediation process has consisted primarily of drilling wells into the aquifer and pumping water to the surface to allow these contaminants to be removed by aeration.  

In fiscal 2012, the Company undertook an investigation to assess further potential site remediation and containment actions.  In connection with the receipt of preliminary results of this investigation and other evaluations, the Company estimated that it would incur   $7.2   million in remediation of source area contamination and operating costs and accrued that undiscounted amount.  In addition to this source area, the Company determined that volatile organic compounds also existed under one of the manufacturing buildings on the site.  Due to the location, the Company had not yet determined the extent of these compounds or the extent to which they were contributing to groundwater contamination.  Based on the uncertainty of the remediation actions that might be required with respect to this affected area, the Company believed that meaningful estimates of costs or range of costs could not be made and accordingly were not accrued at that time. 

In December 2014, the EPA requested that the Company prepare a feasibility study related to the site, including the area covered by the building, which resulted in a revision to the Company s remediation timeline.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company accrued   $1.5   million of incremental operating costs to reflect its updated timeline.   

-      11      - 

Table of Contents  

The Company began soil and groundwater testing in preparation for developing this feasibility study during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company completed its testing which clarified the extent of contamination, including the identification of a source of contamination near the manufacturing building that was not part of the area for which reserves were previously established.  The Company, with the assistance of third-party environmental experts, developed and evaluated remediation alternatives, a proposed remediation plan, and estimated costs.  Based on these estimates of future remediation and operating costs, the Company accrued an additional   $13.0   million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and included the related expenses in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.    

The current estimated aggregate accrued cost of   $18.8   million is based on consideration of several remediation options that would use different technologies, each of which the Company believes could be successful in meeting the long-term regulatory requirements of the site. The Company participated in a preliminary meeting with the EPA and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (the  NDEQ ) during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to review remediation alternatives and proposed plans for the site and submitted its remedial alternatives evaluation report to the EPA in August 2016.  The proposed remediation plan is preliminary and has not been approved by the EPA or the NDEQ.  Based on guidance from third-party environmental experts and further discussions with the EPA and the NDEQ, the Company anticipates that a definitive plan will not be agreed upon until later in fiscal 2017 or beyond. 

The Company accrues the anticipated cost of investigation and remediation when the obligation is probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the Company believes the current accrual is a good faith estimate of the long-term cost of remediation at this site based on the preliminary analysis currently available, the estimate of costs and their timing could change as a result of a number of factors, including (1) EPA and NDEQ input on the proposed remediation plan and any changes which they may subsequently require, (2) refinement of cost estimates and length of time required to complete remediation and post-remediation operations and maintenance, (3) effectiveness of the technology chosen in remediation of the site as well as changes in technology that may become available in the future, and (4) unforeseen circumstances existing at the site. As a result of these factors, the actual amount of costs incurred by the Company in connection with the remediation of contamination of its Lindsay, Nebraska site could exceed the amounts currently accrued for this expense.  While any revisions could be material to the operating results of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year, the Company does not expect such additional expenses would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or financial condition. 

The following table summarizes the undiscounted environmental remediation liability classifications included in the balance sheet as of November 30, 2016, November 30, 2015, and August 31, 2016:

recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. Share-based compensation expense was $  0.9   million for each of the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The following table illustrates the type and fair value of the share-based compensation awards granted during the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The RSUs granted during the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of   3,634   and   3,496  , respectively of awards that will be settled in cash. The weighted average stock price on the date of the grant was   $78.23   and   $67.68   for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the stock options awarded during the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015:

ITE    M 2       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Concerning Forward   Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains not only historical information, but also forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933  , as amended,   and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Statements that are not historical are forward-looking and reflect information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and planned financing of the Company.  In addition, forward-looking statements may be made orally or in press releases, conferences, rep  orts, on the Company's   web site, or otherwise, in the future by or on behalf of the Company.  When used by or on behalf of the Company, the words "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend," "will," "plan,"  predict,  "project," "outlook," "could," "may," "should" or similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements.  The entire section entitled  Executive Overview and Outlook  should be considered forward-looking statements.  For these statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those discussed in the  Risk Factors  section in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 201  6  .  Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that the statements are predictions of future results or conditions, which may not occur as anticipated.  Actual results or conditions could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described herein and in the Company s other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company s fiscal year ended   August 31, 2016  , as well as other risks and uncertainties not now anticipated.  The risks and uncertainties described herein and in the Company s other public filings are not exclusive and further information concerning the Company and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect the Company's financial results, may emerge from time to time.  Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements.  

Accounting Policies 

In preparing the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures.  These decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates.  In making these decisions, management applies its judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and the Company s historical experience.   

The Company s accounting policies that are most important to the presentation of its results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management, are designated as its critical accounting policies.  See discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies under Item 7 in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company s fiscal year ended   August 31, 2016  .  Management periodically re-evaluates and adjusts its critical accounting policies as circumstances change.  There were no changes in the Company s critical accountin  g policies during the three   months ended   November 30, 2016  .

Net earnings for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   were   $0.9   million,   or   $0.08   per diluted share  ,   compared with net earnings of   $6.9   million,   or   $0.62   per diluted share  ,   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .  Operating margin for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   was   2.5   percent  ,   compared to   9.7   percent for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .  The decrease in earnings and operating margin was primarily attributable to lower revenues, which declined   9   percent to   $110.4   million   from   $121.6   million  ,   reduced gross margin,   and higher operating expenses of   $3.0   million  . 

The reducti  on in revenue is mainly attributable to   the i  rrigation segment, where sales decreased   11   percent to   $89.9   million. The decline in irrigation revenues was slightly offset by an increase in revenue from the i  nfrastructure segment, in which sales   in  creased   one   percent to   $20.5   million  .  In the irrigation segment, the decrease in revenue   is   primarily due to a reduction in irrigation system unit volume as falling commodity prices and reduced farm income negatively impacted demand for irrigation equipment.  The increase in infrastructure revenues results from higher sales volume in road safety products offset, in part, by lower   Road Zipper  system project sales and lease revenue.

The Company s irrigation revenues are highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural crop production, which, in turn, depends upon many factors, including the following primary drivers: 

Agricultural commodity prices   -   As of November 2016, c  orn prices have decreased approximately 10 percent while soybean prices have increased approximately 17 percent from November 2015.  Although there has been an increase in soybean prices from the previous year, both   corn and soybean prices remain substantially lower than the peak prices observed during the last five years.  Among other things, favorable growing conditions in the United States throughout the 2016 growing season have led to record harvests which, combined with the current high stock of commodities, may continue to contribute to low prices for agricultural commodities.        

Weather conditions     Demand for irrigation equipment is often positively affected by   storm damage   and prolonged periods of drought conditions as producers look for ways to reduce the risk of low crop production and crop failures.  Conversely, demand for irrigation equipment can be negatively affected during periods of more predictable natural precipitation  , such as the conditions experienced during 2016  .        

Governmental policies   - A number of governmental laws and regulations can affect the Company s business, including:     

The Agricultural Act of 2014 provides a degree of certainty to growers by adopting a five-year farm bill. This law continued many of the existing programs, including funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program   (EQIP)  , which provides financial assistance to farmers to implement conservation practices, and is frequently used to assist in the purchase of center pivot irrigation systems.      

Current   tax incentives  ,   such as the Section 179 income tax de  duction and bonus depreciation,   are intended to encourage equipment purchases  .     These incentives could benefit equipment sales in the future.       

Various U.S. and global trade sanctions, as well as market fluctuations and political hostility, could negatively affect irrigation equipment sales to certain geographic markets around the world.      

Biofuel production continues to be a major demand driver for irrigated corn, sugar cane and soybeans as these crops are used in high volumes to produce ethanol and biodiesel.  Annual biofuel production targets established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in November 2016 project a six percent increase in ethanol production and a five percent increase in biodiesel production from 2016 to 2017.     

Many international markets are affected by government policies such as subsidies and other agriculturally related incentives.  While these policies can have a significant effect on individual markets, they typically do not have a material effect on the consolidated results of the Company.      

Currency     The value of the U.S. dollar has been rising in relation to the value of currencies in a number of countries to which the Company exports products   and in which the Company maintains local operations. The strengthening of the dollar increases the cost in the local currency of the products exported from the U.S. into these countries and, therefore, could negatively affect the Company s international sales and margins. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of sales made in any affected foreign currencies will decline as the value of the dollar rises in relation to these other currencies.     

As the Company continues to manage through a prolonged downturn in the agricultural cycle, there has not been a sufficient catalyst t  o improvement in the short   term.    While commodity prices have rebounded somewhat during the   first   quarter   of fiscal 2017  , net farm income in the U.S. is projected   to be   at the lowest level since 200  9  , leading to uncertainty among growers   and   resulting in downward pressure on irrigation equipment demand and pricing.    In the international markets, regional political and economic factors, currency conditions and local competition create a challenging environment.  Additionally, international results are heavily dependent upon project sales   which tend to fluctuate   and can be difficult to forecast   accurately  .

The Company remains confident in the long-term drivers for efficient agricultural irrigation and water use efficiency globally.  The Company has expanded global capacity with the opening of a factory in Turkey that began manufacturing operations in March 2015.  While the additional capacity from the plant in Turkey has created some short-term fixed   overhead cost   absorption challenges, the Company is confident in the incremental profit potential of global expansion plans and the long-term growth opportunities throughout the region, including in the European, Middle Eastern and African markets. 

I  n a global environment of constrained government spending  , d  emand for the Company s transportation safety products continues to be driven by population growth and the need for improved   safety  .  In the United States, the enactment o  f a $305 billion   bill   in   December 2015     to fund highway, bridge an  d transit projects over the subsequent   five years creates opportunities for market growth in each of the road safety product lines.  While the outlook for infrastructure products in international markets continues to be positive, global or economic slowdowns could negatively impact government spending and have a resultant negative impact on demand   for the Company s products   in certain regions.  Domestically, the Federal Highway Administration has mandated a change to certification standards for road safety products to be phased in beginning in 2018  .  H  owever, individual states may mandate the adoption of these standards earlier.    This change has required additional research and development spending and could have an impact on the competitive positioning of the Company s highway safety products.    Overall, the Company s outlook for infrastructure continues to be positive, although somewhat mitigated by the possibilities of a global economic slowdown and increased regulatory requirements.  

As of   November 30, 2016  , the Company had an order backlog of   $55.9   million   compared with $  61.9   million   at   November 30, 2015   and $  50.7   million   at   August 31, 2016  .  The Company s backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality, cyclicality, timing and execution of contracts.  Backlog typically represents long-term projects as well as short lead-time orders, and therefore is generally not a good indication of the next fiscal quarter s revenues. 

The global drivers for the Company s markets of population growth, expanded food production, efficient water use and infrastructure expansion support the Company s long-term growth goals.  The most significant opportunities for growth over the next several years are in international markets, where irrigation use is less developed and demand is driven primarily by food security, water scarcity and population growth.  In the United States, the focus on converting dryland acres to irrigated cropland while increasing the efficiency of water utilization will have an impact on future irrigation equipment demand.

Results of Operations 

For the Three Months ended   November 30, 2016   compared to the Three Months ended   November 30, 2015 

The following section presents an analysis of the Company s operating results displayed in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  .        It should be read together with the industry segment information in Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements: 

Revenues 

Operating revenues for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   declined   nine   percent to $  110.4   million   from $  121.6   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  , as   irrigation revenues decreased $  11.5   million and infrastructure revenues in  creased   $0.2   million  .  The irrigation segment provided   81   percent of the Company s revenue for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   as compared to   83   percent for   the three months ended   November 30, 2015  . 

U.S. irrigation revenues for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   of $  50.3   million   decreased   $8.9   million   or   15   percent from $  59.2   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  ,    primarily due to a reduction in irrigation system unit volume as falling commodity prices and reduced farm income negatively impacted demand for irrigation equipment  .   

International irrigation revenues for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   of $  39.5   million de  creased   $2.6   million   or   six   percent from $  42.1   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .    Changes in foreign currency translation rates compared to the same prior year period had a favorable impact on revenues of approximately three percent.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, international irrigation revenues decreased nine percent for the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the same prior year period, as improved sales volume in Brazil, Africa and the Middle East were more than offset by declines in other markets  .   

Infrastructure segment revenues for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   of $  20.5   million in  creased   $0.2   million   or   one   percent from $  20.3   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .  The increase resulted from higher sales volume in road safety products offset by lower   Road Zipper  system project sales and lease revenue compared with the same period in the prior year.

Gross Profit 

Gross profit for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   of $  28.4   million   decreased   18   percent from $  34.4   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .    The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower irrigation sales and a decline   in gross margin to   25.7   percent for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   from   28.3   percent for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .    Improved gross margin in the infrastructure segment was more than offset by lower gross margin in the irrigation segment.    Irrigation margin decreased over three percentage points compared to the prior year due to lower overhead cost absorption from lower unit volume, increased product warranty costs due to a specific component field-fix, and changes in the international regional mix of sales.  Infrastructure margin improved almost two percentage points as the result of improved cost absorption in Road Zipper      system production and volume leverage from road safety product sales. 

Operating Expenses 

O  perating expenses of $  25.6   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   increased by $  3.0   million   over operating expenses in the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .    Operating expenses in the first quarter of the prior year were lowered by the reversal of a $1.2 million bad debt reserve related to the collection of a previously reserved account.  Increased operating expenses in the first quarter of the current year resulted primarily from higher new product development and testing costs, some specific project-related legal and outside consulting service fees, and higher personnel-related costs.      Operating expenses were   23.2   percent of sales for the three months ended   November 30, 2016     compared to   18.6   percent of sales for the three months ended   November 30, 2015  .    

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of   $0.5   million   and $  3.5   million   for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively.  The effective income tax rate was   34.6   percent and   33.2   percent for the three months ended   November 30, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , respectively.  The in  crease in the effective income tax rate from   November   201  5   to   November   2016 primarily   relates to the earnings mix among jurisdictions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $  103.1   million   at   November 30, 2016   compared with $  129.3   million   at   November 30, 2015   and $  101.2   million   at   August 31, 2016  .  The Company requires cash for financing its receivables and inventories, paying operating expenses and capital expenditures, and for dividends and share repurchases.  The Company meets its liquidity needs and finances its capital expenditures from its available cash and funds provided by operations along with borrowings under its credit arrangements described below.  The Company believes its current cash resources, projected operating cash flow, and remaining capacity under its continuing bank lines of credit are sufficient to cover all of its expected working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and dividends.  The Company may require additional borrowings to fund potential acquisitions in the future.  

The Company s total cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was approximately   $38.8   million, $30.8 million and $34.6 million   as of   November 30, 2016  ,    November 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2016  , respectively.  The Company considers earnings in foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested in those subsidiaries and would need to accrue and pay taxes if such earnings were repatriated to the United States.  Accordingly, the Company does not intend to repatriate the funds, and does not expect these funds to have a significant impact on the Company s overall liquidity.    

Net working capital was $  190.3   million   at   November 30, 2016  , as compared with $  208.8   million   at   November 30, 2015   and   $188.9   million   at   August 31, 2016  . Cash provided by operations totaled   $8.1   million   during the   three   months ended   November 30, 2016  , a decrease of $  0.4   million   compared to cash provided by operations of   $8.5   million   during the   three   months ended   November 30, 2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings as well as changes in working capital.  

Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $  1.4   million   during the   three   months ended   November 30, 2016   compared to   $4.2   million   used in investing activities during the   three   months ended   November 30, 2015  .  The   decreas  e is primarily attributable to a decrease in capital spending  .    Capital spending was    $  1.4   million   in the first   three   months of fiscal 2017   compared to capital spending of $  4.7   million   in the same period of the prior fiscal year. 

Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $  3.8   million   during the   three   months ended   November 30, 2016   compared to cash flows   used in   financing activities of $  13.1   million   during the   same prior year period.  The de  crease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due t  o a $9.2 million reduction in the repurchase   of common shares   for fiscal 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year  .   

Capital Allocation Plan 

The Company s capital allocation plan is to continue investing in revenue and earnings growth, combined with a defined process for enhancing returns to stockholders. Under the Company s announced capital allocation plan in January 2014, the priorities for uses of cash include: 

-      19      - 

Table of Contents  

Investment in organic growth including capital expenditures and expansion of international markets,     

Dividends to stockholders, along with expectations to increase dividends on an annual basis,     

Synergistic water-related acquisitions that provide attractive returns to stockholders, and     

Opportunistic share repurchases taking into account cyclical and seasonal fluctuations.      

Capital Expenditures 

Capi  tal expenditures for fiscal 2017 are estimated to be between $14.0 million and $17  .0   million   largely focused   on manufacturing capacity expansion   and productivity improvements.  The Company s management does maintain flexibility to modify the amount and timing of some of the planned expenditures in response to economic conditions. 

Dividends 

In the first   quarter of fi  scal   2017  , the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.29   per common share  ,   or   a total of $3.1   million,   to stockholders as compared to   $0.28   per common share or   $3.1   million   in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  .    

Share Repurchases 

On January 3, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $150.0   million   of common stock through January 2, 2016.  On July 22, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors increased its outstanding share repurchase authorization by $100.0   million   with no expiration.  Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions as well as under formalized trading plans in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.    There were no share repurchases for   the   three   months ended   November 30, 2016  .  During the     three   months ended     November 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   136,263   shares   of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $9.2   million  .    The remaining amount available under the repurchase program was   $  63.7   million   as of   November 30, 2016  .    

Long-Term Borrowing Facilities 

Series A, Senior Notes.        On February 19, 2015, the Company issued $115.0   million   in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, Series A (the  Senior Notes ).  The entire principal of the Senior Notes is due and payable on February 19, 2030.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually at a fixed annual rate of 3.82 percent and borrowings under the Senior Notes are unsecured.  The Company intends to use the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. 

Revolving Credit Facility  .    On February 18, 2015, the Company entered into a $50   million   unsecured Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association   ( Wells Fargo )  . The Re  volving Credit Facility replaced   a previous revolving c  redit facility from Wells Fargo   originally entered into on January 24, 2008 and last amended on January 22, 2014.  The Company intends to use borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for working capital purposes and to fund acquisitions. At   November 30, 2016   and   November 30, 2015  , the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  The amount of borrowings available at any time under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit   issued by Wells Fargo   then outstanding.  At   November 30, 2016  , the Company had the ability to borrow up to   $43.8   million under the Revolving Credit Facility  , after consideration of outstanding standby letters of credit of   $6.2   million  . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 90 basis points (  1.52   percent at   November 30, 2016  ), subject to adjustment as set forth in the loan documents for the Revolving Credit Facility.  Interest is paid on a monthly to quarterly basis depending on loan type.  The Company also pays an annual commitment fee of 0.25 percent on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.  Unpaid principal and interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is due by February 18, 2018. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility have equal priority with borrowings under the Company s Senior Notes.  Each of the credit arrangements described above include certain covenants relating primarily to the Company s financial condition. These financial covenants include a funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  Upon the occurrence of any event of default of these covenants, including a change in control of the Company, all amounts outstanding thereunder may be declared to be immediately due and payable.  At   November 30, 2016  ,    November 30, 2015   and   August 31, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial loan covenants contained in its credit arrangements in place as of each of those dates. 

Elecsys Series 2006A Bonds  .    Elecsys Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has outstanding   $2.1   million   in principal amount of industrial revenue bonds that were issued in 2006 (the  Series 2006A Bonds ).  Principal and interest on the Series 2006A Bonds are payable monthly through maturity on September 1, 2026.  The interest rate is adjustable based on the yield of the 5-year United States Treasury Notes, plus 0.45 percent (  2.28   percent as of   November 30, 2016  ).  The obligations under the Series 2006A Bonds are secured by a first priority security interest in certain real estate.

1   

3.      Effective Date  

The Plan shall be effective as of September   1  ,    201  6     and will be in effect for the   201  7     bonus year.  The   201  7     bonus year is defined as September 1,   201  6     through August 31,   201  7  . 

4.      Eligibility for Participation  

A.      Participation in the Plan is limited to individuals in positions which have significant responsibility for and impact on the Company s corporate performance. 

B.      Only the Chief Executive Officer and those employees in grades   H     through   J     (elected officers as noted in the annual report)   are eligible to be considered for participation in the Plan.   

C.      Participation in the Plan does not guarantee or entitle any employee to participate in any bonus plan enacted in the future.  Participation in the Plan at any target bonus level does not guarantee or entitle any employee to be eligible to participate at any similar target bonus level in any bonus plan which may be enacted in the future. 

5.      Enrollment in the Plan  

A.      Initial Enrollment    

At the beginning of the Plan year, each Participant must be enrolled in the Plan subject to the approvals and eligibility criteria set forth in Sections 4 and 6.     The enrollment process is as follows:     

i.      Plan Participants will participate in the Plan at the standard target percent per grade level as listed in Section 6.  

ii.      The Company s Chief Executive Officer will review the participant list and projected bonus costs of enrolled employees with the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee provides final approval on the aggregate potential cost of the Plan. 

2   

B.      Mid-year Enrollment    

When hiring or promoting employees during the Plan year who may be eligible for participation in the Plan, the following procedures must be followed: 

i.      Prior to the commencement of the recruiting or promotion process, the hiring manager consults with Human Resources to determine the position s eligibility for participation in the Plan and the recommended target bonus amount.    

ii.      Offer letters indicating   bonus Plan participation and target bonus award opportunities to new hires and/or promoted employees must be reviewed by the CEO or, in the case of a Named Executive Officer, by the Compensation   Committee.  Target bonus recommendations must be approved before communication to a prospective Participant.  Generally, employees hired or promoted during the fourth quarter   201  7     are not eligible to participate in the   201  7     Plan. 

6.      Determination of Target Payout Levels  

A.      Incentive awards will be calculated as a percentage of the Participant s   annual     base salary received during the Plan year  , provided that annual base salary increases which are made during the first quarter of the Plan year will be treated for purposes of calculating a Participant s bonus as if they had been made at the beginning of the Plan year  .    The impact of promotions or other adjustments to base pay made after the annual pay adjustment noted above will be prorated for the time in effect.    While award amounts will vary based on the range of award opportunity and an assessment of individual performance results, the target award opportunities for each grade level are shown below: 

i.      Actual participation   is subject to approval by the CEO   and   by the Compensation Committee.  Actual participation is based on an assessment of the individual's position impact on the organization. 

ii.      Standard target percents per grade level should be followed for all Plan Participants. 

B.      If a Participant s Plan target award opportunity (Target % of Salary as set forth above) changes due to promotion into a grade level with a higher target bonus, the Participant s bonus will be calculated based on his or her   annual     salary during the  

3   

Plan year and a   pro-rated   bonus   award  .  The   pro-rated   bonus   award     will reflect the portion of the Plan year spent in each grade level (e.g.,   26   weeks   at   40  % and   2  6   weeks   at   50  %).  In evaluating the performance of Participants who change positions during the Plan year, consideration will be giv  en to the length of time and results in each position.  Actual award decisions will be made by the CEO or, in the case of a Named Executive Officer, by the Compensation Committee.  Generally, fourth quarter promotions will not result in an increase in a Participant s target award opportunity.     

C.      Examples of various award calculations are included with this Plan document as Attachment A.    

D.      [Intentionally omitted.]    

E.      The Compensation Committee will determine the award payments to the Named Executive Officers.    

F.      Award payments will be calculated on an annual basis and paid in accordance with the Company s normal payroll cycle.  Payments will be made   within 75 days   following the Plan year.  The payment date may be changed at any time and for any reason at the discretion of the CEO, or in the case of a Named Executive Officer, with approval of the Compensation Committee  ,   but may not be later than   March   15 following the end of the Plan year for which the award is paid  .    

7.      Basis of Awards  

A.      Measurable performance objectives for each Plan Participant will be established at the beginning of the Plan year (or at mid-year for mid-year hires or newly eligible employees).  In   201  7  , consideration   will be given to:    

i.      Financial   Performance Component:  Company   and Market financial   performance vs. Plan performance objectives in accordance with Section 7B.    

ii.      Individual Performance Component:  Participant s performance relative to individual goals established in accordance with Section 7C. 

4   

iii.      Individual and   Financial   Performance Components will be added to reach a Participant s total bonus. The relative weighting will vary by grade in accordance with the following schedule: 

B.      At the beginning of the Plan year, the objectives for the Financial Performance Component are identified and approved by the Compensation Committee. 

i.      Recommended award amounts may range from 0 - 200% of the Financial Performance Component of the Participant s target award, based on performance.        

ii.      Percentages between the threshold,   intermediate,   target, and maximum award will be interpolated. 

iii.      In the even  t of an acquisition, revenue  ,   operating income  ,    expense  s,    fees  , assets  ,     l  iabilities     and acquisition fees   resulting from the acquisition will be excluded from award payout calculations, unless   the Compensation Committee approves a modification   to include any such items  . 

iv.      A  ward payout calculations shall exclude the positive or negative impact of any adjustments to the accrual for environmental remediation liability   or unbudgeted expenses   related to the   existing contamination at the Lindsay facility as   disclosed in the Company s SEC filings.  

C.      The Individual Performance Component will be based on written objectives set annually for Participants by their supervisors and approved by the CEO or, in the case of a Named Executive Officer, by the Compensation Committee.  Objectives will be based on the Participant s position and may be financial, operational or strategic. 

i.      Objectives under the Individual Performance Component may be linked to team-based goals, if appropriate 

ii.      Examples of appropriate objectives under the Individual Performance Component include: 

Safety 

Customer Service 

Market Share 

5   

On-time Delivery 

Cost Reduction 

Product Development 

iii.      Recommended award amounts may range from 0% - 200% of the target amount under the Individual Performance Component.  Recommended award amounts will be based on an assessment of the individual s performance relative to objectives established under the Individual Performance Component, in accordance with the following guidelines: 

Individual  
					 
						 Performance  

Payout  
					 
						 (as % of Target Individual Performance Component)

Exceeds objectives  

150%  

Significantly exceeds objectives  

200%  

iv.      The  Payout (as % of Target Individual Performance Component)  represents the payout relative to target award for the Individual Performance Component of the Plan. 

v.      With respect to the CEO only, the CEO shall be entitled to an award amount equal to the maximum 200% of the target amount under his or her Individual Performance Component if the Company achieves at least $1 million of operating income in fiscal 201  7  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee shall have negative discretion to reduce such award amount to an amount   calculated based on   the CEO s   Individual Performance in a   manner consistent with the assessment of   the   performance of other executives relative to objectives established under their respective Individual Performance Components.    

8.      Changes in Employment Status  

A.      Participants who cease to be employees of the Company during the Plan year   will not be eligible to receive an award.    Participants who were employed   as of   the end of the   Plan   year, but whose employment is terminated prior to the payment date, will continue to be eligible to receive an award.    Any exceptions will require the approval of the CEO, or in the case of a Named Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee. 

B.      In the event that a Participant transfers out of an eligible position into an ineligible position within the Company, the employee may be eligible for a prorated bonus  

6   

award based upon the approval of the CEO, or in the case of a Named Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee.    

C.      In all cases awards will be calculated and paid according to the provisions in Section  s 6 and 7 of this Plan document. 

9.             Administration

B.      This plan is being adopted pursuant to   and shall be subject to the terms of   the Management Incentive Umbrella Plan as approved by stockholders on January 2  7  , 20  14  .   

C.      The Company reserves the right to amend or change the Plan in whole or in part at any time during the Plan year.  Amendments to the Plan require the approval of the Compensation Committee. 

D.      Participation in the Plan does not constitute a contract of employment nor a contractual agreement of payment.  It shall not affect the right of the Company to discharge, transfer, or change the position of a Participant.  The Plan shall not be construed to limit or prevent the Company from adopting or changing, from time to time, any rules, standards or procedures affecting the Participant s employment with the Company or any Company affiliate, including those which affect bonus payouts. 

E.      If any provision of this Plan is found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, that provision shall be severed from the Plan.  If such a provision is severed, this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the severed provision had never been part of it and the remaining provisions of this Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the severed provisions or by its severance from this Plan.  In place of any severed provision there shall be added automatically as part of this Plan a provision as similar in terms to the severed provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable. 

E.     This is not an ERISA plan.  This is a bonus program.
