NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS   

On June 3, 2013, Teardroppers, Inc. (the  Company ),
was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada. 

We intend to enter the business of mobile billboard
advertising by offering to provide billboard advertising space on custom designed  Teardrop Trailers . Teardrop Trailers,
are usually designed for short-period accommodations for vacationers and travelers. Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed
behind small economy sized vehicles and pickup trucks. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis of presentation   

The Company s financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 

Interim Financial
Statements   

 The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and
with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In our opinion the financial
statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary in order to make the financial statements
not misleading. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
final results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. For more complete financial information, these unaudited
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed
with the SEC. 

   Use of estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates
include management s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives of assets, and related depreciation
and amortization methods applied. 

Cash equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

Fair value of financial instruments   

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 (the  Fair Value Topic ) which defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

The Fair Value Topic defines fair value as
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. It
requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. It also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. 

The carrying amount of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue approximate
their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s note payable approximates the fair value
of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar
financial arrangements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company had no assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis for as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using the market and income
approaches. 

Property and equipment   

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, five
(5) years for automobile, and seven (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the
related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. 

Revenue recognition   

The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1
of the FASB ASC for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company
considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or
determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records allowances for accounts receivable
that are estimated to not be collected. 

The primary source of revenue will be
from the rental of advertising space on custom designed Teardrop Trailers. The length of the rental agreements will vary from
one to thirty days. Customers will pay in advance and revenue will recognized based on the number of days of each contract that
have expired. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $6,010 from the rental of the trailers. 

Net income (loss) per share   

The Company computes basic and diluted earnings
per share amounts pursuant to ASC 260-10-45. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of
any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the period 

The diluted weighted average number of common
shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first day of the year for any potentially diluted
debt or equity. 

There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Reclassification   

Prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation. 

Subsequent events   

The Company follows the guidance in ASC 855-10-50
for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements
were issued. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless
otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued
that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN    

The Company's consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification
of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company has a minimum cash balance available
for payment of ongoing operating expenses. Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating
plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be
available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION  

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose any statements contained in
this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.  Without limiting
the foregoing, words such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate, 
 estimate  or  continue  or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
 These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending
on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control.  These factors include but are not limited to economic
conditions generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition
from much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships. 

Business of The Company    

The Teardroppers, Inc., (the  Company ),
is a Nevada corporation which was formed in June of 2013. 

Mobile Billboard Advertising    

We intend to enter the business of mobile billboard
advertising by offering to provide billboard advertising space on custom designed  Teardrop Trailers . Teardrop Trailers,
are usually designed for short-period accommodations for vacationers and travelers. Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed
behind small economy sized vehicles and pickup trucks. A Teardrop Trailer, also known as a  Teardrop Camper Trailer ,
is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. We have ordered the
assembly of one Teardrop Trailer from an independent partnership (the  Partnership ), based upon Teardrop Trailer designs
provided by the Partnership and approved by us. This Teardrop Trailer was delivered on January 15, 2015. In addition, we ordered
a  Kit  from the Partnership, along with a custom chassis from an independent supplier recommended by the Partnership,
which enables us to assemble our first Teardrop Trailer. The Teardrop Trailer assembled from this Kit was assembled by an independent
contractor and was delivered to us on December 31, 2014. Due to manufacturing limitations of the Partnership, we determined that
it would be faster and more efficient to assemble a completed Teardrop Trailer from a Kit then to wait for delivery of a completed
Teardrop Trailer from the Partnership. In the future, we intend to obtain additional Teardrop Trailers by using a Kit and independent
contractors to assemble the Kit. 

The Teardrop Trailer    

Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed
behind small economy sized vehicles, pickup trucks and any qualified tow vehicles. A Teardrop Trailer, also known as a  Teardrop
Camper Trailer , is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile.
We have ordered the assembly of one Teardrop Mobile Trailer from the Partnership at a contract price of $5,000. The cost to assemble
the Teardrop Trailer from the Kit is a total of $4,995($3,000 for the Kit, $495 for the chassis, and $1,500 for the services of
the independent contractor to assemble the Kit on the chassis.) 

Our Teardrop Trailers will be approximately
4 feet (1.2 m) in width and 10 feet (3.0 m) in length and 5 feet (1.5 m) in height Wheels and tires are outside the body and are
covered by fenders. Our Teardrop Trailers will be covered with thin sheets of aluminum. Since Teardrop Trailers are relatively
light, most vehicles can tow a Teardrop Trailer and have little effect on the vehicle's fuel consumption. We do not intend to lease
our Teardrop Trailers for camping or recreational use. However, our first trailer will be configured in a camping trailer configuration
so as to enhance the residual value of the trailer. We believe that some of our future rental customers, who will rent our trailers
for longer periods, may use the interior space for their personnel's comfort or for storage. 

Our trailers will be assembled upon a chassis
that has tail lights, wiring, fenders, wheels and a trailer hitch that is compliant with Federal and State regulations. We have
no formal relationship with any trailer chassis manufacturer, but we believe that many manufacturers will continue to offer a chassis
that we will utilize in our trailers. In the event that chassis become unavailable, our business would be adversely affected as
we would then have to adjust our designs to fit chassis available from other sources. 

Marketing   

We intend to market our advertising and design
services through our website www.tdropmobile.com. We have hired an independent web-site developer to develop our website, which
was completed on December 14, 2014. In addition, we intend to offer our mobile billboard advertising services through traditional
marketing channels, such as trade journals, trade catalogues, yellow pages advertising, and through the personal contacts of our
Management. Marketing of our mobile billboard advertising has already commenced as we have made several proposals to motor sports
events and advertisers to use our services. We also market our consulting services through personal contacts of our officers and
majority shareholder. 

We have chosen the unique shape and look of
a Teardrop Trailer as our advertising platform as we believe its  eye appeal  will be attractive to a target audience's
view and retention of the adverting images which will appear on the Teardrop Trailer. 

We intend to offer advertising space on our
trailers. Advertisement will be installed by applying decals, large vinyl sheets as decals or by fastening one large
sheet of vinyl to the sides and top of the trailer. In addition, we will offer to provide our tow vehicle and a driver. 

We believe that the mobile billboard outdoor
advertising will offer to advertisers: 

Event Marketing   

New Product Launches   

Retail Store Openings    

Grand Openings   

Tradeshow Advertising   

Political Advertising and Campaigning   

Publicity   

Concerts   

Sporting Events   

Conventions   

Trade Shows   

Outdoor Festivals   

Beach Cities and Events   

Grand Openings   

Holiday Events   

Motion Picture Premiers   

We believe that mobile billboard outdoor advertising
offers certain advantages to advertisers, among which include: 

Mobile trailers are flexible providing one with a wide variety of space and cost options, which can be used for anything from short sales promotions to being part of a long-term brand awareness campaign.   

Instead of hoping people see an advertisement, the advertisements are brought to them.   

They are more cost effective than other forms of advertising.   

We can park the trailer in front of a business or a competitor's.   

We can thoroughly saturate a specific area unlike regular billboards, radio, TV or direct mail.   

We can provide specific demographic routes so that there are multiple exposures.   

Mobile billboards create impact because of their movement, size and prominence on the road and can go where other advertising can t. They merely have to be visible to attract attention.   

We can provide advertisements in the middle of all the activity at a special event like a tournament, fair, tradeshow, sporting event et. al.   

As they are eye-level with consumers, the message is communicated directly, increasing the impact of the product.   

We will also offer to work closely with our
clients to fully understand the client's marketing objectives. We will used our best efforts to identify the highest profile locations
in our client's target market in order to provide the most efficient, high exposure, high impact and cost-effective mobile billboard
advertising campaign. 

At every stage of the process, our services
will include design, branding and selection of graphics, to achieve maximum results. Audio, illumination, promotional sampling
and other sensory elements can be added to further enhance an advertising message. 

Our rates will be negotiated at time of agreement
with our client. Our rates will be based upon the range of services, length of the advertising contract, number of vehicles used,
miles traveled, length of campaign, ancillary costs and other variables. Generally, we anticipate our rates to be $995 for the
design and application, and removal of graphics to a trailer; $295 per day for the use of the trailer; $175 per day for a tow vehicle
and driver, based upon a 6 hour day. There will be a 3 day minimum for each trailer rental.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The Company's financial

in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification
of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company has a
minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses and has incurred losses since inception and anticipates
future losses in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. . Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional
debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available
on terms acceptable to the Company.

of $111,621. The decrease between the two periods was largely due to a $108,141 increase in accounts payable.
