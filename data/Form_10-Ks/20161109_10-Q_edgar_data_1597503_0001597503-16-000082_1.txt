    Business and Organization 
     NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. ( NSAM  or the  Company ) is a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally.  The Company commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. ( NorthStar Realty ) of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company, NSAM, a Delaware corporation (the  NSAM Spin-off ).  The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty s common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of the Company s common stock on a   one  -for-  one   basis.  At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by an affiliate of the Company through a management contract with an initial term of   20 years  .  NorthStar Realty continues to operate its commercial real estate ( CRE ) debt origination business. 
  NSAM LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of the Company (the  Operating Partnership ) holds substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities and the Company conducts its operations, directly or indirectly, through the Operating Partnership.  All references herein to the Company refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires. 
  On October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the spin-off of its European real estate business (the  NRE Spin-off ) into a separate publicly-traded real estate investment trust ( REIT ), NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. ( NorthStar Europe ).  The Company manages NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as the Company s management agreement with NorthStar Realty.  NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe are herein collectively referred to as the NorthStar Listed Companies.  
  The Company has a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital and through various vehicles that include REITs, closed-end funds and others that the Company may form in the future.  The Company earns various fees from managing this capital and refers to this platform as the Company s Retail Business.  Certain of the Company s affiliates also manage NorthStar Realty s previously sponsored non-traded companies which raise capital through the retail market, as well as any new non-traded company and any future sponsored company that raises capital from retail investors (referred to as the  Retail Companies  and together with the NorthStar Listed Companies, referred to as the  Managed Companies ).   
  The Company is organized to provide asset management and other services to the Managed Companies, or any other companies it may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally.  The Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry.  The Company seeks to expand the scope of its asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures.  Such investments have included the acquisition of an   84%   interest in Townsend Holdings LLC (or  Townsend ), a   43%   interest in American Healthcare Investors LLC (or the  AHI Interest ) and a   45%   interest in Island Hospitality Management Inc. (the  Island Interest ). 
  On January 29, 2016, the Company acquired an approximate   84%   interest in Townsend (the  Townsend Acquisition Date ), a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets.  Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to   $183.7 billion   of real assets as of   September 30, 2016  .  Townsend s management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations, subject to the oversight and direction of its board of directors which is controlled by the Company. 
  The Company earns asset management and other fees, directly or indirectly, pursuant to management and other contracts and direct investments.  In addition, the Company owns NorthStar Securities, LLC ( NorthStar Securities ), a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) which raises capital in the retail market for the Retail Companies. 
  Merger Agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. ( Colony ) under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform (the  Mergers ).  The transaction has been approved by the Company s and NorthStar Realty s respective boards of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective Special Committees and the board of directors of Colony. 
  Under the terms of the merger agreement, as amended, the Company will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as a REIT beginning in 2017 and NorthStar Realty and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc.  The Company s common stockholders will receive   one

share of Colony NorthStar s common stock for each share of common stock they own.  Upon completion of the transaction, NorthStar Realty stockholders will own approximately   33.90%  , Colony stockholders will own approximately   33.25%   and the Company s stockholders will own approximately   32.85%   of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, excluding the effect of certain equity-based awards issuable in connection with the Mergers.  Prior to the closing of the Mergers, the Company expects its board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof to declare a special cash dividend in the amount of   $228 million   to common stockholders. 
  In October 2016, the Company amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for the Company s executive officers and a special cash dividend for the Company s stockholders now totaling   $228 million  .  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, the Company entered into a voting agreement with MSD Capital L.P. ( MSD ) and its affiliates, which together own approximately   10.2%   of the Company s outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals.  In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of NSAM that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company following the completion of the Mergers, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement of the Company, Colony and NorthStar Realty and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of the Company s, Colony s and NorthStar Realty s respective stockholder approvals. 
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.  The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended     December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the SEC. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities ( VIE ) where the Company is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by the Company.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  The Company bases its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. 
  The Company reassesses its initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Company and the other interests.  The Company reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 
  The Company evaluates the Managed Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which the Company is the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE.  The Company analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If the Company has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  The Company does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote. 
  The Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method. 
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  The Company may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  The Company may record the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow or may follow the practical expedient of the net asset value of the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is generally on a one quarter lag.  The Company will record the change from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss). 
  The Company may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if the Company determines the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment. 
  The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which the Company did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, the Company considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Non-controlling Interests 
  A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.  A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to non-controlling interests.  An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.

Redeemable Non-controlling Interests 
  A redeemable non-controlling interest is the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary in which the holders have the ability to require the Company to repurchase interests in the subsidiary.  These interests are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests, outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.  The Company records the redeemable non-controlling interest at its redemption value and adjusts the carrying amount of such interest to the redemption value at the end of each reporting period, but such amount will not be less than the initial carrying amount.  An allocation to a redeemable non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to current period presentation. 
  Cash 
  The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less and deposits held with third parties that are readily convertible to cash to be cash equivalents.  Cash, including amounts restricted at certain banks and financial institutions and amounts held outside of the United States, may at times exceed insurable amounts.  The Company mitigates credit risk by placing cash with major financial institutions.  To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on cash. 
  Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash primarily represents cash held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries due to certain regulatory capital requirements.  
  Business Combinations 
  The Company accounts for purchases of assets that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method where the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair value.  The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill.  Such valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets including, but not limited to, customer relationships, acquired technology and trade names.  Management s estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates.  During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings.

Other intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is expected to be realized. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and evaluates the recoverability

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  In making such assessment, qualitative factors are used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then an impairment loss is recorded.

           (2) 
    Represents a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to non-executive incentive interests in the advisor to our first sponsored Retail Company (refer to Note 3). 
              (3) 
    Relates to the purchase of NorthStar Realty shares which were settled in January 2016 (refer to Note 6). 
     Fair Value Option 
  The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition.  The Company may elect to apply the fair value option for certain investments due to the nature of the instrument.  Any change in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made is recognized in earnings. 
  Securities 
  The Company elected to apply the fair value option for its securities investments because management believes it is a more useful presentation for such investments.  Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.  Dividend income is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Deferred Financing Costs 
  Deferred financing costs represent legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing.  Costs related to revolving credit facilities are recorded in other assets and are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line basis over the term of the facility.  Costs related to other borrowings are recorded net against the carrying value of such borrowings and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.  Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated facility is repaid before maturity.  Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions, which do not close, if any, are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not occur. 
     Revenue Recognition 
  Asset Management and Other Fees 
  Asset management and other fees include base and incentive fees earned from NorthStar Listed Companies, acquisition, disposition and other fees earned from the Retail Companies and fees earned from clients and limited partners of Townsend.  Asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned.  Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents.  Incentive fees that are subject to contingent repayment are not recognized as revenue until all related contingencies have been resolved. 
  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by the Company for selling equity in the Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities.  Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.  As of   September 30, 2016  , commission payable of   $0.9 million   includes   $0.2 million   due to NorthStar Securities  employees. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
  An allowance for a doubtful account is established when, in the opinion of the Company, a full recovery of a receivable becomes doubtful.  A receivable is written off when it is no longer collectible and/or legally discharged.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $0.1 million   of allowance for doubtful accounts. 
  Equity-Based Compensation 
  The Company accounts for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees (refer to Note 9), using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award.  Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof.  For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.  For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method.  For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte

     Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis. 
  For awards with a combination of performance or market measures, the Company estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards.  First, the Company estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure.  If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, the Company records the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above.  This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met.  If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, the Company records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure.  The Company would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense. 
  Equity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date.  The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any. 
  Foreign Currency 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the spot currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction.  The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The Company reports consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in a separate statement following the consolidated statements of operations.  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI.  The component of OCI includes an adjustment for foreign currency translation. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  The Company s basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated using the two-class method for each class of common stock and participating security as if all earnings had been distributed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding.  Diluted EPS reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur from the Company s share-based compensation, consisting of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance common stock or other contracts to issue common stock, assuming performance hurdles have been met, were converted to common stock, including limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership which are structured as profits interests ( LTIP Units ).  Potential dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation if they have an anti-dilutive effect in the period.  The Company s unvested restricted stock awards, certain RSUs and LTIPs Units contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and thus are participating securities.  Due to the existence of these participating securities, the two-class method of computing EPS is required, unless another method is determined to be more dilutive. 
  Under the two-class method, net income is first reduced for distributions declared on all classes of participating securities to arrive at undistributed earnings.  Under the two-class method, net loss is reduced for distributions declared on participating securities only if such security has the right to participate in the earnings of the entity and an objectively determinable contractual obligation to share in net losses of the entity. 
  Income Taxes 
  Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented.  On March 13, 2015, the Company restructured by forming the Company s new Operating Partnership, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from the Company for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit holders.  The Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including the Company.  For the period prior to March 13, 2015, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries filed consolidated federal income tax returns.  Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.  Such amounts arise from differences between the financial

reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted.  A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

  Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended     December 31, 2015   for further disclosure of the Company s significant accounting policies. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for the Company will be January 1, 2018.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined the Company s Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  In the first quarter 2016, the Company adopted this guidance and, as a result, the fair value of our interest in real estate private equity funds sponsored by Townsend of   $21.4 million   is not included in Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company did   no  t have any investments measured using net asset value as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have in its consolidated statement of cash flows.

Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee 
  The following table presents a summary of the fee arrangements and amounts earned from the NorthStar Listed Companies: 

__________________     
           (1) 
    The base management fee will increase by an amount equal to   1.5%   per annum of the sum of: the cumulative net proceeds of all future common equity and preferred equity issued, equity issued in exchange or conversion of exchangeable senior notes or stock-settlable notes based on the stock price at the date of issuance and any other issuances of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe operating partnerships, which are structured as profits interests (excluding units issued to the parent company and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership) by the NorthStar Listed Companies and cumulative cash available for distribution ( CAD ) of the NorthStar Listed Companies, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP units or other equity awards beginning the first full calendar quarter after the NSAM Spin-off and NRE Spin-off, respectively.  In addition, NorthStar Realty s equity interest in RXR Realty LLC ( RXR Realty ) and Aerium Group is structured so that the Company is entitled to the portion of distributable cash flow from each investment in excess of the   $10 million   minimum annual base amount. 
              (2) 
    The incentive fee is calculated by the product of   15%   or   25%   and CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, when such amount is within a certain hurdle multiplied by the weighted average shares outstanding of the NorthStar Listed Companies for the calendar quarter.

Payment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation 
  The NorthStar Listed Companies are each responsible for all of their direct costs and expenses and will reimburse the Company for costs and expenses incurred by the Company on their behalf.  In addition, the Company may allocate indirect costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the applicable NorthStar Listed Company s management agreements with the Company (the  G A Allocation ).  The Company s management agreements with the NorthStar Listed Companies each provide that the amount of the G A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i)   20.0%   of the combined total of: (a) the NorthStar Listed Companies  general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to the Company under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses from the Company to the NorthStar Listed Companies ( NorthStar Listed Companies  G A  and (b) the Company s general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any of the Managed Companies; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies  G A.  The G A Allocation may include the applicable NorthStar Listed Company s allocable share of the Company s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing such NorthStar Listed Company s affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to such NorthStar Listed Company s affairs.  The G A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies  affairs.  In addition, each NorthStar Listed Company will pay directly or reimburse the Company for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between the Company and any of its executives, employees or other service providers.

    Fair Value 
     Fair Value Measurement 
  The Company follows fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for its financial instruments.  The Company categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).   
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:  
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              (a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              (b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              (c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              (d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.   
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
  Securities 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s securities are valued using quoted prices in an active market, and as such, are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value is   $38.4 million   and   $46.2 million  , respectively. 
  Townsend Funds 
  The fair value of the Townsend Funds are estimated by the Company s proportionate share of net asset value provided by the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is on a one quarter lag.  The Company reviews the net asset value provided by the underlying fund investment managers on an ongoing basis and compares these values to the audited financial statements, as applicable.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value is   $21.4 million  . 
  Convertible Debt Investment 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s convertible debt investment to Distributed Finance is classified as an available-for-sale debt security and is recorded within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  The debt investment is valued based on unobservable inputs and as such, is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value is   $0.8 million  . 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  In addition to the above disclosures regarding financial assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value about all financial instruments.  The following disclosure of estimated fair value of financial instruments

was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value.  The fair value of other financial instruments such as receivables and payables is estimated to approximate their carrying value.  
  Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of the reporting date.  Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect fair value, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
  Term Loan 
  The Company uses term to maturity and LIBOR rates to estimate fair value.  This fair value measurement is based on observable inputs and as such, is classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the Term Loan is   $468.7 million  , which approximates fair value.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Litigation 
  The Company may be involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business.  Although the Company is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, the legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
  Merger Related Arrangements and Other Costs 
  The Company entered into fee arrangements with service providers and advisors pursuant to which certain fees incurred by the Company in connection with the Mergers will become payable only if the Company consummates the Mergers.  The Company has and will incur other professional fees related to the Mergers.  In addition, the Company will incur cash compensation expenses to executives and employees related to severance, retention and related costs.  There can be no assurances that the Company will complete this or any other transaction.

All of the vested and unvested equity-based awards granted by NorthStar Realty prior to the NSAM Spin-off remained outstanding following the NSAM Spin-off.  Appropriate adjustments were made to all awards to reflect the impact of NorthStar Realty s reverse stock split and the NSAM Spin-off, as described below. 
  NorthStar Realty s equity awards outstanding at the time of the NSAM Spin-off, including LTIP Units converted to common shares in connection with NorthStar Realty s internal corporate reorganization, were adjusted to relate to an equal number of shares of the Company s common stock or Deferred LTIP Units, as described below, but generally continue to remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the NSAM Spin-off.  Vesting conditions for outstanding awards were adjusted to reflect the impact of the NSAM Spin-off with respect to employment conditions for service-based awards and total stockholder return for performance-based awards.  The shares of the Company s common stock (representing LTIP Units previously issued by NorthStar Realty s operating partnership prior to the NSAM Spin-off) that remain subject to vesting after the NSAM Spin-off, as well as grants of shares of the Company s common stock subject to time-based vesting issued by the Company since the time of the NSAM Spin-off, are herein referred to as restricted stock. 
  Deferred LTIP Units outstanding immediately prior to the NSAM Spin-off were equity awards issued by NorthStar Realty which  represented the right to receive LTIP Units in NorthStar Realty s successor operating partnership or shares of NorthStar Realty common stock (subject to the same vesting conditions).  On March 13, 2015, such Deferred LTIP Units were settled in LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership, or shares of restricted stock, which remain subject to the same vesting conditions that applied to the Deferred LTIP Units. 
  Following the NSAM Spin-off, NorthStar Realty and the compensation committee of its board of directors (the  NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee ) continue to administer all awards issued under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans but the Company is obligated to issue shares of the Company s common stock or other equity awards of its subsidiaries or make cash payments in lieu thereof and the Company is obligated to make cash payments with respect to dividend or distribution equivalent obligations relating to such shares to the extent required by such awards previously issued under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans.  These awards will continue to be governed by the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans, as applicable, and shares of the Company s common stock issued pursuant to these awards will not be issued pursuant to, or reduce availability, under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans. 
  In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, most of NorthStar Realty s employees at the time of the NSAM Spin-off became employees of the Company except for executive officers, employees engaged in NorthStar Realty s loan origination business at the time of the NSAM Spin-off and certain other employees that became co-employees of both the Company and NorthStar Realty. 
  The following summarizes the equity-based compensation plans and related expenses. 
  NorthStar Asset Management Plans 
  NSAM Stock Plan 
  In March 2014, the NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee approved the NSAM Stock Plan, which was subsequently adopted by the Company s board of directors and approved by its sole stockholder at the time.  The NSAM Stock Plan was administered by the NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee prior to the NSAM Spin-off and is administered by the Company s compensation committee following the NSAM Spin-off.  The NSAM Stock Plan provides flexibility to use various equity-based and cash incentive awards as compensation tools to motivate the Company s workforce. 
  In anticipation of the NSAM Spin-off, on April 3, 2014, the Company granted an aggregate of   6,230,529   RSUs to its executive officers pursuant to the NSAM Stock Plan.  The RSUs vest over   four   years and are subject to the achievement of performance-based vesting conditions and continued employment.    40%   of these RSUs are performance-based awards and were subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles relating to CAD of the Company and NorthStar Realty and capital raising of the Retail Companies, as well as continued employment through December 31, 2017 ( Performance RSUs ).    30%   of these RSUs are market-based awards and are subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles relating to the Company s absolute total stockholder return and continued employment over a   four  -year period ended April 2, 2018 ( Absolute RSUs ).  The remaining   30%   of these RSUs are market-based awards and are subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles based on the Company s total stockholder return relative to the Russell 2000 Index and continued employment over a   four  -year period ended April 2, 2018 ( Relative RSUs ).  With respect to these grants, the grant date fair value for the Performance RSUs, Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs was   $17.01  ,   $10.22   and   $16.21   per RSU, respectively.  The grant date fair value was determined using a risk-free interest rate of   1.48%  .

value for the Performance RSUs, Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs was   $16.80  ,   $9.95   and   $16.29   per RSU, respectively.  The grant date fair value of the Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs was determined using a risk-free interest rate of   1.29%  .  In December 2014, the Company determined that the performance hurdles relating to the Performance RSUs were met.  On   December 31, 2014  , the Performance RSUs were settled in shares of the Company s common stock, of which   25%   were vested and the remainder (in the form of restricted stock) were subject to vesting in equal installments on   December 31, 2015  ,   2016   and   2017  , subject to continued employment.  In connection with the vesting of these shares, on   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company retired   370,943   and   392,157  , respectively, of the vested shares of common stock to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.  The common stock retired to satisfy the withholding amounts was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital with an offsetting payable recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  On   December 31, 2014  , the Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs related to the executives were settled in shares of performance common stock.  Upon vesting pursuant to the terms of the Absolute RSUs and Relative RSUs, shares of performance common stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock and the executive will be entitled to receive the distributions that would have been paid with respect to a share of common stock (for each share of performance common stock that vests) on or after the date the shares of performance common stock were initially issued. 
  NSAM Bonus Plan 
  In March 2014, the NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee approved the NSAM Bonus Plan, which was subsequently adopted by the Company s board of directors and approved by its sole stockholder.  The NSAM Bonus Plan establishes the general parameters of the Company s incentive bonus program for its executive officers.  Pursuant to the NSAM Bonus Plan, for each plan year, the administrator will establish   two   bonus pools (an annual cash bonus pool and a long-term bonus pool), award a bonus pool percentage(s) to each participant with respect to such bonus pools and establish performance goals, vesting requirements and other terms and conditions applicable to such bonuses.  The NSAM Bonus Plan was administered by the NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee prior to the NSAM Spin-off and is administered by the Company s compensation committee following the NSAM Spin-off.  Prior to the NSAM Spin-off, the NorthStar Realty Compensation Committee established bonus pools, awarded bonus pool percentages and established the performance goals, vesting requirements and other terms and conditions applicable to bonuses for 2014 under the NSAM Bonus Plan. 
  Long-term bonuses for 2014 were paid in both Company and NorthStar Realty equity-based awards, subject to performance-based and time-based vesting conditions over the   four  -year performance period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017.  Approximately   31.65%   of these long-term bonuses were subject to the achievement of performance-based hurdles relating to CAD of the Company and NorthStar Realty and capital raising of the Retail Companies in 2014 and were paid in shares of the Company s common stock that were subject to vesting in equal installments on each of   December 31, 2014  ,   2015  ,   2016   and   2017  , subject to continued employment.    18.35%   of these long-term bonuses are performance-based awards that were paid in shares of performance common stock that are subject to vesting based on the achievement of performance-based hurdles relating to the Company s absolute total stockholder return and continued employment over a   four  -year period.  The remaining approximately   50%   of long-term bonuses are being paid by NorthStar Realty. 
  In connection with the long-term bonuses for 2014, the Company determined that the performance hurdles for the approximately   31.65%   of the long-term bonuses to be paid in shares of the Company s common stock were met.  On   December 31, 2014  , the Company paid this portion of the long-term bonus by issuing   795,107   shares of common stock, of which   25%   vested immediately and the remainder (in the form of restricted stock) was subject to vesting in equal installments on   December 31, 2015  ,   2016   and 2017, subject to continued employment.  In connection with the vesting of these shares, on   December 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company retired   100,455   and   108,198  , respectively, of the vested shares of common stock to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding requirements.  In connection with the remainder of the long-term bonus to be paid by the Company, in February 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of   474,842   shares of performance common stock to executives, which are subject to vesting based on the Company s absolute total stockholder return and continued employment over the   four  -year period ending December 31, 2017.  With respect to these grants, the grant date fair value was   $21.16   per share, which was determined using a risk-free interest rate of   1.00%  .  Upon vesting, these shares of performance common stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock and the executives will be entitled to receive the distributions that would have been paid with respect to a share of common stock (for each share of performance common stock that vests) on or after January 1, 2015.  In February 2015, the Company also granted   605,144   shares of common stock, net of forfeitures occurring prior to   September 30, 2016  , to certain non-executive employees, subject to time based vesting conditions through January 29, 2018. 
  In the first quarter 2015, the Company s compensation committee established bonus pools, awarded bonus pool percentages and established the performance goals, vesting requirements and other terms and conditions applicable to bonuses for 2015 under the NSAM Bonus Plan.  Long-term bonuses for 2015 were paid in equity-based awards of the Company, NorthStar Realty and NorthStar

with respect to   50%   of these shares lapsing   two   years after the closing date of the Company s acquisition and the remaining   50%   lapsing   five   years after the closing date.  As a result of this vesting arrangement,   $10.0 million   of common stock (or   478,231   shares) subject to this arrangement is treated as a contingent consideration arrangement tied to continued employment of the AHI principals as an incentive to remain as employees of AHI.  As such, this contingent consideration arrangement is accounted for separately as a compensatory arrangement with amortization of such equity award being recorded by the Company through equity in earnings (losses).  The AHI principals are also entitled to incremental grants of the Company s common stock subject to certain conditions being met pursuant to a separate contractual arrangement entered into in connection with the Company s AHI investment.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   no   incremental awards were issued. 
  In March 2016, the Company issued approximately   94,000   shares of common stock to employees of AHI in settlement of the commitment to contribute   $1.0 million   in shares of common stock related to equity incentives and will contribute   $1.0 million   in shares of common stock in March 2017 related to the year ended 2016. 
  Townsend 
  Subsequent to the Company s acquisition of its interest in Townsend, in February 2016, the Company granted   658,330   shares of common stock to certain members of Townsend s management team who own the remaining interest in Townsend.  The grant was based on the Company s stock price on such date and is related to future services to be rendered and subject to time-based vesting conditions through December 31, 2020.  Such shares were not part of the acquisition cost.

    Stockholders  Equity 
     Share Repurchase 
  In April 2015, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $400 million   of its outstanding common stock.  In May 2016, the Company s board of directors extended the authorization for an additional year.  The authorization expires in April 2017, unless otherwise extended by the Company s board of directors.  From April 2015 through   December 31, 2015  , the Company repurchased   7.8 million   shares of its common stock for approximately   $105.2 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company did   no  t repurchase any shares of its common stock. 
  Call Spread 
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a call spread transaction (the  Call Spread ) with a third-party counterparty related to its share repurchase program.  In connection with the Call Spread, certain subsidiaries of the Company purchased and sold a call option on the Company s common stock with a notional amount of   $100.0 million   with various expiration dates beginning in December 2018 and a final maturity date in February 2019.  The obligation to the counterparty under the sold call option are guaranteed by the Company.  In October 2015, the Company paid a net premium of   $16.0 million  , which is recorded as a reduction in paid-in capital. 
  At its election, the Company can exercise the purchased call option on a cash basis, share basis or a net share basis.  Upon exercise, the net value of the consideration is identical and can range from   zero   to approximately   $40.0 million  , depending upon the market price per share of the Company s common stock at the time.  In the event there is an early unwind of one or more components of the Call Spread, the amount of cash to be received by the Company will depend upon the Company s market price of the Company s common stock and the remaining term of the Call Spread.  The number of shares and the strike prices are subject to customary adjustments.

           11. 
    Non-controlling Interests 
     Operating Partnership 
  Non-controlling interests include the aggregate LTIP Units held by limited partners (the  Unit Holders ) in the Operating Partnership.  Net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest is based on the weighted average Unit Holders  ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership for the respective period.  The issuance of additional common stock or LTIP Units changes the percentage ownership of both the Unit Holders and the Company.  Since an LTIP Unit is generally redeemable for cash or common stock at the option of the Company, it is deemed to be equivalent to common stock.  Therefore, such transactions are treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders  equity and non-controlling interests on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to account for the change in the ownership of the underlying equity in the Operating Partnership.  On a quarterly basis, the carrying value of such non-controlling interest is allocated based on the number of LTIP Units held by Unit Holders in total in proportion to the number of LTIP Units in total plus the number of shares of common stock.  In connection with the formation of the Operating Partnership, the Company recorded a non-controlling interest of   $4.4 million   related to LTIP Units.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   1,790,048   LTIP units were outstanding, representing a   1.0%   ownership and non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership.  Income attributable to the Operating Partnership non-controlling interest for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. 
  Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests 
  Townsend is a consolidated majority-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Certain members of Townsend management own interests in Townsend in the form of Class B units where the holders have the ability to require the Company to purchase a certain percentage of such units annually beginning December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2020 with settlement in: (i) cash; (ii) the Company s common stock; or (iii) a combination of cash and the Company s common stock, subject to certain conditions.  Such interest is considered redeemable non-controlling interest and net income (loss) attributable to such interest is based on the member s ownership percentage of Townsend for the respective period.

Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented.  The Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including the Company.  
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred   $5.7 million   of income tax expense and had a   $3.8 million   of income tax benefit, respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred   $9.3 million   and   $16.2 million   of income tax expense, respectively, which is based on a full year estimated effective tax rate of approximately   14.9%   and   14.0%  , respectively.  The Company operates internationally and domestically through multiple operating subsidiaries.  Each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates has its own tax law and tax rate and the tax rate outside the United States may be lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1.  Financial Statements  of this report.  References to  NSAM,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our  refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 
  Introduction 
  We are a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally.  We commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group  Inc. (NYSE:NSAM), a Delaware corporation, or the NSAM Spin-off.  The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty s common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.  At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by our affiliate through a management contract with an initial term of   20 years  .  NorthStar Realty continues to operate its commercial real estate, or CRE, debt origination business. 
  On October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the spin-off of its European real estate business, or the NRE Spin-off, into a separate publicly-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., or NorthStar Europe.  We manage NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as our management agreement with NorthStar Realty.  
  NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe are herein collectively referred to as our NorthStar Listed Companies. 
  We have a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital and through various vehicles that include REITs, closed-end funds and others that we may form in the future.  We earn various fees from managing this capital and we refer to this platform as our Retail Business.  Certain of our affiliates also manage NorthStar Realty s previously sponsored non-traded companies which raise capital through the retail market, as well as any new non-traded company and any future sponsored company that raises capital from retail investors, referred to as our Retail Companies and together with the NorthStar Listed Companies, referred to as our Managed Companies. 
  We are organized to provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, or any other companies we may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally.  Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry.  We seek to expand the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures. 
  On January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend Holdings LLC, or Townsend, or the Townsend Acquisition Date, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets.  Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to   $184 billion   of real assets as of   September 30, 2016  .  Townsend s management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations, subject to the oversight and direction of its board of directors which is controlled by NSAM.  We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately   $383 million  , net of post-closing adjustments.  In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a   $500 million   term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. 
  We earn asset management and other fees, directly or indirectly, pursuant to management and other contracts and direct investments.  In addition, we own NorthStar Securities, LLC, or NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which raises capital in the retail market for our Retail Companies. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted for sales, acquisitions and commitments to sell or acquire investments by our Managed Companies and Townsend, through   November 4, 2016  , we had   $39 billion   of assets under management.  In addition, inception to date, we invested $483 million in direct investments in entities that manage $26 billion, including assets held by our Managed Companies, across a variety of asset classes.  We may also make opportunistic investments that take advantage of market dynamics. 
  Merger Agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, we announced that we entered into a merger agreement with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform, or the Mergers.  The transaction has been approved by our and NorthStar Realty s respective boards of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective Special Committees and the board of directors of Colony.

     Table of Contents  

Under the terms of the merger agreement, as amended, we will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as a REIT beginning in 2017 and NorthStar Realty and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc.  Our common stockholders will receive one share of Colony NorthStar s common stock for each share of common stock they own.  Upon completion of the transaction, NorthStar Realty stockholders will own approximately   33.90%  , Colony stockholders will own approximately   33.25%   and our stockholders will own approximately   32.85%   of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, excluding the effect of certain equity-based awards issuable in connection with the Mergers.  Prior to the closing of the Mergers, we expect our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof to declare a special cash dividend in the amount of   $228 million   to our common stockholders. 
  In October 2016, we amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for our executive officers and a special cash dividend for our stockholders now totaling   $228 million  .  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, we entered into a voting agreement with MSD Capital L.P. or MSD and its affiliates, which together own approximately 10.2% of our outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals. In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of ours that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company following the completion of the Mergers, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement us, Colony and NorthStar Realty and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of NSAM s, Colony s and NorthStar Realty s respective stockholder approvals.

  Our Business  
  Our primary business objective is to provide asset management and other services by managing our NorthStar Listed Companies and our Retail Companies, both in the United States and internationally.  We earn asset management and other fees pursuant to management and other contracts and through our direct and indirect investments in strategic partnerships and joint ventures.  Our growth will depend upon the ability of our NorthStar Listed Companies and our Retail Companies to grow by raising capital, which in turn is driven by their investment activities and overall performance.  In addition, growth in our assets under management from our Retail Companies is impacted by the ability to raise capital in the retail market through NorthStar Securities.  Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry and have demonstrated the ability to invest and create value through multiple real estate cycles and changing market conditions.  We expanded the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate by creating and managing additional types of investment vehicles that we expect will appeal to a broader retail investor base. 
  As we grow our business and expand into new asset classes and geographies, we have entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to augment our business operations, while at the same time benefiting from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures, including our investment in AHI and Island and our acquisition of Townsend. 
  Our management team, located in the United States and internationally, has a proven track record in managing and growing our Managed Companies.  We believe our in-place, long-duration fees, substantial growth prospects and scalable operating platform

     Table of Contents  

position us as an industry leading asset manager.  We have the ability to maintain a competitive advantage through a combination of our deep industry relationships and access to market leading credit underwriting and capital markets expertise which enables us to manage credit risk, implement effective portfolio management strategies, as well as to structure and finance the assets of our Managed Companies efficiently.  Our ability to identify opportunities across a broad spectrum of potential investments for our Managed Companies will continue to create complementary and overlapping sources of investment opportunities based on a common reliance on market fundamentals and application of similar underwriting and asset management skills as we seek to maximize stockholder value. 
  Assets of our Managed Companies grew significantly over the past several years driven by our ability to raise capital for NorthStar Realty and our Retail Companies and in turn effectively deploy such capital.  In addition, our assets under management have increased due to our recent acquisition of Townsend.  Recently, our NorthStar Listed Companies have been constrained by their inability to access the capital markets due to current market conditions. 
  The following table presents the investments of our Managed Companies, Townsend and assets under management of our current and pending consolidated direct investments as of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted for sales, acquisitions and commitments to sell or acquire investments by our Managed Companies and Townsend through   November 4, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

     NorthStar Listed Companies 
  We provide asset management and other services on a fee basis to our NorthStar Listed Companies. 
             
    NorthStar Realty   - NorthStar Realty is a diversified commercial real estate company with 91% of its total assets invested directly or indirectly in real estate, including healthcare, hotel, manufactured housing, net lease, multifamily and multi-tenant office properties.  NorthStar Realty invests in multiple asset classes across CRE that it expects will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and may take the form of acquiring real estate, originating or acquiring senior or subordinate loans, as well as pursuing opportunistic CRE investments. 
                
    NorthStar Europe   - On October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the NRE Spin-off.  NorthStar Europe is a newly-formed European focused commercial real estate company with predominately prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  NorthStar Europe seeks to provide stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time. 
     Recently, our NorthStar Listed Companies have been constrained by their inability to access the capital markets. 
  Management Agreements 
  In connection with the NRE Spin-off, we entered into a management agreement with NorthStar Europe on terms substantially consistent with the terms of our management agreement with NorthStar Realty.  Our management agreement with NorthStar Realty was amended and restated in connection with the NRE Spin-off to, among other things, adjust the annual base management fee and incentive fee hurdles for the NRE Spin-off. 
  The management agreements with each of our NorthStar Listed Companies are for initial terms of 20 years, which automatically renew for additional 20-year terms each anniversary thereafter unless earlier terminated and provide for a base management fee and incentive fee. 
  The following table presents a summary of the fee arrangements and amounts earned from our NorthStar Listed Companies:

    The base management fee will increase by an amount equal to 1.5% per annum of the sum of: the cumulative net proceeds of all future common equity and preferred equity issued, equity issued in exchange or conversion of exchangeable senior notes or stock-settlable notes based on the stock price at the date of issuance and any other issuances of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe operating partnerships, which are structured as profits interests, or LTIP Units (excluding units issued to the parent company and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership) by our NorthStar Listed Companies and cumulative cash available for distribution, or CAD, of our NorthStar Listed Companies, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP units or other equity awards beginning the first full calendar quarter after the NSAM Spin-off and NRE Spin-off, respectively.  In addition, NorthStar Realty s equity interest in RXR Realty LLC, or RXR Realty, and Aerium Group is structured so that we are entitled to the portion of distributable cash flow from each investment in excess of the $10 million minimum annual base amount. 
              (2) 
    The incentive fee is calculated by the product of 15% or 25% and CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, when such amount is within a certain hurdle multiplied by the weighted average shares outstanding of our NorthStar Listed Companies for the calendar quarter.  Weighted average shares represent the number of shares of our NorthStar Listed Companies  common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis.

    If NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by us on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreements between us and our NorthStar Listed Companies, respectively.  The management agreements further provide that the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than the aggregate base management fee in place at NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe, as the case may be, immediately prior to such spin-off.  
                
    Our management agreements with NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe provide that in the event of a change of control or other event that could be deemed an assignment by us of the management agreement, NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe, respectively, will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent.  The management agreements further provide that NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe, respectively, anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management.  The management agreements also provide that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us, on the one hand, or NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement.  Upon completion of the Mergers, the management agreement with NorthStar Realty will cease to exist. 
     Payment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation 
  Our NorthStar Listed Companies are each responsible for all of their direct costs and expenses and will reimburse us for costs and expenses incurred by us on their behalf.  In addition, we may allocate indirect costs to our NorthStar Listed Companies related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our applicable NorthStar Listed Company s management agreements with us, or the G A Allocation.  Our management agreements with our NorthStar Listed Companies each provide that the amount of the G A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i) 20% of the combined total of: (a) our NorthStar Listed Companies  general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to us under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses from us to our NorthStar Listed Companies, or our NorthStar Listed Companies  G  and (b) our general and administrative expenses as reported in our consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any of our Managed Companies; less (ii) our NorthStar Listed Companies  G A.  The G A Allocation may include our applicable NorthStar Listed Company s allocable share of our compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing such NorthStar Listed Company s affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to such NorthStar Listed Company s affairs.  The G A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies  affairs.  In addition, each NorthStar Listed Company will pay directly or reimburse us for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between us and any of our executives, employees or other service providers.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not allocate costs to NorthStar Listed Companies.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , we allocated   $0.8 million   of costs to NorthStar Listed Companies.  Such amount is recorded net of general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

Following the NRE Spin-off, as provided in our management agreements with each NorthStar Listed Company, such NorthStar Listed Company s obligations to reimburse us for the G A Allocation and any severance are shared among our NorthStar Listed Companies, at our discretion, and the 20% cap on the G A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to our NorthStar Listed Companies.  We currently determined to allocate these amounts based on total investments. 
  Pursuant to the management agreements with NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe, NorthStar Realty together with NorthStar Europe and any company spun-off from NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Europe, are obligated to pay directly or reimburse us for up to 50% of any long-term bonus or other compensation that our compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to our executives, employees and service providers during any year.  In accordance with these agreements, NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe were responsible for paying 50% of the 2015 long-term bonuses earned under the NSAM Bonus Plan.

     Institutional Capital - Townsend 
  Townsend generated management, advisory and incentive fees of   $17.0 million   and   $46.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and from the Townsend Acquisition Date through   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  We were also entitled to   $1.8 million   of management and other fees from January 14, 2016 to the Townsend Acquisition Date, which was recorded net of operating expenses in other income. 
  Certain contracts contain provisions to reimburse Townsend for expenses incurred on behalf of its clients such as legal due diligence and investment advisory team travel expenses.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the period from the Townsend Acquisition Date through   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $0.6 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, in both other income and other expenses related to such reimbursements. 
   
  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows 
  We primarily generate revenue from asset management and other fee income pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Managed Companies and effective January 29, 2016, we began generating revenue from asset management and other fee income from Townsend.  We also generate revenue from commission income from selling equity in our Retail Companies.  Additionally, we record equity in earnings (losses) and receive distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures.  
   
  Profitability and Performance Metrics 
  We calculate certain metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business. 
             
    CAD is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance (refer to  Non-GAAP Financial Measure  for a description of this metric); and 
                
    Our ability to raise capital for our Managed Companies, which in turn grows the assets of our Managed Companies, is a driver of our ability to grow our fee income. 
                
    The ability of Townsend to expand its advisory client base and fund management business, which in turn grows our institutional assets under management, is a driver of our ability to grow our fee income. 
      
  Outlook and Recent Trends 
  We and the assets of our Managed Companies are impacted by global, domestic, regional and local market and economic conditions.  Historically, we have principally focused on domestic real estate investment platforms and companies.  Over time, we have expanded internationally and may in the future expand the breadth of our business beyond the real estate asset class which may be accelerated after the closing of the Mergers.  The interconnected nature of today s economy exposes our business to global markets and economic conditions and changes in these areas, although not directly related to our business, may have a significant impact. 
  The U.S. economy demonstrated improvement in 2015, which prompted the Federal Reserve in December 2015 to raise the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years.  The U.S. economy has continued to show strength throughout 2016 with approximately 5% unemployment and positive trends in the housing market.  Despite this, concerns still remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, oil price instability, slow U.S. GDP and global growth, the U.S. Presidential election and

     Table of Contents  

increasing international market volatility.  Many other global central banks have been easing monetary policy to combat low inflation and stagnant growth and the Federal Reserve is signaling that it may further adjust the Federal Funds Rate in 2016, especially in light of certain global events described below. 
  In June 2016, a non-binding referendum was passed in the United Kingdom supporting the exit from the European Union which in turn resulted in considerable instability to global markets and currencies, especially European markets, the U.K. s economy and the British Pound Sterling which has continued to devalue.  In addition, dramatic political change in the United Kingdom has resulted including the election of a new Prime Minister in July 2016.  Much uncertainty remains as to the process for a potential March 2017 start to  Brexit  and the long-term impacts to the global, European and British economies.  Sovereign banks have been actively easing monetary policy resulting in sustained low-to-negative interest rate environments, while several key global economies, including England, Germany and Japan, have recently reached positive interest rate territory in the benchmark 10-year paper.  The Bank of England and other central banks remain poised for further monetary and financial policy action should the U.K. s economy enter a downturn or as a tool to encourage positive economic growth.  Despite the unexpected result of the referendum, markets have generally continued to function properly and in some cases recovered from the initial shock (e.g., U.S. equity markets).  The potential for ongoing volatility and uncertainty resulting from  Brexit  and other geopolitical or financial unrest may have a significant impact on the overall global economic environment. 
  Given these influences and resulting market conditions at the end of 2015 and throughout 2016, our NorthStar Listed Companies have been constrained by their inability to access the capital markets.  Following the NSAM Spin-off, our assets under management grew substantially in part because of the significant capital raising activity at NorthStar Realty.  Sustained volatility in the capital markets has diminished our NorthStar Listed Companies  capital raising activity and this environment could continue for an extended period of time. 
  CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types.  Investor demand in 2015 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors.  Private capital investment remained aggressive throughout 2015 and, although public markets slowed at the beginning of 2016, continued to remain aggressive throughout 2016, leading to continued appreciation in real estate values.  However, property price appreciation has slowed and there is speculation that certain markets may be entering the late stage of the current real estate cycle and, in some markets, rent growth and capitalization rate compression has started to slow.  One of the factors that may contribute to periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market is the large amount of maturing commercial real estate debt that may have difficulties being refinanced.  Approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States is scheduled to mature through 2018.  While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity to satisfy many of these maturities, 2016 private-label CMBS year-to-date is 43% compared to the same period in 2015 and industry experts estimate a projected total origination volume of approximately $65 billion for 2016 versus volume of $95 billion in 2015.  Despite non-traditional lenders significantly increasing loan origination volumes, this trend is potentially one symptom that could point to broader difficulties in the ability of the market to refinance the large amount of maturing real estate debt and may lead to a negative impact on the overall real estate market. 
  As an active asset manager of capital raised in the retail market, historically focusing on the non-traded sector, we are continually monitoring retail market fundamentals and trends and use the non-traded REIT market as a proxy for our overall retail business.  Non-traded REIT capital raising was down year over year by 20% in 2014 (with approximately $16 billion in equity raised) and 36% in 2015.  We were able to gain market share with our non-traded REITs during this time, having a 7% market share in 2014 increasing to 13% in 2015.  In April 2016, the retail industry experienced the implementation of FINRA 15-02 related to disclosure on broker-dealer account statements and the final ruling of the U.S. Department of Labor s  fiduciary  standard for retirement accounts.  Although the final fiduciary rule was more favorable to both sponsors and broker-dealers in the retail industry than initial proposals, the impact of both of these events has been a sharp decline in capital raising in the retail market as evidenced by the overall non-traded REIT capital raising being down 55% year-to-date through September 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  We have seen our sales decline in 2016 as a result.  However, we anticipate the overall market and opportunity for retail products to improve as it adapts to these changes and we expect to continue to gain market share as our institutional-quality sponsorship, rapidly broadening product line and innovative structures create opportunities to differentiate our platform from other sponsors in the retail industry and access broader pools of capital than has historically been available to us.  We believe this opportunity will be enhanced once the Mergers have closed. 
  Due to our expertise, track record and industry relationships, we continue to see a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that have credit qualities and yield profiles that are consistent with our underwriting standards and that we believe offer the opportunity to meet or exceed our Managed Companies targeted risk/return profiles thereby increasing our assets under management and fee income.  We also believe the opportunity exists to accelerate our growth through accretive investments in third party asset managers.  Additionally, we will take advantage of opportunities to optimize the portfolios of our Managed Companies and seek to lock in value through opportunistic dispositions and/or selling minority interests in certain assets/portfolios while redeploying realized capital in accretive transactions.  While we remain optimistic that we will continue to be able to generate and capitalize on attractive acquisition and disposition opportunities and that such opportunities will be enhanced by the Mergers, there is no assurance that will be the case.

Financing Strategy    
  Our organizational documents do not limit our capacity to use leverage or the amount we may use.  Our financing objective is to manage our capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute our business strategies and in turn create value for stockholders.  We seek to access a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities, including repurchases of our common stock.  In November 2015, in connection with the Townsend acquisition, we simultaneously obtained a commitment for a $500 million term loan and entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement, both of which were used to fund the transaction and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.  Upon the closing of Townsend, we entered into the $500 million term loan and used the proceeds to repay the revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.  In connection with the term loan, we obtained corporate issuer and issue credit ratings from Standard   Poor s Rating Services, or S P, and Moody s Investor Service, or Moody s, of BBB- and Ba2, respectively.  We may, from time to time, use derivative instruments primarily to manage interest rate risk.  We do not intend to use derivatives to speculate.  
  Portfolio Management  
  Credit risk management is our ability to manage our investments and investments of our Managed Companies in a manner that preserves capital and income and minimizes losses that would decrease income.  Upon commencement of operations, we perform portfolio management on behalf of our Managed Companies.  We maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management and servicing team, regular management meetings and an exhaustive quarterly credit review process.  These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific credit issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis.  Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that such review will identify all issues within the portfolios of our Managed Companies due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses at our Managed Companies may also stem from investments that are not identified during these credit reviews.  We use many methods to actively manage the assets of our Managed Companies such as frequent re-underwriting, dialogue with borrowers/tenants/operators/partners and regular inspections of our Managed Companies  collateral, modification to debt terms, taking title to collateral or selling assets when we can obtain a price that is attractive relative to its risk.  In addition, we seek to utilize services of certain strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to assist our portfolio management of our Managed Companies.  The portfolio management team, under the direction of the Investment Committee, uses many methods to actively manage our asset base to preserve our income and capital. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc., NorthStar Asset Management Group Limited Partnership, or our Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries.  We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. 
  We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests.  We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.

     Table of Contents  

We evaluate our Managed Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which we are the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE.  We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote. 
  We perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method. 
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  We may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  We may record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow or may follow the practical expedient of the net asset value of the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is generally on a one quarter lag.  We will record the change from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss). 
  We may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment. 
  We review our investments in unconsolidated ventures for which we did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, we consider U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Business Combinations 
  The Company accounts for purchases of assets that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method where the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair value.  The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill.  Such valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets including, but not limited to, customer relationships, acquired technology and trade names.  Management s estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates.  During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings.

     Table of Contents  

Intangible Assets 
  We record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as goodwill and other intangibles), based on estimated fair value.  Other intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is expected to be realized. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  We perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and evaluates the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  In making such assessment, qualitative factors are used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then an impairment loss is recorded. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Asset Management and Other Fees 
  Asset management and other fees include base and incentive fees earned from NorthStar Listed Companies, acquisition, disposition and other fees earned from the Retail Companies and fees earned from clients and limited partners of Townsend.  Asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned.  Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents.  Incentive fees that are subject to contingent repayment are not recognized as revenue until all related contingencies have been resolved. 
  Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by us for selling equity in our Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities.  Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis. 
  Fair Value Measurement 
  We follow fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for our financial instruments.  We categorize our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              (a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              (b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              (c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              (d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair  
     value measurement. 
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as our knowledge and experience of the market. 
  Securities 
  We elected to apply the fair value option for our securities investments.  Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.  Dividend income is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Equity-Based Compensation 
  We account for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award.  Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof.  For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date.  We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.  For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure.  We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method.  For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate.  We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis. 
  For awards with a combination of performance or market measures, we estimate the fair value as if it were two separate awards.  First, we estimate the probability of achieving the performance measure.  If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, we recognize the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above.  This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met.  If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, we record compensation expense based on the performance-based measure.  We would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense. 
  Equity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date.  The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any. 
  Foreign Currency  
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity. 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the spot currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction.  The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  We report consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in a separate statement following the consolidated statements of operations.  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI.  The component of OCI includes an adjustment for foreign currency translation. 
  Income Taxes 
  Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented.  On March 13, 2015, we restructured forming our Operating Partnership under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from us for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit holders.  The Operating Partnership is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including us.  For the period prior to March 13, 2015, we and our U.S. subsidiaries filed consolidated federal income tax returns.  Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.  Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted.  A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.

     Table of Contents  

In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  In the first quarter 2016, we adopted this guidance and, as a result, the fair value of our interest in real estate private equity funds sponsored by Townsend, or the Townsend Funds, of   $21.4 million   is not included in Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016  .  We did   no  t have any investments measured using net asset value as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We have concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

    The increase was driven by the growth in assets of our Retail Companies.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Retail Companies held total investments of   $7.0 billion   and   $5.7 billion  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    The decrease was due to less investment activity of our Retail Companies for the third quarter   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , with investment activity of $26.5 million at NorthStar Income and $463.5 million at NorthStar Income II.

    We began earning fees on the Townsend Acquisition Date. 
     Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees 
  We earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Retail Companies. 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities.  Our Retail Companies offer various share class structures which have a range of selling commissions and dealer manager fees: 
             
    Class A shares: selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class T shares: selling commissions of up to 2% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 2.75% of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class D shares: no selling commissions and dealer manager fees of up to   2%   of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class I Shares: no selling commissions or dealer manager fees. 
     All or a portion of the dealer manager fees may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities. 
  Certain of our Retail Companies  share classes, and currently the T share class, may include a trail commission commonly described as a distribution fee that are paid over time, of up to 1% per annum, to our dealer manager of which all or a portion may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers for ongoing investor services. 
  We continue to observe the market and may modify existing share classes or introduce a new share class to our Retail Companies in the future. 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees decreased for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mostly due to: (i) lower capital raising activity as NorthStar Healthcare completed its follow-on offering in January 2016 and lower capital raising activity of NorthStar Income II; and (ii) raising capital from the sale of Class T shares which has lower selling commissions and dealer manager fee than Class A shares. 
  The following table presents equity raised by our Retail Companies for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

           (1) 
    Includes capital raised through distribution reinvestment plans of   $36.4 million   and $29.0 million for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. 
              (2) 
    NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016.  Equity raised for the third quarter 2016 represents proceeds from NorthStar Healthcare s distribution reinvestment plan for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. 
              (3) 
    For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we raised gross offering proceeds of $21.9 million from the sale of Class A shares, $32.7 million from the sale of Class T shares and $8.4 million from shares issued as part of distribution reinvestment plans.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , we raised gross offering proceeds of $114.5 million from the sale of Class A shares and $5.7 million from shares issued as part of distribution reinvestment plans. 
              (4) 
    In December 2015, NorthStar Realty and RXR Realty satisfied NorthStar/RXR New York Metro s minimum offering amount and began raising capital during the second quarter 2016.  We expect the capital raise to accelerate in the short-term. 
     Other Income 
  Other income includes   $1.1 million   of dividend income earned from common stock owned in NorthStar Listed Companies and   $0.6 million   of reimbursable expenses related to Townsend. 
  Expenses 
  Commission Expense 
  Commission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom we have selling agreements to raise capital for our Retail Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid   $0.6 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees.

manager fees decreased for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mostly due to: (i) lower capital raising activity as NorthStar Healthcare completed its follow-on offering in January 2016 and lower capital raising activity of NorthStar Income II; and (ii) raising capital from the sale of Class T shares which has lower selling commissions and dealer manager fee than Class A shares.

Asset Management and Other Fees 
  The following table presents asset management and other fees earned from our Managed Companies and Townsend (dollars in thousands):

            (2) 
    The increase was driven by the growth in assets of our Retail Companies.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Retail Companies held total investments of   $7.0 billion   and   $5.7 billion  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    The decrease was due to less investment activity of our Retail Companies for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , with investment activity of $624.4 million at NorthStar Healthcare, $331.1 million at NorthStar Income and $643.6 million at NorthStar Income II. 
              (4) 
    The increase was driven by repayments of debt investments at our Retail Companies for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
              (5) 
    We began earning fees on the Townsend Acquisition Date.  We were also entitled to   $1.8 million   of management and other fees from January 14, 2016 to the Townsend Acquisition Date, which was recorded net of operating expenses in other income. 
     Selling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees 
  We earn net commission income through NorthStar Securities for selling equity in our Retail Companies. 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees represent fees earned for selling equity in our Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities.  Our Retail Companies offer various share class structures which have a range of selling commissions and dealer manager fees: 
             
    Class A shares: selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class T shares: selling commissions of up to 2% of gross offering proceeds raised and dealer manager fee of up to 2.75% of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class D shares: no selling commissions and dealer manager fees of up to   2%   of gross offering proceeds raised. 
                
    Class I Shares: no selling commissions or dealer manager fees. 
     All or a portion of the dealer manager fees may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers and paid to certain employees of NorthStar Securities. 
  Certain of our Retail Companies  share classes, and currently the T share class, may include a trail commission commonly described as a distribution fee that are paid over time, of up to 1% per annum, to our dealer manager of which all or a portion may be reallowed to participating broker-dealers for ongoing investor services. 
  We continue to observe the market and may modify existing share classes or introduce a new share class to our Retail Companies in the future. 
  Selling commission and dealer manager fees decreased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mostly due to: (i) lower capital raising activity as NorthStar Healthcare completed its follow-on offering in January 2016 and lower capital raising activity of NorthStar Income II; and (ii) raising capital from the sale of Class T shares which has lower selling commissions and dealer manager fee than Class A shares.

              (2) 
    NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016.  Equity raised for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily represents proceeds from NorthStar Healthcare s distribution reinvestment plan for which NorthStar Securities did not earn commission income. 
              (3) 
    For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we raised gross offering proceeds of $93.4 million from the sale of Class A shares, $118.9 million from the sale of Class T shares and $23.5 million from shares issued as part of distribution reinvestment plans.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we raised gross offering proceeds of $451.5 million from the sale of Class A shares and $12.6 million from shares issued as part of distribution reinvestment plans. 
              (4) 
    NorthStar/RXR New York Metro s amended registration statement to offer an additional class of common shares was declared effective by the SEC and the minimum offering amount has been satisfied.  We expect the capital raise to accelerate in the short-term. 
              (5) 
    NorthStar Corporate Fund and NorthStar Capital Fund s registration statements were declared effective by the SEC and the minimum offering amount has been satisfied.  We expect NorthStar Corporate Fund and NorthStar Capital Fund to begin raising capital from third parties in the first half 2017. 
     Other Income 
  Other income includes   $3.3 million   of dividend income earned from common stock owned in NorthStar Listed Companies, $3.5 million of gross management and other fees that we were entitled to from January 14, 2016 to the Townsend Acquisition Date, which is recorded net of operating expenses of   $1.8 million   and   $1.6 million   of reimbursable expenses related to Townsend. 
  Expenses

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid   $2.2 million   and   $9.8 million  , respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees.  Selling commission and dealer manager fees decreased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   mostly due to: (i) lower capital raising activity as NorthStar Healthcare completed its follow-on offering in January 2016 and lower capital raising activity of NorthStar Income II; and (ii) raising capital from the sale of Class T shares which has lower selling commissions and dealer manager fee than Class A shares.

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , transaction costs of   $32.1 million   primarily related to the Mergers in our corporate segment and the Townsend acquisition in our direct investments segment.

In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs of   $24.0 million   to our Retail Companies and   $0.5 million   to our NorthStar Listed Companies for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  General and administrative expenses   increased     $23.9 million   primarily attributable to the following:

     Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
  The change for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to the distribution of earnings between tax jurisdictions, interest expense on the Term Loan and additional deductions related to the acquisition of Townsend. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our capital sources may include cash flow provided from operating activities, primarily from management and other fee income paid to us from our Managed Companies and Townsend, as well as borrowings and the issuance of common stock.  In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we have available under a revolving credit agreement with NorthStar Realty up to $250 million of financing to us subject to certain conditions (refer to Related Party Arrangements).  In January 2016, in connection with the Townsend acquisition, we entered into a $500 million term loan and used the proceeds to fund the transaction, repay the revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes.  In connection with the term loan, we obtained corporate issuer and issue credit ratings from S P and Moody s of BBB- and Ba2, respectively.  Our primary uses of liquidity include operating expenses, dividends, acquisitions of direct investments and repurchase of our common stock.  On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, availability of existing cash balances, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects.  Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend. 
  In addition, in April 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $400 million   of our outstanding common stock.  In May 2016, our board of directors extended the authorization for an additional year.  The authorization expires in April 2017, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.  From April 2015 through   December 31, 2015  , we repurchased $7.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately   $105.2 million  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
  We expect that our cash flow from operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a receivable primarily from our Managed Companies and Townsend of   $110 million  , of which we received   $60 million   subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . 
  We currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs.  Unrestricted cash as of   November 4, 2016  , was approximately $106 million, including $16 million in the United States and $90 million outside the United States.

Cash Flows 
  The following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   September 30, 2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $84 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $128 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction costs related to the Mergers and acquisition of Townsend and less acquisition fees from the Retail Companies, partially offset by more asset management fees from the Retail Companies and operating income from the acquisition of Townsend. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $380 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $31 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due to the acquisition of Townsend in January 2016. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $297 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $77 million   used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Cash flow provided from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was due to entering into the Term Loan, partially offset by the repayment of the credit facility of $100 million,   $57 million   for the payment of dividends,   $8 million   net cash payment on repurchase of shares related to equity-based awards and tax withholding and   $4 million   for the distributions to redeemable non-controlling interests.  Cash flow used for financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was due to   $13 million   net cash payment on repurchase of shares related equity-based awards and tax withholding and   $59 million   for the payment of dividends. 
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we continue to be subject to the material contractual obligations and commitments referred to in our annual report Form 10-K for the   year ended     December 31, 2015  , with the exception of the corporate Term Loan entered into in January 2016 and unfunded commitments to co-invest approximately   1%   of the total unfunded commitment in the Townsend Funds, both in connection with the acquisition of Townsend.  Refer to Note 5.  Borrowings  in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a further discussion. 
  We entered into fee arrangements with service providers and advisors pursuant to which certain fees incurred by us in connection with the Mergers will become payable only if we consummate the Mergers.  We have and will incur other professional fees related to the Mergers.  In addition, we will incur cash compensation expenses to executives and employees related to severance, retention and related costs.  There can be no assurances that we will complete this or any other transaction.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and since the announcement of the Mergers through   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an aggregate of   $7 million   and   $24 million  , respectively, in transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  To the extent the Mergers are consummated, the Company anticipates incurring a significant amount of additional costs, which with respect to advisors could be up to approximately   $30 million  . 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have certain arrangements which do not meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements, but do have some of the characteristics of off-balance sheet arrangements such as certain of our investments in asset management businesses.  Refer to Note 4.      Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures  in Item 1.   Financial Statements  for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements.  Our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.

  In January 2014, we entered into a long-term strategic partnership with James F.

Island provides certain asset management, property management and other services to NorthStar Realty to assist in managing its hotel properties.  Island receives a base management fee of 2.5% to 3.0% of the current monthly revenue of the NorthStar Realty hotel properties it manages for NorthStar Realty.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , NorthStar Realty incurred   $5 million   of base property management and other fees to Island in each period.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the period from acquisition date (January 9, 2015) through   September 30, 2015  , NorthStar Realty incurred   $14   million and   $11 million  , respectively, of base property management and other fees to Island. 
  RXR Realty 
  In December 2013, NorthStar Realty entered into a strategic transaction with RXR Realty, the co-sponsor of NorthStar/RXR New York Metro.  The investment in RXR Realty includes an approximate 27% equity interest.  NorthStar Realty s equity interest in RXR Realty is structured so that we are entitled to the portion of distributable cash flow from RXR Realty s investment management business in excess of the $10 million minimum annual base amount set forth in the management agreement (refer to Note 3).  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we were not entitled to any excess. 
   
  Recent Developments 
  Dividends 
  On   November 1, 2016  , the Company declared a dividend of   $0.10   per share of common stock.  The common stock dividend will be paid on   November 18, 2016   to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 14, 2016  . 
  Colony NorthStar Registration Statement 
  In October 2016, we amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for our executive officers and a special cash dividend for our stockholders now totaling   $228 million  .  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, we entered into a voting agreement with MSD and its affiliates, which together own approximately 10.2% of our outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals.  In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of ours that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company following the completion of the Mergers, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement us, Colony and NorthStar Realty and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
  We believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance.  Management also uses CAD, among other measures, to evaluate profitability.  In addition, the incentive fees to which we are entitled pursuant to our management agreements with each of our NorthStar Listed Companies are determined using such NorthStar Listed Company s CAD as a performance metric.  We believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other, realized gain (loss) on investments and other and asset impairment).  We adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance.  For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments or restructuring of investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions. 
  We calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests attributable to the Operating Partnership and the following items: equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization related items, amortization of deferred financing costs, foreign currency gains (losses), impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, straight-line rent, adjustments for joint ventures and investment funds, unrealized (gain) loss from fair value adjustments, realized gain (loss) on investments and transaction and other costs.  In future periods, such adjustments may include other one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items.  These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.  Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. 
  CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Includes an adjustment to add $1.0 million of equity-based compensation expense, $2.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense related to unconsolidated ventures and a reduction of $0.2 million related to net unrealized and realized gains (losses) on the Townsend Funds. 
              (2) 
    Represents the change in fair value for our investment in NorthStar Listed Companies common stock and foreign exchange gains (losses). 
              (3) 
    Includes an adjustment to add back transaction costs of which   $6.7 million   related to the Mergers.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk is primarily related to our role providing asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, including asset management services provided by Townsend, both in the United States and internationally, and its effect on the asset management and other fees we earn.  Our exposure to market risk will increase as we expand into new asset classes and geographies, and as a result, we will seek to enter into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to augment our business operations while at the same time benefiting from the fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures.  Our asset management and other fees are primarily driven by the ability of our Managed Companies to grow by raising capital, which will in turn be driven by their investment activities, overall performance and various factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions and political considerations.  The effect of such risks on our asset management and other fee agreements vary based on the management contract with the respective Managed Company. 
  Our NorthStar Listed Companies  management agreements consist of a base management fee which increases as equity is raised and an incentive fee which is based on the performance of our NorthStar Listed Companies using CAD as an operating metric.  The base management fee currently represents the majority of the fee.  The ability of our NorthStar Listed Companies to grow is dependent on access to the capital markets to raise equity and/or debt capital.  To the extent that general capital markets activity slows down or comes to a halt (as is currently the case), our NorthStar Listed Companies may have difficulty growing.  This risk is based on micro and macro-economic market factors including but not limited to disruptions in the equity and debt capital markets and institutional lending market, including the lack of access to capital or prohibitively high costs of obtaining or replacing capital.  Despite improvements in 2015, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge.  Recent volatility in the equity markets may diminish our NorthStar Listed Companies  capital raising activity. 
  NorthStar Securities ability to sell equity in our Retail Companies is highly dependent upon the market and the efforts of our broker-dealer.  The retail business has experienced rapid growth, is highly competitive and has faced increased scrutiny in recent years.  The number of entrants in the retail market space has grown significantly over the last several years and as a result, we are subject to significant competition from these and other companies seeking to raise capital in this market.  Additionally, as a result of increased scrutiny and accompanying media attention and a rapidly changing regulatory environment, our retail businesses may face increased difficulties in raising capital in their offerings due to market perception.  These factors may affect our ability to raise capital for our retail businesses and make investments on their behalf, both of which could materially adversely affect our asset management and other fee income and the net commission income generated by our broker-dealer. 
  To a lesser extent, we are indirectly exposed to credit risk through the performance of our Managed Companies and direct investments.  Credit risk relates to the ability of our Managed Companies to operate successfully as well as the individual investments to perform, for instance the ability for the borrowers  underlying debt or securities investments to make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates.  We seek to manage credit risk through a comprehensive credit analysis prior to making an investment, actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification of our portfolio.  Our analysis is based on a broad range of real estate, financial, economic and borrower-related factors which we believe are critical to the evaluation of credit risk inherent in a transaction. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk relates to the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.  Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.  Fluctuations in LIBOR may affect the amount of interest expense we incur on our term loan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in three-month LIBOR would result in a decrease in net income of approximately $5 million annually. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are subject to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.  As a result, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. dollars).  We may use several strategies to mitigate our exposure through a combination of foreign currency derivative instruments and use non-U.S. denominated borrowings, where appropriate. 
  Non-U.S. Operations 
  We conduct business internationally, with a current focus on Europe.  We currently have foreign offices in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Bermuda and Hong Kong.  We are subject to various risks, including, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, tax laws and policies, expropriation, nationalization, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership.  As we continue to expand internationally, we will continue to focus on monitoring and managing these risk factors as they relate to specific international investments.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management conducted an evaluation as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). 
  Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 
  Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
  Except as set forth below, there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
  The Company acquired Townsend Holdings LLC during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and therefore, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of certain controls and procedures does not include such acquisition.  This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition.

  I, Albert Tylis, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the  period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
