          BIOMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES     NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)          Note 1: Basis of Presentation          The information set forth in these condensed consolidated statements is unaudited and reflects all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the consolidated results of operations of Biomerica, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively the  Company ), for the periods indicated. It does not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments that were made are of a normal recurring nature.         The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes are presented as permitted by the requirements for Form 10-Q and do not contain certain information included in our annual financial statements and notes. The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of May 31, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved for our full fiscal year.          Note 2:     Significant Accounting Policies           Principles of Consolidation          The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Biomerica, Inc. as well as its German subsidiary and Mexican subsidiary. The Mexican subsidiary has not begun operations. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.           Accounting Estimates          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.          Cash and Cash Equivalents          Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months.          Accounts Receivable          The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers on a regular basis.  International accounts are required to prepay until they establish a history with the Company and at that time, they are extended credit at levels based on a number of criteria.  Credit levels are approved by designated upper level management. Domestic customers are extended initial credit limits until they establish a history with the Company or submit credit information. All increases in credit limits are also approved by designated upper level management. Management evaluates receivables on a quarterly basis and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly. Balances over ninety days old are usually reserved for unless collection is reasonably assured. Management evaluates quarterly what items to charge off.           Occasionally certain long-standing customers, who routinely place large orders, may have unusually large receivables balances relative to the total gross receivables. Management monitors the payments for these large balances closely and very often requires payment of existing invoices before shipping new sales orders.            Inventories          The Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using a combination of specific lot identification and the first-in, first-out methods) or market. Management periodically reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence. Management evaluates quantities on hand, physical condition, and technical functionality as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer demand for current products and new product introductions. The reserve is adjusted based on such evaluation, with a corresponding provision included in cost of sales. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material are recognized as current period charges and the allocation of fixed production overhead is based on the normal capacity of the Company s production facilities.        5         
 
       Inventories approximate the following at:          
       Reserves for inventory obsolescence are reduced as necessary to reduce obsolete inventory to estimated realizable value or to specifically reserve for obsolete inventory that the Company intends to dispose of. As of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016 inventory reserves were approximately $42,000 and $52,000, respectively.          Property and Equipment, net          Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions and major improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts, and gains or losses from retirements and dispositions are credited or charged to income.          Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 5 to 10 years, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment and leasehold improvements amounted to $36,971 and $40,151 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.              Intangible Assets, net          Intangible assets include trademarks, product rights, licenses, technology rights and patents, and are accounted for based on Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ). In that regard, intangible assets   that have indefinite  useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life; not to exceed 18 years for marketing and distribution rights, 10 years for purchased technology use rights, licenses, and 17 years for patents. Amortization amounted to $16,007 and $18,723 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.          Share-Based Compensation          The Company follows the guidance of the accounting provisions of ASC 718, Share-based Compensation ( ASC 718 ), which requires the use of the fair-value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (options). The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected forfeiture rate, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate.          Expected volatilities are based on weighted averages of the historical volatility of the Company s stock and other factors estimated over the expected term of the options. The expected forfeiture rate is based on historical forfeitures experienced. The expected term of options granted is derived using the  simplified method  which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term as historically the Company had limited activity surrounding its options. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the period of the expected term.        6         
 
           The following summary presents the options and warrants granted, exercised, expired, cancelled and outstanding as of August 31, 2016:          
                      In the quarter ended August 31, 2016 options to acquire 55,000 shares of the Company s common stock were granted at exercise prices ranging from $1.52 to $1.61 per share.            Revenue Recognition          Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped, customarily FOB shipping point, at which point title passes. An allowance is established when necessary for estimated returns as revenue is recognized. In conjunction with sales to certain customers, the Company provides free products upon attaining certain levels of purchases by the customer. The Company accounts for these free products in accordance with ASC 605-50, Revenue Recognition   Customer Payments and Incentives and recognizes the cost of the product as part of cost of sales.          Investments          From time-to-time, the Company makes investments in privately-held companies. The Company determines whether the fair values of any investments in privately-held entities have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. If the Company considers any such decline to be other than temporary (based on various factors, including historical financial results, and the overall health of the investee s industry), a write-down to estimated fair value is recorded.  The Company currently has not written down the investment and no events have occurred which could indicate the carrying value to be less than the fair value. Investments represent the Company s investment in a Polish distributor which is primarily engaged in distributing medical devices. The Company owns approximately 6% of the investee, and accordingly, applies the cost method to account for the investment. Under the cost method, investments are recorded at cost, with gains and losses recognized as of the sale date, and income recorded when received.          Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs          Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified as net sales and shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales. The Company included shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. The Company included shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight and unreimbursed shipping to customers in cost of sales.          Research and Development          Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.          Income Taxes                  The Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $1,043,000 and $1,038,000 as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively.             Foreign Currency Translation          The subsidiary located in Germany is accounted for primarily using local functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The subsidiary in Mexico, although not operating, has two bank accounts which according to exchange rates in effect at the end of each period need to be adjusted for that fluctuation. The resulting adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.        7         
 
            Deferred Rent          Incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred lease incentives and are amortized over the underlying lease term on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense. When the terms of an operating lease provide for periods of free rent, rent concessions, and/or rent escalations, the Company establishes a deferred rent liability for the difference between the scheduled rent payment and the straight-line rent expense recognized. This deferred rent liability is amortized over the underlying lease term on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense.          Net Loss Per Share          Basic loss per share are computed as net loss or income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options using the treasury stock method. The total amount of anti-dilutive warrants or options not included in the earnings per share calculation for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was 1,249,000 and 1,109,852 respectively.         The following table illustrates the required disclosure of the reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:          
        New Accounting Pronouncements                   In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-04, Liabilities (Topic 405): Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date ( ASU 2013-04 ). The amendments in ASU 2013-04 provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this update is fixed at the reporting date, except for obligations addressed within existing guidance in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The guidance requires an entity to measure those obligations as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance in this update also requires an entity to disclose the nature and amount of the obligation as well as other information about those obligations. The amendments in this standard are effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, which corresponds to the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2015. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.                     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting, ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted.  Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. During August 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of the above mentioned revenue recognition guidance by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.        8         
 
                 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU-2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of ASU 2015-11 at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in general accepted accounting principles of the United States of America with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016. Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.               On November 20, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU-2015-17 ) . The update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities on a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company chose to adopt ASU 2015-17 as of the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2015.               On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU-2016-01 ).  The release affects public and private companies that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. ASU-2016-01 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU- 2016-01 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.               On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU-2016-02 ) . ASU-2016-02 defines whether a contract is a lease. If it is a lease, the Company is required to recognize the lease assets and liabilities. ASU-2016-02 is effective for public companies for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is evaluating the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU-2016-02 will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations.               On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The update includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for share-based compensation. ASU-2016-09 will take effect for public companies for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.

           OVERVIEW         Biomerica, Inc. and Subsidiaries ("Biomerica", the "Company", "we" or "our") develops, manufactures, and markets medical diagnostic products designed for the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases and medical conditions. Our medical diagnostic products are sold worldwide in two markets: 1) clinical laboratories and 2) point of care (physicians' offices and over-the-counter drugstores). Our diagnostic test kits are used to analyze blood or urine from patients in the diagnosis of various diseases and other medical complications, or to measure the level of specific hormones, antibodies, antigens or other substances, which may exist in the human body in extremely small concentrations.                We primarily focus on products for gastrointestinal, food intolerances, diabetes and esoteric tests. These diagnostic test products utilize immunoassay technology. Some of these products have not yet been submitted for clearance by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )or each country s equivalent for diagnostic use, but can still be sold in various foreign countries without this approval.          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS               Consolidated net sales for Biomerica were $1,410,110 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $1,286,993 for the same period in the previous year. This represents an increase of $123,117, or 9.6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of sales in Asia of approximately $142,000 and in the U.S. of $39,000 which was offset by a decrease of approximately $65,000 in Europe.                       For the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to August 31, 2015, cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales from 67.3% of sales, or $865,572, to 59.1% of sales, or $833,148. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased due to the higher volume of sales which contributed more towards covering fixed expenses in addition to lower material costs for products and mix of products sold.               For the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to 2015, selling, general and administrative costs increased by $78,688, or 23.2%. This was primarily due to a one-time Nasdaq entry fee of $45,000 and to higher legal fees and outside services.               For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, research and development expenses were $224,246 as compared to $157,994, an increase of $66,252, or 41.9%. The increase was due to higher costs (materials, regulatory and wages) incurred in the development and approval of new products in the gastroenterology area.               For the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to August 31, 2015, dividend and interest income increased from $3,934 to $10,215.          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES                 As of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $1,817,019 and $1,888,925 and working capital of $4,323,758 and $4,329,041, respectively.                During the three months ended August 31, 2016 the Company s operations used cash of $71,932   compared to cash used in operations of $195,643 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Cash used by operations in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $62,807 and an increase in prepaids and other assets of $21,650 as compared to fiscal 2016 which had increased accounts receivables of $87,835 and an increase in inventories of $81,710. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 was $0 compared to fiscal 2016 of $5,680.  Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $0 compared to $6,624 in fiscal 2016, primarily a result of the exercise of stock options.           Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   None.              CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES          The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions.        11         
 
           We believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us.These relate to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory overhead application, and inventory reserve. We believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could be a material impact on our future financial conditions or results of operations. We suggest that our significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Please refer to Note 2 for information on Significant Accounting Policies.          Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.                 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.          Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES          Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the "reasonable assurance" level. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.                There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.          PART II. OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.     None.          Item 1A. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.          You should read the following factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. The following is intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of Biomerica, Inc. and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies such as Biomerica, Inc. Like other businesses, Biomerica, Inc. is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad, as were experienced in recent history that may affect the general economic climate and performance of Biomerica, Inc. or its customers.         Aside from general macroeconomic downturns, the additional material factors that could affect future financial results include, but are not limited to: Terrorist attacks and the impact of such events; diminished access to raw materials that directly enter into our manufacturing process; shipping labor disruption or other major degradation of the ability to ship our products to end users; inability to successfully control our margins which are affected by many factors including competition and product mix; protracted shutdown of the U.S. border due to an escalation of terrorist or counter terrorist activity; any changes in our business relationships with international distributors or the economic climate they operate in; any event that has a material adverse impact on our foreign manufacturing operations may adversely affect our operations as a whole; failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability; possible costs or difficulty in complying with government regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulations or regulatory requirements; numerous competitors, some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do; potential claims and litigation brought by patients or medical professionals alleging harm caused by the use of or exposure to our products; quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors, including business and industry conditions; concentrations of sales with certain distributions could adversely affect the results of the Company if the Company were to lose the sales of that distributor and other factors beyond our control; high balances carried on accounts receivables from concentrated customers; and the costs of recalls, should such occasion arise. All these factors make it difficult to predict  operating results for any particular period.       12
