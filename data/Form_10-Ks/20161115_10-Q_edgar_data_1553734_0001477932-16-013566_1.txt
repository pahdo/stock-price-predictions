Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements      March 31, 2016                NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS           Overview of Organization          International Metals Streaming Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on November 17, 2011, under the name "GS Valet, Inc." On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with Garden State Valet, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ("Garden State Valet"), and the unit-holders of Garden State Valet (the "Unit-holders") to purchase all of the outstanding units of Garden State Valet. Garden State Valet was formed on June 15, 2011.        Change in Control          On August 9, 2013, six accredited investors (the "Purchasers") acquired 12,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock in the aggregate then held by its former sole officer and director who, prior to such acquisition, held approximately 77.22% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Immediately thereafter, the Company caused 4,093,746 shares of its common stock that one of the Purchasers purchased to be cancelled pursuant to a Cancellation Agreement that the Company entered into with such Purchaser on August 9, 2013. As a result, the former sole officer and director relinquished his control of the Company and resigned, and a new sole officer and director was appointed in his place.       In connection with the change of control transaction, effective September 26, 2013, the Company changed its name from "GS Valet, Inc." to "International Metals Streaming Corp."       Effective September 26, 2013, the Company's board of directors approved a change in its fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31. The Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2012 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection therewith.       Until October 1, 2013, the Company, through Garden State Valet, provided valet parking management services for hotels, restaurants, country clubs, retail centers and private events in New Jersey. The operations of Garden State Valet ceased on October 1, 2013. The Company then planned to pursue a metals streaming business by acquiring and managing precious metals streams, royalties and other similar interests. As of December 31, 2013, however, the Company had not entered into any definitive agreement in connection with such business. In March 2014, the Company determined that the metals streaming business was no longer desirable, and have ceased pursuing such business. As of March 31, 2016, the Company currently has nominal operations and minimal assets. As such, the Company is considered to be a shell company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.         NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulation of the Securities Exchange Commission, including Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments), which are in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the operating results for the respective periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures provided are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.            INTERNATIONAL METALS STREAMING CORP.      Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements      March 31, 2016        The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited condensed financial statements and explanatory notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 as disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for that year as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.       Significant accounting policies are as follows:        Use of Estimates          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Cash        The Company presently maintains any cash in an attorney trust account until such time that the Company establishes a bank account.        Loss Per Share          The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding.        Financial Instruments          ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments. The Company's unaudited condensed balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.        Recently Issued Standards          In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.            INTERNATIONAL METALS STREAMING CORP.      Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements      March 31, 2016        In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This is part of FASB's simplification initiative. The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.       In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments which allows entities to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts in the period adjustment is identified rather than retrospectively. In-period adjustments must be disclosed. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this ASU. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.       In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-15, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)." ASU 2015-15 provides guidance as to the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.        In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)." The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-14 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)." ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting for the valuation of all inventory not accounted for using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method by prescribing that inventory be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-14 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)." ASU 2015-05 provides guidance regarding the accounting for a customer's fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement; specifically about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, and if so, how to account for the software license. ASU 2015-05 is effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.            INTERNATIONAL METALS STREAMING CORP.      Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements      March 31, 2016         NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN          The Company's unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared using US GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had incurred net losses of $72,803 and $33,106 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $965,250 and $892,447, respectively. The Company has not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the sufficiency of its capital or obtaining additional capital to fund operating losses. If the Company requires or is unable to obtain additional capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.        NOTE 4 - NOTES PAYABLE, THIRD PARTY          On April 4, 2014, the Company issued a note payable to a third party in the amount of $57,039. The note was due and payable on April 4, 2015 and carries an interest rate of 8% per annum. A settlement agreement has been reached but not executed whereby, under certain conditions, the note would be paid at a significant discount. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, there is $9,076 and $7,951, respectively in accrued interest related to the note payable included in accrued expenses.        On April 2, 2015, the Company issued a note payable to a third party in the amount of $2,500. The note is due and payable on April 2, 2016 and carries an interest rate of 8% per annum.

From time to time, the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that it is adequately insured for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.        NOTE 6   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS          During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred consulting fees of $1,000 and $2,000 provided by its current officer and director.         NOTE 7   EQUITY           Preferred Stock          The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share ("Preferred Stock"). No Preferred Stock has been issued to date.            INTERNATIONAL METALS STREAMING CORP.      Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements      March 31, 2016         Common Stock          The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"). On October 7, 2013, the Company's board of directors approved a 2.5 for 1 forward stock-split of its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Stock Split"). The Stock Split affected all shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the record date of October 3, 2013, and each stockholder of one share of Common Stock as of such record date received 2.5 shares of Common Stock. The Stock Split did not affect the par value of the Common Stock. No fractional shares were issued. The Stock Split increased the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock from 5,400,035 to 13,500,092. These notes and the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements give retroactive effect to the Stock Split. The Company had 12,093,754 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       On August 9, 2013, the Company sold 1,406,338 shares of Common Stock (the "Initial Shares") at $4.266 per share to two accredited investors (the "Initial Investors"). The closing thereof occurred on August 9, 2013 with gross proceeds to the Company of $6 million in connection thereof, comprised of $1 million in cash and $5 million in promissory notes issued by Preciosa Streaming Company Inc., a Barbados company ("Preciosa"). Preciosa issued the promissory notes to the Initial Investors, who, in turn, assigned them to the Company at the Closing pursuant to a Note Assignment Agreement entered into by and between Company and each Initial Investor on August 9, 2013. Preciosa repaid these notes in full to the Company on September 20, 2013. Preciosa also reimbursed to the Company $28,263 in legal fees incurred by the Company. The cash proceeds from issuance of the Initial Shares were placed into a trust account maintained by the Company's counsel until such time that the Company could establish a bank account. However, on March 11, 2014, the proceeds, less the costs incurred in the pursuit of the metals streaming business, were returned to the investors.        On August 9, 2013, the Company caused 4,093,746 shares of Common Stock held by a stockholder to be cancelled pursuant to a Cancellation Agreement entered into by and between the Company and such stockholder on August 9, 2013. The Company recognized a loss of $164 on the cancellation of this stock.        On December 9, 2013, the Company sold 468,823 shares of Common Stock (with the Initial Shares, collectively the "Shares") at $4.266 per share to two accredited investors (with the Initial Investors, collectively the "Investors"). The closing thereof occurred on December 9, 2013, with gross proceeds to the Company of $2 million. The cash proceeds from issuance of these shares were placed into a trust account maintained by the Company's counsel until such time that the Company could establish a bank account. However, on March 11, 2014, the proceeds, less the costs incurred in the pursuit of the metals streaming business, were returned to the investors.        On December 9, 2013, the Company sold 1,533,166 shares of Common Stock at $0.0001 per share for gross proceeds of $153.        On March 10, 2014, due to its determination that the metals streaming business was no longer desirable, the Company and the Investors rescinded their transactions pertaining to the Shares. In connection with such rescission: (a) each Investor agreed to return that portion of the Shares issued to such Investor, (b) the Company agreed to return the proceeds from the sale of the Shares to the Investors, net of all payments therefrom by the Company as of the date of the rescission, and (c) the Company and the Investors each agreed to release all claims that each of them may have against the other.       On March 11, 2014, $7,389,184 of the $8 million proceeds from the sale of 1,875,161 shares of Common Stock, less costs of $610,816, was returned to the Investors. In connection therewith, the certificates representing such shares have been surrendered to the Company for cancellation.        On November 5, 2015, two shareholders surrendered an aggregate of 1,533,166 shares of Common Stock to the Company and cancelled for no consideration.         NOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       On September 22, 2016, the former sole officer and director surrendered an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares of Common Stock to the Company which were cancelled. Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company was able to secure release of obligations for accrued expenses in the amount of $7,500 from a former sole officer and director and $108,688 in notes payable and accrued interest. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date these unaudited condensed financial statements were available to be issued as of November 8, 2016 and determined that there are no reportable subsequent events.            ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.           The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our condensed results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position for the three months ended March 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the information filed as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 30, 2016. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.           Forward-Looking Statements          Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, statements related to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitation the following: (i) our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at our discretion; (ii) our plans and results of operations will be affected by our ability to manage growth and competition; and (iii) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the SEC.          In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ''may,'' ''will,'' ''should,'' ''could,'' ''expects,'' ''plans,'' ''intends,'' ''anticipates,'' ''believes,'' ''estimates,'' ''predicts,'' ''potential,'' or ''continue'' or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report.           Overview          International Metals Streaming Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on November 17, 2011, under the name "GS Valet, Inc." On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with Garden State Valet, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ("Garden State Valet"), and the unit-holders of Garden State Valet (the "Unit-holders") to purchase all of the outstanding units of Garden State Valet. Garden State Valet was formed on June 15, 2011.          The Company, through Garden State Valet, provided valet parking management services for hotels, restaurants, country clubs, retail centers and private events in New Jersey. The operations of Garden State Valet ceased on October 1, 2013. The Company then planned to pursue a metals streaming business by acquiring and managing precious metals streams, royalties and other similar interests. As of December 31, 2014, however, the Company determined that the metals streaming business was no longer desirable, and have ceased pursuing such business. As of March 31, 2016, the Company currently has nominal operations and minimal assets. As such, the Company is considered to be a shell company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").               Results of Operations               Revenue          For the three ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any revenues from operations.           General and Administrative Expenses           For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, our general and administrative expenses totaled $71,566 and $31,981, respectively. This expense is primarily related to professional fees and consulting expenses incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.           Net Loss           For the three months ended March 31, 2016, our net loss was $72,803, or $(0.01) per common share (basic and diluted), as compared to a net loss of $33,106, or $(0.00) per common share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2015, an increase in total net loss of $39,697. Such increase in net losses was directly attributable to increased professional fees.               Liquidity and Capital Resources          In summary, our cash flows are as follows:                            For the three months ended March 31,                           2016                    2015                          (Unaudited)                  (Unaudited)                               Net cash used in operating activities            $  -            $  (1,600  )                                                     Net cash provided by investing activities            $  -            $  -                               Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities            $  -            $  -             As of March 31, 2016, the Company had a stockholders' deficit of $303,069. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of $72,803 and $33,106, respectively.        There was no net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities for the same period of 2015 was $1,600 and was mainly due to payments made for operating expenses.          There was no cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.          There was no cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.          As of March 31, 2016, the Company had $475 in cash, total current assets of $475 and total current liabilities of $303,544.           Going Concern          The Company's unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had incurred net losses of $72,803 and $33,106 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $303,069 and $230,266, respectively. The Company has not established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the sufficiency of its capital or obtaining additional capital to fund operating losses. If the Company requires or is unable to obtain additional capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.               Off-balance Sheet Arrangements          We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2016.           Contractual Obligations          We had no contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016.           Critical Accounting Policies          Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.          We believe that given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our unaudited condensed results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Please refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements.           Recently Issued Standards          In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This is part of FASB's simplification initiative. The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.       In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments which allows entities to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts in the period adjustment is identified rather than retrospectively. In-period adjustments must be disclosed. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this ASU. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.           In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-15, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)." ASU 2015-15 provides guidance as to the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.         In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606)." The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-14 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows         In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)." ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting for the valuation of all inventory not accounted for using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method by prescribing that inventory be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-14 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows         In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)." ASU 2015-05 provides guidance regarding the accounting for a customer's fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement; specifically about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, and if so, how to account for the software license. ASU 2015-05 is effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.         In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments are to be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.                There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.           ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.          As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.          ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.           Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures          Our sole officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.          Based on the evaluation as of March 31, 2016, for the reasons set forth below, our sole officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.          A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, our sole officer concluded our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as we lack resources to support full compliance.           Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting          There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.               PART II   OTHER INFORMATION           ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.          From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.           ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.          As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.           ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.          None.           ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.          None.           ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.          Not applicable.           ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.          None.              ITEM 6. EXHIBITS.

I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of International Metals Streaming Corp.;                2.
