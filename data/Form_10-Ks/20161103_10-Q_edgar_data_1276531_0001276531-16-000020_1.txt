SCIENTIFIC ENERGY, INC.  
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying financial statements follows: 
   
   Basis and Business Presentation   
   
 Scientific Energy, Inc., (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on May 30, 2001.  Prior to August 2011, the Company was principally devoted to the buying and selling of various types and grades of graphite, such as medium- and high-carbon graphite, high-purity graphite, micro-powder graphite and expandable graphite.   In August 2011, the Company decided to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. Currently the Company is in the process of developing a website, which provides an e-commerce platform, where registered members can exchange goods and services.  
   
 On February 28, 2012, the Company set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, Makeliving Ltd., which was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in order to engage in a business of e-commerce platform. 
   
 The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues since 2011 and is unlikely to generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. The management will seek to raise funds from shareholders. 
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has generated no revenues and from inception to date has incurred an accumulated deficit $7,557,449. As of September 30, 2016, its current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $892,647.  The Company may not be sufficient to pay for the operating expenses in next 12 months. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These factors noted above raise substantial doubts regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements present the financial position and the results of operations of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiaries, Makeliving, Ltd. and PDI Global Limited (a British Virgin Islands corporation,  PDI ).  PDI, in turn, is the 100% owner and consolidates Sinoforte Limited, a Hong Kong corporation.   
   
 All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
  Interim Financial Statements  
   
 The following (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and (b) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 25, 2016. 
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605-10 ) which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

6 

ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements ( ASC 605-25 ).  ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.  The effect of implementing ASC 605-25 on the Company's financial position and results of operations was not significant. 
   
 The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or services have not been rendered or are subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or services have been rendered or no refund will be required. 
   
 Revenues on the sale of products, net of estimated costs of returns and allowance, are recognized at the time products are shipped to customers, legal title has passed, and all significant contractual obligations of the Company have been satisfied. Products are generally sold on open accounts under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the customers and generally does not require collateral to secure the accounts receivable. 
   
 The Company is exploring web based e-commerce to bring buyers and sellers together recognizing revenue as commissions on closed transactions. 
   
   Segment information   
   
 ASC 280-10 establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. ASC 280-10 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic areas.  Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance.  All sales and substantial assets of the Company are in China. The Company applies the management approach to the identification of our reportable operating segments as provided in accordance with ASC 280-10.  The information disclosed herein materially represents all of the financial information related to the Company s principal operating segment. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
   Concentration of Credit Risk   
   
 The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to a concentration of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable.  Generally, the Company s cash and cash equivalents in interest-bearing accounts may exceed FDIC insurance limits. The financial stability of these institutions is periodically reviewed by senior management. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company maintained $232,848 and $536,491 in foreign bank accounts not subject to FDIC coverage. 
   
 The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits held by banks.  
   
   Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
   
 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 220-10, Comprehensive Income ( ASC 220-10 ) which establishes standards for the reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owners sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. ASC 220-10 requires other comprehensive income (loss) to include foreign currency translation adjustments. 
   
   Foreign Currency Translation   
   
 The Company translates the foreign currency financial statements into US Dollars ( USD ) using the year or reporting period-end or average exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 830-10, Foreign  

7 

Currency Matters ( ASC 830-10 ).  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect for the periods presented.  
   
 The financial statements were presented in US Dollars except as other specified. 
   
 The cumulative translation adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) within stockholders  equity (deficit).  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated results of operations. 
   
 The conversion rates of Hong Kong Dollars ( HKD ) to USD at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $7.7561 and $7.7515, respectively and average rates of $7.7640 and $7.753 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company uses historical rates for stockholders  equity accounts. 
   
  Property, plant and equipment  
   
 The Company evaluates the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The carrying value of an item of property, plant and equipment is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value.  The Company measures impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value of the respective asset exceeds its fair value.  Fair value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. 
   
 Depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $-0- and $-0, respectively. 
   
  Advertising Costs  
   
 The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred.  Advertising expenses were $-0- and $-0- for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    
   
  Fair Value Measurement  
   
 ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This topic does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: 

Level 1    
   Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
  
    Level 2    
   Other inputs that is directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
                 
    Level 3    
   Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 

The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 
   
  Earnings (Loss) Per Share  
   
 Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential dilutive instruments such as stock options and warrants.   
   
 The effect of stock options on diluted EPS is determined through the application of the treasury stock method, whereby proceeds received by the Company based on assumed exercises are hypothetically used to repurchase the Company's common stock at the average market price during the period.  The Company has no stock options, warrants or other potentially dilutive instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

SCHEDULE OF EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  NOTE 2   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  
   
 Furniture and equipment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows: 

Depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $-0- and $-0-, respectively. 
   
  NOTE 3   CAPITAL STOCK  
   
 The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value.

   Overview   
   
 The Company conducts business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary Sinoforte Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation. 
   
 Prior to August 2011, the Company operated primarily as a merchant, buying and selling various type and grades of graphite, such as medium- and high-carbon graphite, high-purity graphite, micro-powder graphite and expandable graphite. As a merchant, the Company acted as a reseller. It purchased graphite products in bulk, primarily from graphite producers, and resold them, either in bulk or in smaller quantities (in either case, without further processing), to various small and mid-sized customers.     
   
 In August 2011, the Company started to engage in a business of e-commerce platform.  Currently the Company is in the process of developing a website,  Makeliving.com  ( Makeliving ), which provides an e-commerce platform, where registered members can exchange goods and services.  
   
 Makeliving will act both as a platform and as a conduit between those (individuals or companies) who desire to acquire goods and services and those (individuals or companies) who desire to offer goods and services.  Makeliving plans to charge a certain percentage fee for the transactions.  The website is under trial operation, and there are no revenues that have been generated.  Currently the Company is exploring on ways to attract the attention of prospective customers.

 Until we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations, we intend to continue to fund operations from cash on-hand, and through private debt or equity placements of our securities. Our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to generate sufficient liquidity from operations and/or raise additional capital through such sources as equity and debt financings, collaborative and licensing agreements and strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that additional capital will become available or, if it does, that it will become available on acceptable terms, or that any additional capital we may obtain will be sufficient to meet our long-term needs. We currently have no commitments for any additional capital, both internally and externally.

 In preparing the financial statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).  GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis.  Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.   
   
 We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied.  Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our financial statements.

 A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information in this Item. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  
   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )).  Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
   Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   
   
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
