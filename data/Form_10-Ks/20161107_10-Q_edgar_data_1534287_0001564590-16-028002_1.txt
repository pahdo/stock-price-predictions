1. Summary of significant accounting policies  
 Basis of presentation  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Securities and Exchange ( SEC ) rules and regulations and using the same accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in BioAmber Inc. (BioAmber or the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, except for the adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2015-03, as referenced in paragraph Retrospective changes below. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the opinion of the Company s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The Company s management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 or any other future period. 
 Risk and uncertainties 
 BioAmber is an industrial biotechnology company producing sustainable chemicals. The Company s activities since inception have consisted principally of  raising capital for performing research and development activities, developing markets  related to its bio-succinic acid product and derived products, acquiring technology patents,  producing and selling bio-succinic acid from a  large-scale demonstration facility in Pomacle, France and from its Sarnia facility , and building its Sarnia facility.   The attainment of profitable operations is dependent upon future events, including  operation of the commercial-scale manufacturing facility  in Sarnia, Ontario,  further advancing its existing commercial arrangements with strategic partners to generate revenue from the sale of its products that will support the Company s cost structure ,  gaining market acceptance for its bio-succinic acid, its derivatives and other building block chemicals,  obtaining adequate financing to complete its development activities, and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  
   
 Retrospective changes 
 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  on a retrospective basis in the three months ended March 31, 2016. In accordance with the adoption of this guidance, prior year amounts related to deferred debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt have been adjusted for the retrospective change in accounting principle. As of December 31, 2015, the Company  has reclassified $1.3 million of deferred financing costs associated with long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet, against the long-term debt. Refer to Note 7 for further information.  
   
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold includes costs directly associated with finish goods production, such as direct materials, direct labor, utilities and certain plant overhead. Cost of goods sold also includes a bnormal production costs from the Sarnia facility production volume ramp-up.  
   
 N et loss per share   
 The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per share , under which basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Shares issued and reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) is similar to the computation of the basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if all of the potentially dilutive shares of common stock had been issued. In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back any convertible preferred dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. The numerator is also adjusted for any other changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential shares of common stock such as profit-sharing expenses. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Losses have been incurred in each period since inception, at the exception of the previous quarter; accordingly, diluted loss per share is not presented.

    Recently adopted and recently issue  d accounting guidance  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ("ASU 2014-15"). This ASU requires management to assess and evaluate whether conditions or events exist, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements issue date. The provisions of ASU 2014-15 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption is permitted. Based on the outcome of our financial initiatives, additional disclosures may be required upon application of the ASU. 
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU-2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost.  ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  The amendments in ASU 2015-11 more closely align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ).  ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016.   The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on  its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which among other changes in accounting and disclosure requirements, replaces the cost method of accounting for non-marketable equity securities with a model for recognizing impairments and observable price changes, and also eliminates the available-for-sale classification for marketable equity securities. Under the new guidance, other than when the consolidation or equity method of accounting is utilized, changes in the fair value of equity securities are to be recognized in earnings. This guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on  its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases . The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on  its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on  its consolidated financial statements. 
   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  to address diversity in practice on certain specific cash flow issues. The ASU will be effective for the Company for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on  its consolidated financial statements.

 Sustainable Jobs and Investment Fund ( SJIF )     

 On September 30, 2011, BioAmber Sarnia and the Minister of Economic Development and Trade of Ontario, Canada (Sustainable Jobs Innovation Fund) entered into an agreement pursuant to which a loan in the amount of CAD$15,000,000, was granted to BioAmber Sarnia, according to the following principal terms:  

the loan is interest free during the first five years provided BioAmber Sarnia creates or retains an average of 31 jobs per year, calculated on an annual basis;      

the loan will bear interest from the fifth anniversary date of its disbursement at an annual rate of 3.98% (or 5.98% if BioAmber Sarnia does not fully achieve the cumulative job target for the first five years);      

the principal will be repayable in five annual equal installments from the sixth anniversary date of the disbursement of the loan;      

the loan is secured by a guarantee from BioAmber and Mitsui   Co., Ltd., the non-controlling shareholder of BioAmber Sarnia (the guarantee being limited to its percentage of ownership held in BioAmber Sarnia); and      

the loan is secured by (i) a general security agreement representing a valid charge on BioAmber Sarnia s present and future accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other personal property and (ii) a valid charge against the leasehold interest on the portion of the real property located in Sarnia Ontario, Canada and leased to BioAmber Sarnia.      

 As of September 30, 2016, all disbursements were received. The fair value of the loan was calculated using the method of the discounted future cash payments of principal and interest over the term of the loan. The discount rate used was between 12% and 15%, being the interest rates a loan with similar terms and conditions would carry.  
 The difference between the face value of the loan and the discounted amount of the loan was recorded as a short-term deferred grant and subsequently reclassified to reduce the cost of construction in-progress.  
 13 
 
    The discounted loan is being accreted to its face value through a charge in the consolidated statement of operations using the effective interest method over the term of the loan.   

ii)   
 
 Sustainable Chemistry Alliance ( SCA )     

 In November 2011, BioAmber Sarnia entered into a loan agreement with SCA in the amount of CAD$500,000. The loan was interest free until November 30, 2013, and the unpaid balance of the loan subsequently bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum compounded monthly. The loan s principal is repayable in 20 equal quarterly installments of CAD$25,000 from November 2015 to November 2020. The loan agreement contains various legal and financial covenants including i) third party credit facilities which could not exceed originally CAD$45 million in the aggregate as long as any principal of the loan remains outstanding, and ii) dividends may not be declared or paid without the consent of the lender. The loan agreement was amended to increase the third party credit facilities from CAD$45 million to CAD$60 million in the aggregate in June 2014, and subsequently from CAD$60 million to CAD$67.5 million in the aggregate in March 2016. These covenants were met as of September 30, 2016. 
 The loan was originally recorded at the discounted amount of the future cash payments of principal and interest over the term of the loan. The discount rate used was 15%, being the interest rate a loan with similar terms and conditions would carry.  
 The difference between the face value of the loan and the discounted amount of the loan was recorded as a deferred grant, and subsequently reclassified against operating expenses during the period ended December 31, 2015. 
 The discounted loan is being accreted to its face value through a charge in the consolidated statement of operations using the effective interest method over the term of the loan.  

iii)   
 
 Federal Economic Development Agency ( FEDDEV )     

 On September 30, 2011, BioAmber Sarnia and FEDDEV entered into a contribution agreement pursuant to which a loan of up to a maximum amount of CAD$12 million, was granted to BioAmber Sarnia. The loan is non-interest bearing with original repayment of principal from October 2013 to October 2018 in 60 monthly installments. The repayment terms were later modified as described below.  
 The loan agreement contains various legal and financial covenants ordinarily found in such government agency loan agreements. In addition, the following specific covenants also apply:  

(a)   
 
 the Company will carry appropriate amounts of liability and casualty insurance during the duration of the loan agreement;      

(b)   
 
 the Company will not allow change of control without prior written consent of the Minister.

Those warrants contain anti-dilution protection in the event securities are sold at a lower price than the warrant s original exercise price.  The anti-dilution protection  
 21 
 
  contains a price adjustment and an adjustment to the number of warrants. The fair value of the warrants are classified as a financial liability as a resu  lt of their characteristics, in accordance with FASB ASC 815.   A non-cash reclassification from equity to liability was recorded in the third quarter 2015  .  
   
 Following the May 2015 public offering, the exercise price per share of the April 2011 Warrants were adjusted to an exercise price of $10.11 per share and an additional 4,124 warrants were issued. The January 2016 public offering  also triggered an adjustment to the exercise price of the April 2011 Warrants and the June 2009 Warrants from $10.11 per share and $5.74 per share, respectively, to $9.65 per share and $5.67 per share, respectively.

Per the IPO warrants agreement, the Company has the possibility to extend the termination date without the consent of the holders. The initial fair value of the warrants was determined to be $2.02 per warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The warrants contain full ratchet, anti-dilution protection upon the issuance of any common stock, securities convertible into common stock, or certain other issuances at a price below the then-existing exercise price of the warrant, with certain exceptions. The exercise price of $11.00 per whole share of common stock is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock issuances or other similar events affecting the company s common stock. At issuance, the fair value of the warrants was classified as a financial liability as a result of their characteristics, in accordance with FASB ASC 815. The exercise price of the outstanding IPO Warrants were adjusted from $11.00 to $9.00  per whole share of common stock , and subsequently from $9.00 to $5.00  per whole share of common stock ,  pursuant the terms of such warrants, following the May 2015 public offering and the January 2016 public offering, respectively .  The Company has the possibility to reduce the exercise price without the consent of the IPO Warrants holders. 
   
 On September 30, 2016, the closing value of the warrant on the New York Stock Exchange, a level 1 fair value measure, was $0.47 per warrant, as compared to $1.41 per warrant on December 31, 2015. As a result, the liability was revalued at the balance sheet date resulting in a financial charge (income) of $960,000 and $(1,536,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and of $(7,520,000) and $1,200,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 As at September 30, 2016, the Company had the following warrants and warrants financial liability outstanding to acquire common shares:  

13. Income taxes  
 Based on the Company s evaluation at September 30, 2016, management has concluded that there has been no change to the recorded uncertain tax positions requiring adjustments to deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance. Open tax years include the tax years December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2015.  
 For the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s effective income tax rates were nil% and (0.34)% respectively, compared to an applicable U.S. combined federal and state income tax rate of 35%. The difference between the effective tax rate and U.S. statutory tax rate as of September 30, 2016 is primarily due the existence of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including net operating losses and stock options. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded valuation allowances on deferred tax assets relating to current year losses and temporary differences.  
 23 
 
    The Company is subject to possible income tax examinations for its U.S. federal and state   income tax returns filed for the tax years 2011 to present. International tax statutes may vary widely regarding the tax years subject to examination, but generally range from 2011 to the present  .   
   
 14. Financial instruments  
 Currency risk  
 The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk as result of foreign-denominated transactions and balances. The Company does not hold any financial instruments that mitigate this risk. 
 Credit risk  
 The Company s exposure to credit risk as of September 30, 2016, is equal to the carrying amount of its financial assets.  
 Interest Rate Risk  
 We had cash balances totaling $15.9 million at September 30, 2016. These amounts were deposited in current and interest-bearing accounts and were held for working capital purposes. Our primary objective is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding our operations. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company s long-term loan with EDC bears interest at floating interest rate per annum based on the Canadian prime rate plus an interest spread of 5%. If the Canadian prime rate were to increase, the interest rates for the remaining term of the loan would increase. 
   
 15. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities  
 For cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments.  
 The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair value of long-term debt received from government organizations was determined using Level 3 information as the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques which are based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporates all relevant observable market inputs. The interest free loans were discounted using an interest rate between 12% and 15%, a level 3 fair value measurement, representing the interest rate a loan with similar terms and conditions would carry.  
 The fair value of the warrants which were issued upon the completion of the IPO on May 10, 2013 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using various assumptions described in Note 12, which was a level 3 fair value measurement. As these warrants started trading freely on the New York Stock Exchange on June 10, 2013, the closing value of these warrants, which is a level 1 measurement was used to calculate the fair value from June 10, 2013 onwards.  
 The fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the June 2009 and April 2011 financing transaction was calculated using the Monte Carlo model, which is a level 3 measurement.

 Overview  
       We are an industrial biotechnology company producing sustainable chemicals. Our proprietary technology platform combines industrial biotechnology and chemical catalysis to convert renewable f  eedstocks into sustainable chemicals that are cost-competitive replacements for petroleum-derived chemicals, which are used in a wide variety of everyday products including plastics, resins, paints, food additives and personal care products. We currently s  ell our first product, bio-succinic acid, to customers in a variety of chemical markets. We produce bio-succinic acid at our facility in Sarnia, Ontario  , pursuant to a joint venture agreement with Mitsui.  
 Succinic acid can be used to manufacture a wide variety of products used every day, including plastics, food additives and personal care products, and can also be used as a building block for a number of derivative chemicals. Today, petroleum-derived succinic acid is not used in many potential applications because of its relatively high production costs and selling price. We believe that our low-cost production capability and our development of next-generation bio-succinic derived products including 1,4 BDO, which is used to produce polyesters, plastics, spandex and other products, will provide us with access to a more than $10 billion market opportunity. 
   
 Prior to the completion of our Sarnia facility, we manufactured our bio-succinic acid at a large-scale demonstration facility in Pomacle, France for five years, under a toll manufacturing arrangement pursuant to which we compensated a third party, including for labor costs and the cost of producing our product. We shipped commercial quantities to customers, such as shipments of one ton super sacks and container loads. We and our customers used the products produced at the facility as part of our efforts to validate and optimize our process and to continue to refine and improve our bio-succinic acid to meet our customers  specifications. In preparation for transitioning our production from our Pomacle facility to our Sarnia facility, we accumulated a reserve inventory of our product, which was produced at a higher cost per metric ton of succinic acid than that expected cost of production at our Sarnia facility. 
   
             We are working to rapidly expand our accessible markets and product portfolio. We have entered into strategic relationships with several leading companies, such as our multi-year agreements with PTTMCC Biochem for bio-succinic acid and Vinmar for bio-succinic acid,   1,4 BDO and THF  . We have also entered into agreements with other   companies   for the supply of bio-succinic acid.  
     We have also entered into technology partnerships to lower our production costs, expand our product portfolio and enhance our bio  chemical production platform. For example, we entered into a technology partnership with Cargill, Inc., or Cargill, through which we exclusively license a proprietary yeast organism for use in our fermentation process to produce our products. We refer to t  he yeast organism that we have licensed from Cargill as  our yeast.  We have also established other technology licenses and collaborations, including with Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies, or Davy.  
 26 
 
    Our business strategy is to leverage the value of our technology by building and operating production facilities around the world. However, depending on our access to capital and third-party demand for our technology, we may also enter into technology lice  nses on an opportunistic basis.   
     We have entered into a joint venture agreement with Mitsui   Co. Ltd. for our facility in Sarnia, Ontario, which has a nameplate capacity of 30,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid per year.  We started commercial scale production at our Sarnia facility in October 2015 and ramp-up to full production capacity is expected in 2018. We terminated production at the large-scale demonstration facility in Pomacle, France at the end of 2014. Our joint venture with Mitsui also contemplates the potential construction and operation of an additional facility, which we expect to occur over the next three to five years. 
   On May 9, 2013, we raised net proceeds of $71.7 million from the initial public offering of our equity securities. In July 2014, we completed a secondary public offering and issued 3,220,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, for a total of approximately $36.0 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. On May 6, 2015, we completed the closing of a secondary public offering and issued 3,900,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price to the public of $9.00 per share, for a total of approximately $32.8 million in net procee  ds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us.  On January 21, 2016, we completed the closing of a secondary public offering and issued 2,600,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price to the public of $5.00 per share, for a total of approximately $11.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had raised an aggregate of $292.8 million from public offerings of our equity securities, private placements of our equity securities, and the sale of shares issued by a subsidiary and convertible notes. 
 Sarnia Facility 
 Our first commercial-scale facility is on land we own and is located within a bio-industrial park in Sarnia, Ontario. The site is co-located in a large petrochemical hub with existing infrastructure that facilitates access to utilities and certain raw materials and finished product shipment, including steam, electricity, cooling water and water treatment. The facility has a nameplate capacity of 30,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid per year and we started commercial scale production in October 2015.  
         The plant has received ISO 9001 (for its quality management system), ISO 14001 (for its environmental management s  ystem, OHSAS 18001 (for its health and safety management system) and FSSC 22000 certification (for its food safety management system).  These certifications were granted by accredited certification bodies   following audits of the Sarnia plant in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
     In November 2011, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Mitsui to finance and build and operate our facility in Sarnia, Ontario through BioAmber Sarnia, a joint venture 70% owned by us and 30% owned by Mitsui. On February 15, 2016  , we,   together with our subsidiaries BioAmber International s.  r.l. and BioAmber Sarnia, entered into Second Amended JV Agreement   with Mitsui pursuant to which Mitsui provided BioAmber Sarnia an additional capital contribution for an aggregate amount of CAD$25 million, which increased Mitsui s share ownership to approximately 40%.  We have retained effective operational control of the joint venture.  
 The total construction cost of our facility in Sarnia was approximately $141.5 million, funded through capital contributions from us and from Mitsui, and interest free and low-interest loans and governmental grants.  
     Additional Planned Manufacturing Facilities 
   We plan to build a second integrated manufacturing facility that will produce approximately 200,000 metric tons per year of bio-succinic acid and then transform a majority of the bio-succinic acid into 70,000 metric tons per year of bio-based 1,4 BDO and 24,000 metric tons per year of THF, along with 60,000 metric tons per year of crystalline succinic acid. We have signed two 15 year offtake agreements with Vinmar for 100% of the BDO and THF output (100,000 metric tons per year) and 67% of the succinic acid output of this second planned facility. Vinmar plans to take a 10% equit  y stake in the plant. We are actively seeking other minority equity partners for this facility, as well as government support in the form of low interest loans and loan guarantees. Based on current estimates and assumptions, we expect this commercial scale manufacturing facility to have construction costs of approximately $500 million, and it would be commissioned in late 2019 assuming we achieve a financial close in late 2017.  
 27 
 
    Performance Drivers  
 We expect that the fundamental drivers of our results of operations going forward will be the following:  
         Commercialization of our products.  We commenced recognizing revenue from sales of our existing bio-succinic acid product in 2011. Our ability to grow revenue from this product will be dependent on expanding th  e addressable market for succinic acid using our low-cost, bio-based alternative. We also expect to grow our revenue base by developing new value-added applications and derivative products. For example,   we signed a supply agreement   with PTTMCC Biochem in A  pril 2014 for biodegradable plastics, and we have signed additional supply agreements in other new applications such as synthetic leather and other polyurethane applications, including coatings (polyurethane dispersions) made from bio-based succinic acid and recycled PET. We also plan to develop and commercialize derivatives of succinic acid, such as BDO and THF, and to target large and established chemical markets such as adipic acid, where succinic acid can partially substitute the incumbent chemical.  
                 In   April 2014, we entered into a three year supply agreement with PTTMCC Biochem, a joint venture between PTT Public Company Limited and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation that was established to produce and sell polybutylene succinate, or PBS, a biodegradable p  lastic made from succinic acid and BDO. PTTMCC has constructed a PBS plant in Thailand and is   currently ramping-up the plant production, which is expected to consume approximately 14,000 metric tons of succinic acid per year at full capacity. This supply a  greement provides that we will exclusively supply a minimum of 80% of PTTMCC Biochem s total bio-succinic needs until the end of 2017, with approximately 50% of the total purchases under offtake terms. We also entered into a second offtake agreement with V  inmar in July 2014, to supply Vinmar with   10,000 metric   tons of bio-succinic acid   per year for 15 years from the Sarnia plant. Our arrangements with PTTMCC and Vinmar represent two of the potential customers and applications that we are targeting for the bio-succinic acid produced at our Sarnia facility. These supply agreements reflect our ongoing efforts to expand the succinic acid addressable market into new applications. 
 We have also entered into several agreements and memorandum of understanding, or MOUs, that contemplate, but do not obligate, us to supply approximately 16,000 metric tons of bio-succinic acid until the end of 2017 and, as we continue operation of our facility in Sarnia, Ontario, we are actively seeking to enter into definitive supply agreements and form new relationships with potential customers. 
         Our revenue for future periods will be impacted by our ability to develop new applications and the speed with which we are able to bring our succinic acid derivatives to market. To accelerate thi  s process, we have developed our sales and marketing capability and entered into distribution and joint development agreements with strategic partners. On   February 15,   2016, we, together with our subsidiaries BioAmber International s.  r.l. and BioAmber Sarnia, entered into a Second Amended JV Agreement with Mitsui pursuant to which Mitsui provided BioAmber Sarnia with   additional capital contributions for an aggregate amount of CAD$25 million, which increased Mitsui s share ownership to approximately 40%.  We have retained effective operational control of the joint venture. 
 We are also engaging in a collaborative process with our customers to test and optimize new applications and derivative products such as BDO and THF in order to ensure that they meet specifications in each of their potential applications. We continue to seek to establish supply agreements and distribution agreements with strategic customers as we expand our markets and product offerings.  For example, in October 2014, we entered into a five-year exclusive supply agreement with Xuchuan Chemicals, a global leader in polyester polyols, to supply bio-based succinic acid from our Sarnia facility to be used in manufacturing cast polyurethane elastomers.   Xuchuan is initially launching polyurethane (PU) systems for cast polyurethane elastomers (CPU) made with bio-succinic acid. CPU is used in applications including automotive instruments, caster wheels, industrial and mining equipment, power tools, industrial tires, coating rolls, drive belts, mold makers and hoses. By replacing adipic acid with succinic acid, Xuchuan has produced CPUs that offer better properties: they are more abrasion/scratch resistant and more resistant to solvents. Other applications for our bio-based succinic acid include polyurethane elastomers and dispersions for shoe soles and synthetic leather. 
     Production capacity.  Our ability to lower our production costs and drive customer adoption of our product is dependent on our manufacturing strategy. We expect to produce bio-succinic   acid that is cost-competitive with succinic acid produced from oil priced as low as $30.00   per barrel. We expect to further reduce costs by implementing on-going process improvements. We intend to capitalize on our first-to-market advantage by rapidly expanding our production capacity and building additional facilities. Our results will be impacted by the speed with which we execute on this strategy, the capital costs and operating expenses of each of these facilities, and the price of oil and the impact it has on the price of petrochemicals our succinic acid substitutes.   
   Feedstock and other manufacturing input prices.  We use sugars that can be derived from wheat, corn, sugar cane and other feedstocks. We intend to locate our facilities near readily available sources of sugars and other inputs, such as steam, electricity and hydrogen, in order to ensure reliable supply of cost-competitive feedstocks and utilities. While our process requires less sugar than   
 28 
 
  most other renewable products and is therefore less vulnerable to sugar price increases relative to other bio-based processes, our margins will be affected by signific  ant fluctuations in these required inputs.   
   Petroleum prices.  We expect sales of our bio-based products to be impacted by the price of petroleum. In the event that petroleum prices increase, we may see increased demand for our products as chemical manufact  urers seek lower-cost alternatives to petroleum-derived chemicals. Conversely, a long-term reduction in petroleum prices below $30.00 per barrel may result in our products being less competitive with petroleum-derived alternatives. In addition, oil prices may also impact the cost of certain feedstocks we use in our process, which may affect our operating profits.  
 Recent Developments 
 SDTC Grant  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received the SDTC grant holdback payment of CAD$1,451,365 or $1,108,262 when converted into U.S. dollars as of September 30, 2016, following the achievement of the last SDTC milestone. 
 Bridging Loan  
 On September 9, 2016, we entered into a CAD$ 25 million demand non-revolving credit facility with Bridging Finance Inc. The proceeds were used to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of our prior loan with Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC and the remainder will be used to fund general corporate expenses. Refer to Note 7 of the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details. 
   
 BDC Loan 
 On August 20, 2016, we received the proceeds from our CAD$10 million loan between BDC and BioAmber Sarnia according to the binding Letter of Offer dated April 20, 2016.  The proceeds will be used to fund the working capital of   BioAmber Sarnia s facility, repayable starting October 15, 2017 continuing monthly until September 15, 2022.   Refer to Note 7 of the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more details.   
 29 
 
    Mitsui additional capital contribution   
 On February 15, 2016, we, together with our subsidiaries BioAmber International s.  r.l. and BioAmber Sarnia, entered into a S econd Amended JV Agreement  with Mitsui pursuant to which Mitsui agreed to provide BioAmber Sarnia with additional capital contributions for an aggregate amount of CAD$25 million, which increased Mitsui s share ownership to approximately 40%. As a result of Mitsui s additional capital contribution, BioAmber Sarnia agreed to increase the size of its board of directors from five to six members, and we and Mitsui have the right to designate three members each.  All BioAmber Sarnia board decisions have to be approved by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the BioAmber Sarnia board members, except that with respect to the following matters, we, as the controlling shareholder of BioAmber Sarnia, have a deciding vote and have the right to make a final decision: (i) the approval and any amendment to any annual budget, including capital expenditures required to maintain the plant in operation, (ii) the hiring and termination of BioAmber Sarnia personnel and their compensation, and (iii) the execution of any raw material or utility supply agreements that are needed in the ordinary course of business.  We also agreed that in the event that Mitsui s equity stake in BioAmber Sarnia increases to above 45% in the future, we would no longer have the deciding votes described in the preceding sentence.    
 Public Offering of Common Stock 
         On January 21, 2016, we completed the closing of a follow-on public offering and issued 2,600,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price to the public of $5.00 per share. The gross aggregate proceeds from this secondary public offerin  g were approximately $13.0 million, with net proceeds of approximately $11.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by us. This public offering also triggered a further adjustment to the exercise price of the o  utstanding IPO Warrants, from $9.00 per whole share of common stock to $5.00 per whole share of common stock. The exercise price of the 2011 Warrants and the warrants that we issued in June 2009 were also reduced following the completion of this public offering, from $10.11 per share and $5.74 per share, respectively, to $9.65 per share and $5.67 per share, respectively. An additional 4,713 warrants at an exercise price of $9.65 and an additional 2,580 warrants at an exercise price of $5.67 per share were issued following adjustments in the number of shares underlying the warrants that were triggered by this issuance.  
 Financial Operations Overview  
 Revenue  
 Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of products and services in the ordinary course of our activities and is presented net of discounts.  
 We expect revenue to grow as our sales and marketing efforts continue and our facility in Sarnia, Ontario increases its volumes of commercial production. Most of our current sales are products from our Sarnia facility, with the remainder consisting of remaining inventory produced by our Pomacle facility before we terminated production there on December 31, 2014. 
  Cost of Goods Sold  
 For products manufactured in Pomacle, France, cost of goods sold consists of the cost to produce finished goods under our tolling arrangement that ended on December 31, 2014. For finished goods produced at Sarnia facility, cost of goods sold consists of costs directly associated with the finish goods production, such as direct materials, direct labor, utilities and certain plant overhead.  
 The costs to produce product in Pomacle, France, was higher than we expect to incur in the future at Sarnia due to the higher raw material costs such as sugar and utilities, the amount of fixed costs relative to the total production capacity available to us, and the inefficiencies created by the need to stop production from time to time to allocate the capacity to other parties. Going forward, from the succinic acid produced in Sarnia, we expect our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues to decrease as we ramp-up to a full scale commercial production and will benefit from efficiencies in utilizing our yeast in the fermentation process at the Sarnia facility.  
 Operating Expenses  
 Operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, net, sales and marketing expenses, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, write-offs of intangible assets and foreign exchange gains and losses.  
 General and Administrative Expenses  
   General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs (salaries, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), recruitment and relocation expenses, accounting and legal fees, business travel expenses, rent and utilities for  
 30 
 
  the administrative offices, web site design, press releas  es, membership fees, office supplies, corporate insurance programs, administration expenses related to our Sarnia facility, and other miscellaneous expenses.   
 We expect these expenses to increase in the future as we hire additional management, finance and administration employees to respond to a growing revenue base. 
 Research and Development Expenses  
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid for contract research and internal research costs in connection with the development, expansion and enhancement of our proprietary technology platform. These costs also include personnel costs (salaries and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), expenses incurred in our facility located in Plymouth, Minnesota, laboratory supplies, research consultant costs, patent and trademark maintenance costs, royalties, professional and consulting fees and business travel expenses. It also includes development costs for bringing our Sarnia facility in line for production. 
   We expect research and development expenses, including our patent maintenance expenses, to decrease since we have deployed and implemented our bio-succinic acid in a commercial scale manufacturing facility. We expect to continue conducting research and developmen  t in-house, and recently moved from our 27,000 square foot facility in Plymouth, Minnesota to our new 2,000 square foot facility in St. Paul, Minnesota, to meet our actual research and development needs.  Certain research and development activities that can be performed more effectively by outside consultants will be performed with their respective expertise as required.  
 Sales and Marketing Expenses  
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (salaries, and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation), marketing services, product development costs, advertising, selling and distributor costs and feasibility study fees.  
     Following our agreement signed with Mitsui in February 2016, we expect to decrease our sales   and marketing efforts while leveraging Mitsui s   global sales platforms along with its dedicated commercial team. 
 Depreciation of Property and Equipment and Amortization of Intangible Assets  
 Depreciation of property and equipment consists primarily of the depreciation of our Sarnia production facility, machinery and equipment, office furniture, research and development equipment and computer equipment, which is depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of our definite-lived license and amortization of computer software and licenses, which are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation of property and equipment increased significantly since our manufacturing facilities operations started. As of September 30, 2016, $20.3 million of net grants were applied as a reduction of machinery and equipment and building. This reduces depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset.  
 Foreign Exchange (Gain) Loss  
 We expect to conduct operations throughout the world. Our financial position and results of operations will be affected by economic conditions in countries where we plan to operate and by the changing foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to changes in exchange rates in Europe and Canada. The Euro and the Canadian Dollar are our most significant foreign currency exchange risks. A strengthening of the Euro and the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar may increase our revenues and expenses since they are expressed in U.S. Dollars. As we increase our production from our manufacturing facility in Sarnia, Ontario, we expect our foreign currency risk to continue as a significant portion of our uses of cash will be denominated in Canadian Dollars while our sources of cash will be primarily in U.S. Dollars and in Euros. We will monitor foreign currency exposures and will look to mitigate exposures through normal business operations such as manufacturing and selling in the same currencies where practical or buying required currencies at spot where advantageous. We may use forward contracts or currency swaps to mitigate any remaining exposures.  
 Amortization of Debt Discounts  
   Amortization of debt discounts consists primarily of costs from past financings that are recognized over the life of the funding instrument and will continue to increase in line with the expenses incurred to obtain future financing. Those costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis, which is approximately the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt. Amortization  
 31 
 
  of debt discounts also includes the accretion of the debt discount on the interest free or low-interest loans received from the government agencies.  
 Financial Charges (Income), Net  
 Financial charges (income), net, include interest on short-term and long-term debt, end of term accretion charge from the TCP loan and the recognition of gains or losses resulting from the mark-to-market adjustment required at the balance sheet date on our IPO Warrants, 2009 Warrants and 2011 Warrants.   
   We account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity,  as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement. Derivative warrant liabilities were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model at the date of initial issuance and using the closing value as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange at each s  ubsequent balance sheet date. The 2009 Warrants and 2011 Warrants are valued using the Monte Carlo method.  
 Income Taxes  
 We are subject to income taxes in Luxembourg, the United States and Canada. We have incurred significant losses and have not generated taxable income in these jurisdictions, with the exception of Canada. In the future, we expect to become subject to taxation based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. We have incurred net losses since our inception and have not recorded any federal, state or foreign current income tax provisions, with the exception of (i) recognition of unrecognized tax benefits since inception, (ii) a recovery of income taxes in the 258 day period ended September 30, 2009, and (iii) recognition of current income taxes in Canada. We have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Additionally, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be limited if a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% is deemed to have occurred within a three year period. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has occurred after each of our previous issuances of shares of common stock and warrants. 
 32 
 
    Comparison of Three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
 The following table shows the amounts of the listed items from our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented, showing period-over-period changes:  

Product sales  
 Product sales increased from $352,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in product volume sold, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price.  
 Cost of goods sold  
 Cost of goods sold increased from $367,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in volume sold, as well as Sarnia facility ramp-up costs, including fixed costs and reprocessing costs for off-specifications products that were allocated to the cost of goods sold. 
 General and administrative expenses  
 General and administrative expenses decreased by $453,000 to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was driven by a decrease in salaries and benefits expense and recruitment fees, offset by an increase in salaries and benefits expense associated with the Sarnia facility transition from construction to production stage, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.  
 Research and development expenses  
 Research and development expenses decreased by $4.2 million to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was due to the fact that the costs related to the commissioning of the plant incurred in the prior year were recorded in research and development. It is also explained by reduced expenses related to the molecular engineering of the yeast and lower costs related to intellectual property, partially offset by an increase in royalties expense associated with sales from Sarnia facility. 
 33 
 
    Sales   and marketing expenses   
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $442,000 to $479,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $921,000 the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was driven by a decrease in salaries, benefits and associated costs, including stock-based compensation and travel expense, following the reorganization of our commercial function in the first quarter of 2016. 
 Foreign exchange (gain) loss  
 The foreign exchange (gain) loss decreased from a loss of $610,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to a gain of $29,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This slight gain during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was driven by a relative stability of the U.S. Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Financial charges (income), net  
 Financial charges (income), net decreased to a charge of $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to an income of $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This variation of $4.7 million is mainly due to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment change of $3.4 million on the warrants that were part of the units issued in our IPO, as well as on the June 2009 Warrants and the April 2011 Warrants. It is also due to an increase in end of term charge of $602,000 and interest and other charges of $600,000 in connection with the repayment of TCP loan during the third quarter 2016. 
   
 Grant income 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Milestone IV from SDTC grant was completed and reclassified from deferred grant to grant income, along with a portion of the remaining 10% holdback.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 The following table shows the amounts of the listed items from our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented, showing period-over-period changes: 

Product sales  
 Product sales increased from $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in product volume sold, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price.  
 Cost of goods sold  
 Cost of goods sold increased from $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in volume sold, as well as Sarnia facility ramp-up costs, including fixed costs and reprocessing costs for off-specifications products that were allocated to the cost of goods sold. 
 General and administrative expenses  
 General and administrative expenses decreased by $436,000, to $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was driven by a decrease in incentive employee remuneration, in stock-based compensation expense and in recruiting costs. It is offset by an increase in salaries and benefits expense associated with the Sarnia facility transition from construction to production stage. 
 Research and development expenses, net  
   Research and development expenses, net, decreased by $10.4 million, to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was due to the fact that the costs related to the commissioning of the plant incurred in the prior year were recorded in research and development. It is also explained by reduced expenses related to the molecular engineering of the yeast, lower costs related to intellectual property and decrease in stock-based  
 35 
 
  compensation expe  nse. Those reductions are partially offset by an increase in royalties expense associated with sales from Sarnia facility.  
 Sales and marketing expenses  
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $1.0 million to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3.2 million the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was driven by a decrease in salaries, benefits and associated costs, including stock-based compensation and travel expense, following the reorganization of our commercial function in the first quarter of 2016. 
   
 Foreign exchange loss  
 The foreign exchange loss decreased by $751,000 to $117,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a loss $868,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The foreign exchange loss was driven by a strengthening of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which impacted our debt in Canadian dollar with Bridging, and our U.S. Dollar trade receivable balance in our subsidiary with Canadian functional currency. 
 Financial charges (income), net  
 Financial charges (income), net comprised of an income of $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a charge $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This variation of $7.5 million is mainly due to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment change of $8.5 million on the warrants that were part of the units issued in our IPO, as well as on the June 2009 Warrants and the April 2011 Warrants, offset by an increase in end of term charge of $517,000 and interest and other charges of $600,000 in connection with the repayment of TCP loan during the third quarter 2016. 
   
 Grant income 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Milestone IV from SDTC grant was completed and reclassified from deferred grant to grant income, along with a portion of the remaining 10% holdback. 
   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 From inception through September 30, 2016, we have funded our operations primarily from an aggregate of $292.8 million raised from public offerings of our equity securities, private placements of our equity securities, and the sale of shares issued by a subsidiary and convertible notes, including  net proceeds of $11.9 million from our January 2016 public offering of our common stock and Mitsui s additional capital contribution of CAD$25.0 million in the first quarter of 2016. We also received  CAD$82 million from loan and grant proceeds from various Canadian institutional and government agencies in BioAmber Sarnia, including CAD$10 million from BDC in August 2016, and proceeds of CAD$25 million from a demand non-revolving credit facility with Bridging at the corporate level in September 2016. 
 We began commissioning and start-up of our Sarnia facility in March 2015, achieved mechanical completion in June 2015 and started production in the last quarter of 2015. We will require funds to ramp up production levels at our Sarnia facility and for general corporate purposes. We expect to fund these needs through available cash on hand and by other strategies, including one or more of the following:  

Increase revenues from succinic acid sales    

Reduce our production costs at our Sarnia facility    

Reduce or delay operating expenses as deemed appropriate in order to conserve cash    

Trigger the exercise of our IPO warrants, if needed    

Raise additional equity capital and or debt financing    

Based on these initiatives listed above and the cash on hand at September 30, 2016, we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.   
   There are certain covenants in our debt and grant agreements, which are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We are in compliance with all of the covenants provided in each of these agreements. We expect to continue to be in   compliance with these covenants in the future.  
 The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands): 

36 

Operating activities  
 The cash from operating activities is primarily used for general and administrative expenses and research and development activities. These include expenses on research and development projects, expenses related to the Sarnia facility production operations, consultancy and advisory fees from third parties, licensing and royalty expenses, payroll expenses, legal and accounting expenses and office rent and utilities.  
 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $33.1 million reflected our net loss of $16.3 million, which was adjusted for non-cash items of $3.3 million and a negative change in operating assets and liabilities of $13.5 million. Non-cash adjustments included stock-based compensation of $2.7 million, $3.6 million of depreciation and amortization, financial income of $8.1 million including the mark-to-market accounting for our financial liability warrants and the end of term charge on long-term debt, amortization of debt discounts of $2.5 million and grant income of $4.0 million. The amount of operating assets and liabilities is a net outflow of $13.5 million due to a decrease in current liabilities and an increase in current assets. 
 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $22.5 million reflected our net loss of $32.3 million, which was adjusted for non-cash charges of $6.6 million and a positive change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.2 million. Non-cash expense adjustments included stock-based compensation of $3.9 million, $1.1 million of intangible assets write-off and financial charges of $1.0 million including the mark-to-market accounting for warrants that were part of the units issued in our IPO and the June 2009 and April 2011 Warrants, and the end of term charge on long-term debt. The amount of operating assets and liabilities is a net inflow of $3.2 million due to an increase in current liabilities and a decrease in current assets. 
 Investing activities  
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $540,000 included property and equipment purchases. 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $62.9 million included property and equipment purchases mostly related to the building of our facility in Sarnia, Ontario of $62.5 million. 
 Financing activities  
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $42.2 million included the proceeds from issuance of shares of the January 2016 public offering, for a total of $11.9 million, capital contributions by Mitsui to our BioAmber Sarnia joint venture of $17.7 million, principal reimbursement of various loans for $14.1 million, SDTC grant for $1.1 million, and new loan received from BDC and Bridging for a total of $27.0 million.  
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $70.5 million included the proceeds from issuance of shares including the May 2015 public offering, for a total of $33.1 million, an additional disbursement of $30.0 million from the government under the actual loans and grants agreements, including the loan proceeds of the CAD$20.0 million commercial loan from a financial consortium including Export Canada Development (EDC), Comerica, and Farm Credit Canada, capital contributions by Mitsui to our BioAmber Sarnia joint venture of $9.0 million, and reimbursement of our EDC loan for $0.6 million. 
 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  
 During the periods presented, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are  
 37 
 
  reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the fi  nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results   include fair value determination of assets, liabilities, fair value of intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and value of certain equity and debt instruments. These critical accounting pol  icies are the same as those detailed in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
   
 Recent accounting pronouncements  
  For information on recent accounting pronouncements, see  Recently adopted and recently issued accounting guidance  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Item   3.   
 
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     

 Interest Rate Risk  
 We had cash totaling $15.9 million at September 30, 2016. These amounts were deposited in current and interest-bearing accounts and were held for working capital purposes. The company s long-term loan with EDC bears interest at floating interest rate per annum based on the Canadian prime rate plus an interest spread of 5%. If the Canadian prime rate were to increase, the interest rates for the remaining term of the loans would increase. 
 Commodity Price Risk  
 We use glucose in our processes, which can be derived from corn, wheat and other feedstocks. Thus, our raw material is sensitive to price fluctuations in feedstock commodities. Prices of corn, wheat and other feedstocks are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather, quantities planted and harvested, changes in national and global supply and demand, and government programs and policies. 
 Foreign Currency Risk  
 We currently conduct our operations in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk is expected to increase with the ramp-up of our Sarnia facility, as our sources of cash are primarily in U.S. dollars, while our uses of cash are primarily in Canadian dollars. We will monitor the amounts and timing of foreign currency exposures related to the operations of the facility and will look to mitigate exposure through normal business operations such as manufacturing and selling in the same currencies where practical. We may use forward contracts or currency swaps to mitigate any remaining exposure. 

Item   4.   
 
   Controls and Procedures     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 As of September 30, 2016, our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e)  promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules, regulations and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
 Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls  
   Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the  
 38 
 
  objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control sys  tems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,   and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of   controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become i  nadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detect  ed.   
   
       PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

Item   1.   
 
 Legal Proceedings     

 We may be, from time to time, involved in the normal course of business in various legal proceedings. Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to our business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. There may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us.  

Item 1  A.

Except to the extent that information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors (including, without limitation, the matters described in Part I, Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ), there have been no material changes to our risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 15, 2016.

Exhibit 10.1 
 September  9 th  , 2016 
   
 BioAmber Inc. 
 1250 Rene-Levesque Blvd. West, Suite 4310 
 Montreal, Quebec,  
 Canada H3B 4W8 
   
 Attention:  President   CEO  
   
 Dear Mr. Jean-Fran ois Huc: 

Re:       
 
   Bridging Finance Inc. (in its capacity as lender, the   Lender  ), demand non-revolving credit facility in favour of the Borrower (as defined below)     

The Lender is pleased to offer the credit facility (the   Facility  ) described in this letter agreement (the   Agreement  )   subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein including, without limitation, the satisfactory completion of due diligence. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian currency. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the body of this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed hereto in Schedule  A . 

Borrower:   
 
  BioAmber Inc. (the   Borrower  ), a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of Delaware     

Lender:   Bridging Finance Inc.  

Guarantors:   
 
  BioAmber Canada Inc. and, if the BioAmber Lux Windup is not completed within 60 days of the date hereof, BioAmber International S.A.R.L (together, the  Guarantors )      

Facility:   
 
  Non-revolving demand loan of up to $25,000,000.  Subject to the provisions hereof, the Lender may demand payment in writing at any time and this Facility shall become payable by the Lender immediately upon receipt of such demand.     

Purpose:   
 
  To refinance certain amounts owed by the Borrower to Tennenbaum Capital Partners (  TCP  ) and for general working capital and corporate purposes.     

Loan 

Availability:   
 
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the amount available under the Facility may be drawn only in a single advance on the date of the initial advance under the Facility, at which time any undrawn amount under the Facility shall be permanently cancelled.    

Interest Rate 

and Fees:   
 
    Interest:   Interest shall accrue at an annual rate of Bank of Montreal Prime plus ten and eight tenths of one percent (  10.8  %) calculated on the daily outstanding balance of the Facility and compounded monthly, not in advance and with no deemed reinvestment of monthly payments. On the occurrence of an Event of Default, interest shall be calculated at an annual rate of twenty-one percent (21%) per annum calculated and compounded as aforesaid.   Bank of Montreal Prime shall mean   the floating annual rate of interest established from time to time by the Bank of Montreal as the base rate it will use to determine rates of interest on Canadian dollar loans to customers in Canada and      

1 

designated as its Prime Rate.       

Work Fee:   A work fee of one and fifty hundredths of one percent (1.50%) of the size of the Facility, plus any applicable taxes due thereon, shall be due and payable by the Borrower to the Lender at the time of the first advance of the Facility and shall be deducted from the advance of the Facility.    

Administration Fee : If the Borrower fails to pay any amounts on the day such amounts are due or if the Borrower fails to deliver the required reports set out herein, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender a late administration fee of $100.00 per day, plus any applicable taxes due thereon, until such date that such payment has been made or the Borrower has delivered such report, as the case may be.  
   
  Expenses:  The Borrower shall pay all fees and expenses (including, but not limited to, all due diligence, consultant, field examination and appraisal costs, all fees and expenses for outside legal counsel and other outside professional advisors and the time spent by the Lender and its representatives in retaking, holding, repairing, processing and preparing for disposition and disposing of the Security calculated at the Lender s standard per diem rate in effect at such applicable time and established by the Lender  in its sole discretion for internal personnel of the Lender) reasonably incurred by the Lender in connection with the preparation, registration and ongoing administration of this Agreement and the Security and with the enforcement of the Lender s rights and remedies under this Agreement or the Security, whether or not any amounts are advanced under this Agreement.  I f the Lender has paid any expense for which the Lender is entitled to reimbursement from the Borrower and such expense has not been deducted from the advance of the Facility, such expense shall be payable by the Borrower upon demand therefor from the Lender.   All such fees and expenses and interest thereon shall be secured by the Security only if the funds under the Facility are advanced.   

Payments:   
 
      Without limiting the right of the Lender to at any time demand repayment according to the terms of this Agreement, and subject to and in addition to the requirement for repayment in full pursuant to this Agreement at the end of the Term, interest only at the aforesaid rate, calculated daily and compounded and payable monthly, not in advance on the outstanding amount of the Facility, shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each and every month during the Term.         

Prepayment:   
 
  After April 1, 2017, the Facility can be repaid in full or partially at any time without any fee or penalty upon at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to the Lender (for clarity, the earliest date where such prepayment can occur without any fee or penalty is April 2, 2017, provided at least a ninety (90) days prior notice has been sent to the Lender).  After April 1, 2017, the Facility can also be repaid in full or partially at any time without any prior notice or with a prior notice of less than ninety (90) days, provided that in such event, or in the event of a termination of the Facility resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender an amount equal to the following formula:       

Where:    

I = the annual interest rate on the Facility on the date that notice of termination, or demand, as the case may be, is made    

N = the number of days between the date that notice of termination is provided, and the date of termination, provided that if such number is greater than ninety (90) days, it shall be equal to 90 for the purposes of this calculation, and if demand occurs during the occurrence of an     

2 

Event of Default, N shall equal 0     

M = the outstanding amount, including any interest and other fees owing, under this Agreement, on the date that notice of termination, or demand, as the case may be, is provided    

Deposit:      
 
  The Lender acknowledges that it has been paid a deposit of $80,000 towards its expenses by the Borrower and that any unused amount of such deposit will be credited against the Facility.     

Renewal:   
 
  Subject to demand by the Lender or the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default,   the Borrower acknowledges that the principal amount of the Facility is payable upon maturity at the end of the Term and that the Lender is not obligated to grant any renewal or extension of the Term.     

Application of  

Payments:   
 
  Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, all payments received by the Lender shall first be credited as repayment of interest and fees or other charges owing by the Borrower and then as repayment of the principal amount owing by the Borrower to the Lender hereunder.      

Conditions

Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to file financing statements, without notice to Borrower, with all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect or protect the Lender s interest or rights hereunder. Such financing statements may indicate the Collateral as  all assets of the Debtor  or words of similar effect, or as being of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater detail all in the Lender s discretion.
