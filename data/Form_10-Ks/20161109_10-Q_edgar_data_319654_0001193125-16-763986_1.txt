   PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION        

Item  1.  
  Financial Statements       The condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by Southwest
Bank as Trustee for the Permian Basin Royalty Trust (the  Trust ), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effective August 29, 2014, Southwest Bank (the  Trustee ) became
the new trustee for the Trust. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Trustee believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these condensed interim financial statements and notes thereto be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
Trust s latest annual report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Trustee, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Permian Basin Royalty
Trust at September 30, 2016, the distributable income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the changes in trust corpus for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been included. The
distributable income for such interim periods is not necessarily indicative of the distributable income for the full year.    The condensed interim
financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, included herein, have been reviewed by Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report appearing herein.    The condensed interim financial statements for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, included
herein, were previously reviewed by an independent registered public accounting firm.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
 To the Unit Holders of Permian Basin Royalty Trust and    Southwest
Bank, Trustee    Dallas, Texas    We have reviewed the
accompanying condensed statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus of Permian Basin Royalty Trust (the  Trust ) as of September 30, 2016 and the related condensed statements of distributable income for the three-month and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and changes in trust corpus for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Trustee.  
 We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 As described in Note 2 to the condensed interim financial statements, these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a modified cash basis
of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    Based on
our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such condensed interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)       

1.  
  TRUST ORGANIZATION AND PROVISIONS       The Permian Basin Royalty Trust ( Trust )
was established as of November 1, 1980. Southwest Bank ( Trustee ) is Trustee for the Trust. The net overriding royalties conveyed to the Trust include (1) a 75% net overriding royalty in Southland Royalty Company s fee mineral
interest in the Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas (the  Waddell Ranch properties ) and (2) a 95% net overriding royalty carved out of Southland Royalty Company s major producing royalty properties in Texas (the  Texas Royalty
properties ). The net overriding royalty for the Texas Royalty properties is subject to the provisions of the lease agreements under which such royalties were created. The net overriding royalties above are collectively referred to as the
 Royalties.     On November 3, 1980, Units of Beneficial Interest ( Units ) in the Trust were distributed to the Trustee
for the benefit of Southland Royalty Company s shareholders of record as of November 3, 1980, who received one Unit in the Trust for each share of Southland Royalty Company common stock held. The Units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Burlington Resources Oil   Gas Company LP ( BROG ), a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is the interest owner for the Waddell
Ranch properties and Riverhill Energy Corporation ( Riverhill Energy ), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Riverhill Capital Corporation ( Riverhill Capital ) and formerly an affiliate of Coastal Management Corporation
( CMC ), is the interest owner for the Texas Royalty properties. BROG currently conducts all field, technical and accounting operations with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties. Riverhill Energy currently conducts the accounting
operations for the Texas Royalty properties.    In February 1997, BROG sold its interest in the Texas Royalty properties to Riverhill Energy.
   The Trustee was advised that in the first quarter of 1998, Schlumberger Technology Corporation ( STC ) acquired all of the
shares of stock of Riverhill Capital. Prior to such acquisition by STC, CMC and Riverhill Energy were wholly owned subsidiaries of Riverhill Capital. The Trustee was further advised that in connection with STC s acquisition of Riverhill
Capital, the shareholders of Riverhill Capital acquired ownership of all of the shares of stock of Riverhill Energy. Thus, the ownership in the Texas Royalty properties referenced above remained in Riverhill Energy, the stock ownership of which was
acquired by the former shareholders of Riverhill Capital.  
      8  

On January 9, 2014, Bank of America, N.A. (as successor to the First National Bank of Fort Worth)
gave notice to Unit holders that it would be resigning as Trustee subject to certain conditions that included the appointment of Southwest Bank, an independent state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort
Worth, Texas ( Southwest Bank ), as successor trustee. At a Special Meeting of Trust Unit holders, the Unit holders approved the appointment of Southwest Bank as successor trustee of the Trust once the resignation of U.S. Trust, Bank of
America Private Wealth Management took effect and also approved certain amendments to the Trust Indenture. The effective date of Bank of America N.A. s resignation and the effective date of Southwest Bank s appointment as successor trustee
was August 29, 2014.   The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that:  

the Trust shall not engage in any business or commercial activity of any kind or acquire any assets other than those initially conveyed to the Trust;    

the Trustee may not sell all or any part of the Royalties unless approved by holders of 75% of all Units outstanding in which case the sale must be for cash and the proceeds promptly distributed;    

the Trustee may establish a cash reserve for the payment of any liability which is contingent or uncertain in amount;        

the Trustee is authorized to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust; and        

the Trustee will make monthly cash distributions to Unit holders (see Note 3).        

2.  
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Accounting   
 The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis:  

Royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust by the interest owners. Royalty income consists of the amounts received by the owners of the interest burdened by
the Royalties from the sale of production less accrued production costs, development and drilling costs, applicable taxes, operating charges and other costs and deductions multiplied by 75% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and 95% in the
case of the Texas Royalty properties.    
      9  

Trust expenses, consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs, recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established out of cash received or borrowed funds for liabilities and
contingencies.        

Distributions to Unit holders are recorded when declared by the Trustee.        

Royalty income is computed separately for each of the conveyances under which the Royalties were conveyed to the Trust. If monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance ( excess costs ), such excess costs
cannot reduce royalty income from other conveyances, but is carried forward with accrued interest to be recovered from future net proceeds of that conveyance.    
 The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America ( GAAP ) because revenues are not accrued in the month of production and certain reserves may be established for contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
and expenses are recorded when liabilities are paid. Amortization of the Royalties calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to trust corpus. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting
permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts .  
  Use of Estimates     The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with the basis of accounting described above requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as of and for the
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from such estimates.     Impairment   
 The Trustee routinely reviews its royalty interests in oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the Trust s royalty interests may not be recoverable, an impairment will be recognized as measured by the amount
by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of these assets, which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows. There was no impairment of the assets as of September 30, 2016.  
      10  

Contingencies   
 Contingencies related to the underlying properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally be reflected by the Trust as reductions to
future royalty income payments to the Trust with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders.     Distributable Income
Per Unit     Basic distributable income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average of Units
outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and equivalent Units outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period
presented. Therefore, basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the same.     New
Accounting Pronouncements     There are no new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on the
Trust s financial statements.     Reclassifications   
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 Condensed Statements of Distributable Income to conform to the 2016 presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on distributable income for the prior periods reported.      

3.  
  NET OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS AND DISTRIBUTION TO UNIT HOLDERS       The amounts to be
distributed to Unit holders ( Monthly Distribution Amounts ) are determined on a monthly basis. The Monthly Distribution Amount is an amount equal to the sum of cash received by the Trustee during a calendar month attributable to the
Royalties, any reduction in cash reserves and any other cash receipts of the Trust, including interest, reduced by the sum of liabilities paid and any increase in cash reserves. If the Monthly Distribution Amount for any monthly period is a negative
number, then the distribution will be zero for such month. To the extent the distribution amount is a negative number, that amount will be carried forward and deducted from future monthly distributions until the cumulative distribution calculation
becomes a positive number, at which time a distribution will be made. Unit holders of record will be entitled to receive the calculated Monthly Distribution Amount for each month on or before 10 business days after the monthly record date, which is
generally the last business day of each calendar month.  
      11  

The cash received by the Trustee consists of the amounts received by owners of the interest
burdened by the Royalties from the sale of production less the sum of applicable taxes, accrued production costs, development and drilling costs, operating charges and other costs and deductions, multiplied by 75% in the case of the Waddell Ranch
properties and 95% in the case of the Texas Royalty properties.      

4.  
  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES       For federal income tax purposes, the Trust constitutes a fixed
investment trust that is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to federal income tax at the trust level. The Unit holders are considered for federal tax purposes to own the Trust s income and principal as though no trust were
in existence. The income of the Trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each Unit holder at the time such income is received or accrued by the Trust and not when distributed by the Trust.  

5.  
  STATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS       All revenues from the Trust are from sources within Texas,
which has no individual income tax. Texas imposes a franchise tax at a rate of .75% on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas franchise tax statutes. Entities subject to tax generally include trusts and most
other types of entities that provide limited liability protection, unless otherwise exempt. Trusts that receive at least 90% of their federal gross income from designated passive sources, including royalties from mineral properties and other
non-operated mineral interest income, and do not receive more than 10% of their income from operating an active trade or business, generally are exempt from the Texas franchise tax as  passive entities.  The Trust has been and expects
to continue to be exempt from Texas franchise tax as a  passive entity.  Because the Trust should be exempt from Texas franchise tax at the Trust level as a passive entity, each Unit holder that is considered a taxable entity under
the Texas franchise tax will generally be required to include its portion of Trust revenues in its own Texas franchise tax computation. This revenue is sourced to Texas under provisions of the Texas Administrative Code providing that such income is
sourced according to the principal place of business of the Trust, which is Texas.    Unit holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding state tax requirements, if any, applicable to such Unit holder s ownership of Trust units.  
      12  

6.  
  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       Contingencies related to the Underlying Properties that
are unfavorably resolved would generally be reflected by the Trust as reductions to future royalty income payments to the Trust with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Unit holders. 

7.  
  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Trust declared a distribution
on October 21, 2016 of $.047121 per Unit payable on November 15, 2016 to Unit holders of record on October 31, 2016.

Item 2.  
  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis        Forward Looking Information   
 Certain information included in this report contains, and other materials filed or to be filed by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as
well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by the Trust) may contain or include, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Such forward looking statements may be or may concern, among other things, capital expenditures, drilling activity, development activities, production efforts and volumes, hydrocarbon prices and
the results thereof, and regulatory matters. Although the Trustee believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and the Trustee can give
no assurance that they will prove correct. There are many factors, none of which are within the Trustee s control, that may cause such expectations not to be realized, including, among other things, factors such as actual oil and gas prices and
the recoverability of reserves, capital expenditures, general economic conditions, actions and policies of petroleum-producing nations and other changes in the domestic and international energy markets. Such forward looking statements generally are
accompanied by words such as  estimate,   expect,   predict,   anticipate,   goal,   should,   assume,   believe,  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future
events or outcomes.     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to $6,554,901 compared to royalty income of $5,882,301 during the third
quarter of 2015. The increase in royalty income is primarily attributable to a reduction of capital expenditures and an increase in oil and gas production, offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, as
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Average oil and gas prices were $42.94 and $2.01 for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 compared to $54.26 and $2.90 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
 Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $796 compared to $26 during the third quarter of 2015. The increase in interest income is
primarily attributable to substantially increased amounts of funds available for investment, primarily the reserve of $950,000 in the Trust account. Total expenses during the third quarter of 2016 amounted to $311,802 compared to $388,407 during the
third quarter of 2015. The decrease in total expenses can be primarily attributed to decreased expense for professional services.  
      14  

These transactions resulted in distributable income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, of $6,243,895 or
$.13 per Unit of beneficial interest. Distributions of $0.040122, $0.047933 and $0.045907 per Unit were made to Unit holders of record as of July 29, 2016, August 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively. For the third quarter of 2015,
distributable income was $5,493,920 or $.12 per Unit of beneficial interest.    Royalty income for the Trust for the third quarter of the calendar year is
associated with actual oil and gas production for the period of May, June and July 2016 from the properties from which the Trust s net overriding royalty interests ( Royalties ) were carved. Oil and gas sales attributable to the
Royalties and the properties from which the Royalties were carved are as follows:      
   The average received price of oil decreased to an average price per barrel of $42.94 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2016,
compared to $54.26 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2015 due to decline in market prices for oil. The Trustee has been advised by ConocoPhillips that for the period of August 1, 1993, through September 30, 2016, the oil from the Waddell Ranch
properties was being sold under a competitive bid to a third party. The average price of gas (including natural gas liquids) decreased from $2.90 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2015 to $2.01 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2016 due to the decrease
in spot prices of natural gas.  
      15  

Since the oil and gas sales attributable to the Royalties are based on an allocation formula that is dependent on
such factors as price and cost (including capital expenditures), the production amounts in the Royalties section of the above table do not provide a meaningful comparison. Oil sales volumes decreased and gas sales volumes decreased from the
Underlying Properties (as defined in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) for the applicable period in 2016 compared to 2015. 
 Capital expenditures for drilling, remedial and maintenance activities on the Waddell Ranch properties during the third quarter of 2016 totaled $851,000 as
compared to $6.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. ConocoPhillips has informed the Trustee that the 2016 capital expenditures budget has been approved at $2.45 million (gross) for the Waddell Ranch properties. The total amount of capital
expenditures for 2015 with regard to the Waddell Ranch properties totaled $27 million (gross).   The Trustee has been advised that there were no workover
wells completed, no new wells completed, no new wells in progress and no workover wells in progress during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 2 workover wells completed, 7 new wells completed, 4 new wells in progress and 0
workover wells in progress for the three months ended September 30, 2015, on the Waddell Ranch properties. There were various facility projects in progress for the third quarter of 2016.  
 Lease operating expenses and property taxes totaled $5.1 million (gross) for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $6.2 million (gross) for the same period
in 2015 on the Waddell Ranch properties due to decreased activities on the Waddell Ranch.     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015     For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, royalty income received by the Trust amounted to $13,704,703 compared to
royalty income of $14,634,316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in royalty income is primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in oil and gas prices for the nine months ending September 30, 2016, as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Average oil and gas prices were $36.57 and $1.97 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 compared to $52.82 and $3.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $1,112 compared to $75 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in
interest income is primarily attributable to substantially increased amounts of funds available for investment, including the reserve for expense. Total expenses during the nine months ending September 30, 2016, amounted to $1,491,649 compared to
$1,435,459 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in total expenses can be primarily attributed to increased professional expenses.  
      16  

The Trust has reserved $950,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 for possible administrative
expenditures which could be needed in the future.    These transactions resulted in distributable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
of $12,214,166, or $.26 per Unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, distributable income was $13,198,932, or $.28 per Unit.    Royalty
income for the Trust for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is associated with actual oil and gas production for the period November 2015 through July 2016 from the properties from which the Royalties were carved. Oil and gas production
attributable to the Royalties and the properties from which the Royalties were carved are as follows:      
   The average received price of oil decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $36.57 per barrel compared
to $52.82 per barrel for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the average price of oil is primarily due to decline in market prices for oil. The decrease in the average price of gas (including natural gas liquids) from $3.04 per Mcf for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $1.97 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily the result of a decrease in the spot prices of natural gas.  
      17  

Since the oil and gas sales volumes attributable to the Royalties are based on an allocation formula that is
dependent on such factors as price and cost (including capital expenditures), the production amounts in the Royalties section of the above table do not provide a meaningful comparison. Both oil and gas sales volumes from the properties from which
the Royalties are carved have increased for the applicable period of 2016 compared to 2015.    Capital expenditures for the Waddell Ranch properties for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $4.0 million (gross) compared to $20.1 million (gross) to the Trust for the same period in 2015. ConocoPhillips has previously advised the Trust that the 2016 capital expenditures budget for the
Waddell Ranch properties is $2.45 million (gross).    The Trustee has been advised that no workover wells were completed and no new wells were completed (no
vertical, no horizontal) on the Waddell Ranch properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 12 workover wells completed and 10 new wells (9 vertical, 1 horizontal) completed on the Waddell Ranch properties during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   Lease operating expenses and property taxes totaled $17.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in lease operating expense is primarily attributable to decreased spending on facilities and maintenance.  
  Calculation of Royalty Income     The Trust s royalty
income is computed as a percentage of the net profit from the operation of the properties in which the Trust owns net overriding royalty interests. These percentages of net profits are 75% and 95% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and the
Texas Royalty properties, respectively. Royalty income received by the Trust for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were computed as shown in the table below:  
      18

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 A disclosure of critical accounting policies and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Trust s financial statements
is included in Item 7 of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Distributable Income Per Unit      Basic distributable
income per Unit is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average of Units outstanding. Distributable income per Unit assuming dilution is computed by dividing distributable income by the weighted average number of Units and
equivalent Units outstanding. The Trust had no equivalent Units outstanding for any period presented. Therefore, basic distributable income per Unit and distributable income per Unit assuming dilution are the same.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements     There are no new
accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on the Trust s financial statements.      

Item 3.  
  Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk       There have been no material changes in the
Trust s market risk, as disclosed in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.      

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures       On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission issued an updated version of its  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  (the  2013 Framework ) which helps organizations design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify
their use and application. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 based on the criteria established in the 2013 Framework. Based upon that evaluation, the Trustee concluded that the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in
the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In its evaluation of
 
      20  

disclosure controls and procedures, the Trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by Burlington Resources Oil   Gas Company LP, the owner of the Waddell
Ranch properties, and Riverhill Energy Corporation, the owner of the Texas Royalty properties. There has not been any change in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.  
      21
