  (A Development Stage Company)  

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 For the Three Months Ended October 31, 2016 

1. NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS  

The Company is a development stage company, which was incorporated
in the State of Nevada, United States of America on August 23, 2006. The Company intends to commence operations in health and beauty
care through the utilization of the web. 

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis. The Company has accumulated a deficit of $92,415 since inception and has yet to achieve profitable operations and further
losses are anticipated in the development of its business, raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable
operations in the future and or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from
normal business operations when they come due. Management plans to continue to provide for its working capital needs by seeking
loans from its shareholder. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification
of assets, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. 

The company's year-end is July 31. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because a precise determination of many assets and
liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use
of estimates, which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. 

The financial statements have, in management's opinion, been properly
prepared within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

 Cash equivalents comprise certain highly liquid instruments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased. As at October 31, 2016, there were Cash and Cash Equivalents equal to $0. 

Development Stage Company  

 The Company complies with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) Topic 915 Development Stage Entities and the Securities and Exchange Commission Exchange Act 7 for its characterization of
the Company as development stage. 

Impairment of Long Lived Assets  

 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with
ASC Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long- lived Assets . Under ASC Topic 360, long-lived assets
are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
An impairment charge is recognized or the amount, if any, which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

 The Company is located and operating outside of the United States
of America. It maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows: 

At the transaction date, each asset, liability, revenue, and expense
is translated into U.S. dollars by the use of exchange rates in effect at that date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities
are remeasured by using the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included
in operations. 

The Company's currency exposure is insignificant and immaterial
and we do not use derivative instruments to reduce its potential exposure to foreign currency risk. 

Financial Instruments  

 The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments consisting
of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest,
currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. 

Income Taxes  

 The Company uses the assets and liability method of accounting for
income taxes in accordance with FASB Topic 740  Income Taxes .  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share  

 In accordance with FASB Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share', the
basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic net loss per common share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As at October 31, 2016, diluted net loss per share
is equivalent to basic net loss per share. 

Stock Based Compensation  

 The Company accounts for stock options and similar equity instruments
issued in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation.  Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to
stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the expected
vesting period. Transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for the issuance of equity instruments are
accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. ASC Topic 718- Compensation requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather
than as a reduction of taxes paid. 

The Company did not grant any stock options during the period ended
October 31, 2016. 

Comprehensive Income  

 The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 130 (SFAS 130), Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income,
its components and accumulated balances. The Company is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders' Equity. 
Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  

The Company has no elements of  other comprehensive income 
during the period ended October 31, 2016. 

Advertising Expenses  

 There is no advertising expense incurred by the company during the
period ended October 31, 2016. 

New Accounting Standards  

 Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet
effective accounting standards if currently adopted could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 

3. CAPITAL STOCK  

 On July 15, 2007, the Company issued 14,000,000 common shares at
$0.001 per share to the sole director of the Company for total proceeds of $2,000. 

In May 2008, the Company issued 21,000,000 common shares at $0.001
per share to subscribers for total proceeds of $30,000. 

On February 25, 2010, the Company amended its Articles of incorporation
and authorized 125,000,000 shares of common stock, at $.001 par value of which 35,000,000 were issued and outstanding as of
October 31, 2012. 

On October 31, 2010, the Stockholder's of the Company authorized
the Forward Stock Split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock on a seven for one (7:1) basis. The Forward Stock Split became
effective on October 31, 2010. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the Company increased its issued and outstanding shares
of the Common Stock to 35,000,000 from 5,000,000. 

In May 2012, the Company subscribed 500,000 restricted common shares
at $0.20 per share to a shareholder for a subscription receivable of $100,000. 

In July 2012, the Company issued 500,000 common shares at  0.001
per share to subscribers for total receivable proceeds of $500. 

The number of shares outstanding of the Registrant's common stock,
par value $.001 per share, at October 31, 2016 is 35,500,000. 

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

 A series of shareholder loans were made from August 23, 2006 to
October 31, 2015 totaling $13,425. A balance of $13,425 is still outstanding as of October 31, 2016, without interest and
fixed term of repayment. The loan is due at demand.

COMPANY OVERVIEW  

 Emo Capital Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August
23, 2006. Emo has changed its business focus to the health and beauty care thru utilization of the web. 

 The Company s acquisition of the ME4Free business is a division
of the Company that sells online non-prescription herbal products. The initial products to be manufactured and distributed are
various capsules, made from all natural ingredients, to maximize sexual health by boosting testosterone levels. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Company experienced general and administration expenses of $nil
and $nil for the three-month period ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 respective. 

For the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, the company experienced
a net loss of $nil, and had experienced a total deficit of $92,415 since inception. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 During the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, the Company
satisfied its working capital needs by using loans from the Company's officer. As of October 31, 2016 the Company has cash on hand
in the amount of $nil. Management does not expect that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations
for the next twelve-month period. In the event that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors
have agreed to advance us sufficient capital to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders,
but there are no agreements or understandings in place currently. 

We believe we will require additional funding to expand our business
and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the
sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. In the event we are
not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director.
