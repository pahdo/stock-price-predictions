  Financial Statements  
   
 The accompanying unaudited balance sheet of Westgate Acquisitions Corporation at September 30, 2016, related unaudited statements of operations and statements of cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared by management in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the company   s December 31, 2015 Form 10-K.  Operating results for the period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 or any other subsequent period.

 Notes to Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
 (Unaudited) 
   
  NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 
   
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. 
   
  NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 
   
 In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 
   
 The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
           NOTE 3     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Item 2.  
   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  
   
 Westgate Acquisitions Corporation (     Westgate      or the      company     ) is an exploration stage company reflecting its acquisition of certain mining and/or mineral claims. The company intends to implement its initial exploration program to identify a mineral deposit as necessary funding is secured. Ongoing operating expenses, including preparing and filing this and other reports with the SEC, have historically been paid for by advances from stockholders.  We anticipate that necessary future funds for operations and to maintain corporate viability will most likely be provided by officers, directors or principal stockholders or from private sales of securities, either debt or equity.  However, there is no assurance that we will be able to realize such funds on terms favorable to the company, or at all. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Westgate has not recorded revenues since inception.  During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 (     third quarter     ), we incurred a net loss of $9,030 compared to an $11,179 loss during the comparable 2015 third quarter.  The decreased net loss was due primarily to the decrease in general and administrative expenses from $8,160 for the third quarter of 2015 to $5,751 for the third quarter 2016, which is attributed to the decrease in professional and accounting expenses. The decreased net loss was partially offset by the increase in interest expense from $3,019 for the third quarter of 2015 to $3,279 for the third quarter 2016, due to interest on increased loans from stockholders. 
   
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (     first nine months     ), we incurred a net loss of $32,723 compared to a $39,343 loss during the comparable first nine months of 2015.  The decreased net loss was also due primarily to the decrease in general and administrative expenses from $30,408 for the first nine months of 2015 to $23,117 for the first nine months of 2016, reflecting the decrease in professional and accounting expenses. The decreased net loss was partially offset by the increase in interest expense from $8,935 for the first nine months of 2015 to $9,606 for the first nine months of 2016, attributed to interest on increased loans from stockholders. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had total assets consisting solely of cash of $256, compared to cash of $3,778 at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in cash is attributed to the payment of ongoing operating expenses during the first nine months of 2016. Company funds have been derived from stockholder loans. 
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had total current liabilities of $219,219, compared to current liabilities of $194,518 at December 31, 2015.  The increase in liabilities is primarily attributed to ongoing professional fees and additional loans from stockholders to pay for expenses. At September 30, 2016 we had a note payable - related party of $146,184, compared to $131,944 at December 31, 2015, which increase represents additional loans from stockholders.  Accrued interest on the related party note payable increased from $52,554 at December 31, 2015 to $62,160 at September 30, 2016, attributed to ongoing interest on the increase in debt.  Also, accounts payable of $10,020 at December 31, 2015 increased slightly to $10,875 at September 30, 2016. Expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2015 and first nine months of 2016 have been paid for by stockholders.   
   
 Because of our limited cash reserves and no operating revenues, we expect that ongoing expenses will continue to be paid by stockholder loans until such time as we can successfully find an acceptable source of outside funding. There is no assurance that our stockholders will continue indefinitely to provide additional funds or continue to pay our expenses.  Until we can begin to realize revenue from operations, it is likely that the only other source of funding future operations will be through the private sale of securities, either equity or debt.   
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had a stockholders    deficit of $218,963 compared to a stockholders' deficit of $190,740 at December 31, 2015.  This increase in stockholders' deficit is attributed to ongoing business expenses, particularly legal and accounting costs, and increases in notes payable-related party and the interest thereon reflecting additional loans from stockholders.  
   
 We believe that our current cash and additional loans from stockholders will be sufficient to carry on general operations for the next three months. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds, most likely from the sale of securities or from stockholder loans, to be able to execute phase one of our exploration program. We may not be successful in our efforts to obtain equity financing to carry out our business plan and there is doubt regarding our ability to complete our planned exploration program.  We estimate that in addition to cash on hand, we will require an additional $25,000 to execute phase one of our exploration program through the end of 2016. 
   
  Plan of Operation  
   
 We have acquired for stock certain mining and/or mineral claims and/or leases located in Lincoln County, New Mexico. Accordingly, we are considered an exploration stage mining company, which is defined as a company engaged in the search for mineral deposits or reserves of precious and base metal targets, which are not in either the development or production stage. We have no known mineral reserves on our properties and our proposed preliminary studies of the Claims is intended to be exploratory in nature.  
   
 Our current plan of operation reflects our objectives and anticipated growth for the next 12 months and beyond, identifying cash requirements to fulfill our business objectives.  We will need to raise additional funds during the next 12 months to complete our exploration commitments and to pay for general business and operating expenses. We believe current funds and potential loans from stockholders are sufficient to cover general and administrative expenses for at least the next three months.  However, we estimate that we will need additional funds to complete requisite initial geological reports as well as up to an additional $60,000 during the next twelve months to complete the second phase of exploration and to commence an exploratory drilling program.  Management plans to explore a possible private placement of our securities and/or debt financing to raise the additional fund, although no definitive plan has been formulated and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the necessary funds. 
   
 If we are able to complete our planned initial exploration programs and successfully identify a mineral deposit, we will need substantial additional funds for drilling and engineering studies to determine whether any identified mineral deposit is commercially viable. Management expects that due to the anticipated expense of a drilling program we may need to secure a strategic partner to proceed. If we are unable to raise additional funds for this work or secure a strategic partner, we would be unable to proceed, even if a mineral deposit is discovered and is believed to be commercially viable. 
   
 Our business plan calls for exploration on our properties to be conducted as Phase One and Phase Two. Total exploration expenditures for Phase One and Phase Two are expected to be approximately $40,000. Management will assess each phase of our proposed exploration to determine whether the results warrant further work. If exploration results on the initial phases do not warrant drilling or further exploration, we will most likely suspend operations on the property. In that event, we would need to seek additional exploration properties and additional funding with which to conduct the work. If we are unable to obtain additional financing or additional properties, we may not be able to continue active business operations. 
   
 We do not anticipate making any major equipment purchasers or significant capital expenditures in the immediate future unless we have the necessary funds. We do not have employees and do not expect to add employees over the next 12 months, except for part-time clerical assistance on an as-needed basis and possibly engaging outside advisors or consultants as requisite funds are available. We anticipate that our current management team will satisfy our everyday operating requirements for the foreseeable future. 
   
 Due to our limited cash reserves, it may be necessary for officers, directors or stockholders to advance funds and we will most likely accrue expenses until a funding can be accomplished. Management intends to hold expenses to a minimum and to obtain services on a contingency basis when possible.  Further, we expect directors to defer any compensation until such time as we have sufficient funds.  We have not yet entered into any arrangements or definitive agreements to use outside advisors or consultants or to raise any capital.   
 Because we will most likely need to obtain outside financing, possibly the only method available would be the private sale of securities. It is unlikely that we could make a public sale of securities or be able to borrow any significant sum from either a commercial or private lender.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary additional funding when and if needed, or that such funding, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. 
   
  Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements  
   
 This report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as    may,       will       should,     expect,   intend,   plan,  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential,   continue,  or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.  Although forward-looking statement, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.  Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. We believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, however such expectations cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. 
   
  Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
   
 This item is not required for a smaller reporting company. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives.  Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment.  Based on the evaluation described above, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a lack of adequate segregation of duties and the absence of an audit committee. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .  Management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Based on its evaluation, management, including the chief executive officer and principal accounting officer, has concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
