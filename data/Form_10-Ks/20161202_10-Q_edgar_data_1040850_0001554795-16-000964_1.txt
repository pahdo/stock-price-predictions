AGRITEK HOLDINGS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements  

  June 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

Note 1 -  Organization   

Business   

Agritek Holdings, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Agritek ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Agritek Venture Holdings, Inc. ( AVHI ), acquires and leases
real estate to licensed marijuana operators, including providing complete turnkey growing space and related facilities to
licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners. Additionally, the Company offers a variety of services and product lines
to the medicinal marijuana sector including the distribution of hemp based nutritional products and a line of innovative solutions
for electronically processing merchant transactions. 

On May 23, 2016, the Company filed a certificate
of amendment (a  Certificate of Amendment ), increasing the authorized capital of the Company to 1,001,000,000 shares
of capital stock; consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock par value $0.0001 and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.01. The majority of the Company s shareholders consented to the Certificate of Amendment increasing the authorized
capital. 

Note 2    Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation and Principles
of Consolidation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included
in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Interim results
of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year.
Certain amounts from the 2015 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements of the Company  include the consolidated accounts of Agritek and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, AVHI and Prohibition Products, Inc. ( PPI ). PPI, a Florida corporation, was originally formed on July
1, 2013 as The American Hemp Trading Company, Inc. ( AHTC ) and on August 27, 2014, AHTC changed its name to PPI. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company records accounts receivable from
amounts due from its customers upon the shipment of products. The allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses
charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely.
The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based
on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience. While management uses the best information available
to make its evaluations, this estimate is susceptible to significant change in the near term. As of June 30, 2016, based on the
above criteria, the Company has a full allowance for doubtful accounts of $43,408. 

Inventory   

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or
market value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving
inventory is made based on management analysis or inventory levels and future sales forecasts. 

Deferred Financing Costs   

The costs related to the issuance of debt
are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method through the maturities of the related debt. 

Derivative Financial Instruments   

The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments, including
stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at
its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

For option-based simple derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount   

The Company may record debt issue costs and/or
debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt.  These costs may be paid in the form of
cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of
the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

Original Issue Discount   

For certain convertible debt issued, the Company
may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount.  The original issue discount would be recorded to debt discount,
reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. 

Marketable Securities   

The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
in the period earned or incurred. 

Investment of Non-Marketable Securities   

The Company s investment in non-marketable
securities consist of cash investments in a less than 10% interest in two privately held companies that provide merchant processing
services. Petrogress, Inc. (formerly 800 Commerce, Inc. and a subsidiary of the Company through its  deconsolidation in May
2012) derived substantially all of its  revenues, through April 2015, from these privately held companies. 

Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
and except for land, depreciation is provided by use of a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
Company reviews property and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts of assets may not be recoverable. In November 2015, the Company was made aware that the land transaction regarding 80 acres
in Pueblo County, Colorado, may not have been properly deeded to the Company. The company was a party to the land purchase,
however, it was recently discovered, and the second party to the land contract never filed the original quit claim deed on behalf
of the Company, even though a copy of the notarized quit claim deed was sent to the Company. To date, the Company has paid a total
of $47,438 ($36,000 at closing) and is on the deed of trust of the property with a remaining note balance of approximately $75,000
held by the original owner. Accordingly, until the deed is properly recorded, the Company reduced the remaining balance of the
note payable for the acquisition of the land of $74,313 and recorded a reserve allowance for the remaining balance of the asset
of $54,490. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:  

Furniture and equipment 
     5 years  

The Company's property and equipment consisted of the following
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Depreciation expense of $761 and $1,452 was
recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $936 and $1,383 for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets   

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on events and
changes in circumstances on June 30, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying amount of goodwill initially recorded from an acquisition
in September 2014, and determined that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and accordingly recognized an impairment loss
of $192,849 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the month in which products are shipped or commissions are earned. No revenue has
been recognized from leasing arrangements to date. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined under
a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). 

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers
the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity
to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed in
the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term
maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.  The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative
of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects,
calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax
asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. Interest
and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor paid,
any interest or penalties. 

Uncertain tax positions are measured and recorded
by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be
recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company s tax years subsequent to 2005 remain subject to examination by federal
and state tax jurisdictions. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share are computed in accordance
with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss), after
deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities, if any, outstanding during the period. As of June 30,
2016 there were warrants and options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock and the Company s outstanding convertible
debt is convertible into approximately 536,836,311 shares of common stock. These amounts are not included in the computation of
dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive. 

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation    

The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 

For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, the Company recorded stock and warrant based compensation of $0 and $2,371, respectively compared to $438,250 and $454,734
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. (See Note 8). 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Advertising   

The Company records advertising costs as incurred.
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2016, advertising expense was $2,941 and $6,000, respectively, compared to $30,212
and $37,754 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. 

Note 3    Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

Note 4    Impairment of Goodwill   

On September 12, 2014,
the Company completed the asset acquisition of the entire line of products, technology and customers of Dry Vapes Holdings,
Inc. 

The Company recorded the acquisition using
the acquisition method, which requires the Company to record the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (if any) at their acquisition
date fair values and record any excess of the consideration given, including liabilities assumed (if any) over the fair value of
the assets acquired as goodwill. The acquired assets consisted solely of inventory. The transaction resulted in the Company recording
goodwill of $192,849. Based on events and changes in circumstances on June 30, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying amount of
the goodwill, and determined that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $192,849
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 

Note 5    Sales Concentration and
Concentration of Credit Risk   

Cash   

Financial   instruments   that   potentially   subject   the   Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains cash balances at one financial institution,
which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The FDIC insured institution insures
up to $250,000 on account balances. 

Sales and Accounts Receivable   

Following is a summary of customers who accounted
for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company s revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the accounts
receivable balance as of June 30, 2016: 

Purchases   

For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the
Company s purchases were from one vendor. 

Note 6    Convertible Debt and Note
Payable   

2014 Convertible Note   

In January 2014, the Company entered into a
Secured Promissory Note for $1,660,000 (the  2014 Company Note ) to Tonaquint, Inc. ( Tonaquint ) which
includes a purchase price of $1,500,000 and transaction costs of $160,000. On January 31, 2014, the Company received $300,000 of
the purchase price. Tonaquint also issued to the Company 6 secured promissory notes, each in the amount of $200,000 (the 2014  Investor

As of the date of the DLF Agreement, the Company
and Tonaquint agreed to offset the remaining unpaid principal balance of the Investor Notes of $176,642 to the Note. The parties
further agreed that accrued and unpaid interest of $316,723 would be added to the Note and each party confirmed that the Note balance

The debt issuance costs included in the 2015
Convertible Notes were amortized over the earlier of the terms of the Note or any redemptions and have been expensed as debt issuance
costs (included in interest expense). 

Among other terms the 2015 Notes are due nine
to twelve months from their issuance date, bearing interest at 8% per annum, payable in cash or shares at a conversion price (the
 Conversion Price ) for each share of common stock equal to 39% - 42% of the average of the lowest three trading prices
(as defined in the note agreements) per share of the Company s common stock for the ten to eighteen trading days immediately
preceding the date of conversion. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, as defined in the 2015 Convertible Notes, the Company
was required to pay interest at 22% per annum and the holders could at their option declare a Note, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the 2015 Convertible Notes provide for adjustments for dividends payable
other than in shares of common stock, for reclassification, exchange or substitution of the common stock for another security or
securities of the Company or pursuant to a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets, where there is a change in
control of the Company. 

The Company determined that the conversion
feature of the 2015 Convertible Notes represent an embedded derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of
shares upon conversion. Accordingly, the 2015 Convertible Notes were not considered to be conventional debt under ASC 815-40 (formerly
EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company s Own Stock)
and the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly,
the fair value of these derivative instruments being recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding
amount recorded as a discount to each Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of
the Notes. The change in the fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet.
The embedded feature included in the 2015 Convertible Notes resulted in an initial debt discount of $211,750, an initial derivative
liability expense of $71,761 and an initial derivative liability of $283,511. 

2016 Convertible Notes   

On January 19, 2016, the Company completed
the closing of a private placement financing transaction with LG, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  LG Purchase

in the aggregate principal amount of $76,080, and delivered on January 31, 2016, gross proceeds of $62,500 excluding transaction
costs, fees, and expenses.

On March 23, 2016, the Company completed the
closing of a private placement financing transaction with Cerebrus, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Cerebrus

Debenture ) in the aggregate principal amount of $22,000, and delivered on March 31, 2016, gross proceeds of $20,000 excluding

On April 15, 2016, the Company completed the

Agreement ). Pursuant to the LG Purchase Agreement, LG purchased an 8% Convertible Debenture (the  LG Debenture )
in the aggregate principal amount of $65,625, and delivered on April 15, 2016, gross proceeds of $62,500 excluding transaction
costs, fees, and expenses. 

Principal and interest on the above four convertible
debentures is due and payable one year from their respective funding date, and the LG and Cerebrus Debentures are convertible into
shares of the Company s common stock at any time at the discretion of LG and Cerebrus, respectively, at a VCP. The VCP is
calculated as the lowest trading price during the eighteen (18) trading days immediately prior to the conversion date multiplied
by fifty eight percent (58%), representing a forty two percent (42%) discount. 

The Company may prepay the LG and/or the Cerebrus
Debentures, subject to prior notice to the holder within an initial 30 day period after issuance, by paying an amount equal to
118% multiplied by the amount that the Company is prepaying. For each additional 30 day period the amount being prepaid is multiplied
by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 148% on the 180 th  day from issuance. Beginning on the 180 th  day
after the issuance of the Debentures, the Company is not permitted to prepay the Debenture, so long as the Debenture is still outstanding,
unless the Company and the holder agree otherwise in writing. 

The Company determined that the conversion
feature of the 2016 Convertible Notes represent an embedded derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of
shares upon conversion. Accordingly, the 2016 Convertible Notes were not considered to be conventional debt under ASC 815-40 (formerly
EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company s Own Stock)
and the embedded conversion feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly,
the fair value of these derivative instruments being recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding
amount recorded as a discount to each Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of
the Notes. The change in the fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet.
The embedded feature included in the 2016 Convertible Notes resulted in an initial debt discount of $566,343, an initial derivative
liability expense of $426,126 and an initial derivative liability of $992,469. 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company revalued the
embedded conversion feature of the 2015 and 2016 Convertible Notes. The fair value of the 2015 and 2016 Convertible Notes was calculated
at June 30, 2016 based on the Black Scholes method consistent with the terms of the related debt. 

A summary of the derivative liability balance
as of June 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The fair value at the commitment date for the
2016 Convertible Notes and the re-measurement dates for the Company s derivative liabilities were based upon the following

On March 18, 2014, in conjunction with the
land purchase of 80 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado, the Company paid $36,000 cash and entered into a promissory note in the amount
of $85,750. The promissory note is being amortized on the basis of five (5) years, with principal payments of $17,150 plus interest
at 3.5% due annually on December 1 of each year. Payments begin December 1, 2014, and shall be due on the first day of each succeeding
December, with any balance of principal and accrued interest due December 1, 2020. On March 4, 2015, and May 4, 2015, the Company

including a past due amount of $5,713 of the December 2014 amount due. In November 2015, the Company was made aware that the land
transaction regarding 80 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado, may not have been properly deeded to the Company. The company
was a party to the land purchase, however, it was then discovered the second party to the land contract never filed the original
quit claim deed on behalf of the Company, even though a copy of the notarized quit claim deed was sent to the Company. To date,
the Company has paid a total of $47,438 ($36,000 at closing) and is on the deed of trust of the property. Accordingly, until the
deed is properly recorded, the Company reduced the remaining balance of the note payable for the acquisition of the land of $74,313
and during the year ended December 31, 2015, recorded a reserve allowance for the remaining balance of the asset of $54,490.

deficit of $14,323,400   and working capital deficit of $1,561,989. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.   The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

LG Capital   

On July 14, 2016, the Company completed the
closing of a private placement financing transaction with LG, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  LG Purchase
Agreement ). Pursuant to the LG Purchase Agreement, LG purchased an 8% Convertible Debenture (the  LG Debenture )
in the aggregate principal amount of $65,625, and delivered on April 15, 2016, gross proceeds of $62,500 excluding transaction
costs, fees, and expenses. 

Principal and interest on the above is due
and payable one year from the funding date, and is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at any time at the
discretion of LG at a VCP. The VCP is calculated as the lowest trading price during the eighteen (18) trading days immediately
prior to the conversion date multiplied by fifty eight percent (58%), representing a forty two percent (42%) discount. 

The Company may prepay the LG Debenture, subject
to prior notice to the holder within an initial 30 day period after issuance, by paying an amount equal to 118% multiplied by the
amount that the Company is prepaying. For each additional 30 day period the amount being prepaid is multiplied by an additional
6%, up to a maximum of 148% on the 180 th  day from issuance. Beginning on the 180 th  day after the
issuance of the Debentures, the Company is not permitted to prepay the Debenture, so long as the Debenture is still outstanding,
unless the Company and the holder agree otherwise in writing. 

St. George Investments, LLC.   

On October 31, 2016, the Company
entered into a Convertible Promissory Note ( St. George 2016 Notes ) for $555,000 to St. George Investments,
LLC., ( St. George ) which includes a purchase price of $500,000 and transaction costs of $5,000 and OID interest
of $50,000. On October 31, 2016, the Company received $100,000 and recorded $115,000 as convertible note payable, including
$5,000 of transaction costs and $10,000 OID interest. St. George also issued to the Company eight  secured
promissory notes, each in the amount of $50,000. All or any portion of the outstanding balance of the St. George 2016 Notes
may be prepaid, without penalty, along with accrued but unpaid interest at any time prior to maturity. The Company has no
obligation to pay St. George any amounts on the unfunded portion of the St. George 2016 Notes. The St. George 2016 Note bears
interest at 10% per annum (increases to 22% per annum upon an event of default) and is convertible into shares of
the Company s common stock at St. George s option at a price of $0.05 per share. 

Beginning on the date that is six (6) months
after the later of (i) the Issuance Date, and (ii) the date the Initial Cash Purchase Price is paid to the Company (the  Initial
Installment Date ), and on each applicable Installment Date thereafter, the Company is to pay the Holder, the applicable
Installment Amount due on such date. Five Installment Amounts of $111,000 plus the sum of any accrued and unpaid interest, fees,
costs or charges may be made (a) in cash (a  Company Redemption ), (b) by converting such Installment Amount into shares
of Common Stock (a  Company Conversion ), or (c) by any combination of a Company Conversion and a Company Redemption
so long as the entire amount of such Installment Amount due shall be converted and/or redeemed by the Company on the applicable
Installment Date. The St. George 2016 Note matures fifteen months after the Issuance Date. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following is management s discussion
and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management.
This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words  believes,   anticipates,   may, 
 will,   should,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   continue, 
and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports
or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes
to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The independent auditor s report on our
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2015 includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph
that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to the factors
prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note 10 to the unaudited condensed financial statements. 

While our financial statements are presented
on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our auditor has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern.

For the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2015

and $13,981 (6 months). 

Interest expense for each of the periods is
as follows:    

Capital
Resources and Liquidity   

Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to
generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $0, a decrease of $11,548, from $11,548 as of December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, we had current liabilities of $1,576,531
compared to current assets of $14,542 which resulted in working capital deficit of $1,561,989. The current liabilities are comprised
of accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible debt and notes payable. 

Operating Activities  

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net
cash used in operating activities was $185,743 compared to $353,197 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The Company had a net
loss $876,519 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $1,605,302 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 

The net loss for the six months ended June
30, 2016 of $876,519 and a gain on debt settlements of $84,057 were impacted by non-cash expenses for the fair value of the derivative
liability of $335,884, amortization of discounts on convertible notes of $250,033, warrants previously issued (now vested) for
services of $2,371 and depreciation expense of $1,452. Changes in operating assets and liabilities that reduced cash used in operating
activities included an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $109,708, interest payable of $37,938, deferred compensation
of $3,233 and tenant deposits of $2,400. 

The net loss for the six months ended June
30, 2015 of $1,605,302 was impacted by the impairment of goodwill of $192,849, noncash interest expense of $236,305 for excess
value of common stock issued for convertible notes payable, the amortization of discounts on convertible notes of $73,410, amortization
of deferred stock compensation of $118,434, stock based compensation of $336,300, reserve for inventory loss of $32,529, change
in fair values of derivative liabilities of $7,603 and the amortization of deferred financing fees of $5,232 related to the convertible
promissory notes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities that reduced cash used in operating activities included an increase
in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $284,098, an increase in deferred compensation of $4,434, a decrease in prepaid assets
and other of $44,935 and a decrease in inventory of $4,422. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilizing cash was the
result of the return of $90,000 on tenant deposits. 

Investing Activities  

During the six months ended June 30, 2016,
net cash used in investing activities was $1,665 compared to $34,610 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The 2016 period was
the result of a fixed asset purchase. The 2015 period was the result of advances to a related party of $34,610. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was
$175,860   and $270,954 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company received proceeds of $170,000 from the issuance of convertible notes, bank overdraft
of $462 and proceeds from related party notes of $5,398. 

The 2015 activity was comprised of 
 proceeds received related to the Tonaquint notes receivable of $82,391, proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory
notes of $200,000 and the payments made on notes payable of $11,437.  

We do not have cash and cash equivalents on
hand to meet our obligations. We presently maintain our daily operations and capital needs through the sale of our products and
financings available to us from our lender. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2016, a net loss and net cash used
in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting to produce sufficient
revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes
in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances
to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its
business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We have identified the following policies
below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application of the following
accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve making
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of
operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and the best
estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the
following paragraphs. 

Basis of Presentation and Principles
of Consolidation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included
in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Interim results
of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year.
Certain amounts from the 2015 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period. 

The condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements of the Company  include the consolidated accounts of Agritek and its wholly owned
subsidiaries AVHI and Prohibition Products, Inc. ( PPI ). PPI, a Florida corporation, was originally formed on July
1, 2013 as The American Hemp Trading Company, Inc. ( AHTC ) and on August 27, 2014, AHTC changed its name to PPI. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company records accounts receivable from
amounts due from its customers upon the shipment of products. The allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses
charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely.
The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based
on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience. While management uses the best information available
to make its evaluations, this estimate is susceptible to significant change in the near term. As of June 30, 2016, based on the
above criteria, the Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $44,068. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the month in which products are shipped or commissions are earned. No revenue has
been recognized from leasing arrangements to date. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined under
a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). 

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market approach ). The Company also considers
the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal activity
to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect
the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that
applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed in
the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, note payable and convertible debt.
The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term
maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.  The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative
of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

Earnings (loss) per share are computed in accordance
with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss), after
deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities, if any, outstanding during the period. As of June 30,
2016 there were warrants and options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock and the Company s outstanding convertible
debt is convertible into approximately 536,836,311 shares of common stock These amounts are not included in the computation of
dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive. 

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation   

The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016 due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional
personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations
of the Company, we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation req uired
by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Convertible
Debenture Proceeds   

On
July 14, 2016, the Company completed the closing of a private placement financing transaction with LG, pursuant to a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the  LG Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant to the LG Purchase Agreement, LG purchased an 8% Convertible
Debenture (the  LG Debenture ) in the aggregate principal amount of $65,625, and delivered on April 15, 2016, gross
proceeds of $62,500 excluding transaction costs, fees, and expenses.  

Principal
and interest on the above is due and payable one year from the funding date, and is convertible into shares of the Company s
common stock at any time at the discretion of LG at a VCP. The VCP is calculated as the lowest trading price during the eighteen
(18) trading days immediately prior to the conversion date multiplied by fifty eight percent (58%), representing a forty two percent
(42%) discount.  

The
Company may prepay the LG Debenture, subject to prior notice to the holder within an initial 30 day period after issuance, by
paying an amount equal to 118% multiplied by the amount that the Company is prepaying. For each additional 30 day period the amount
being prepaid is multiplied by an additional 6%, up to a maximum of 148% on the 180 th  day from issuance. Beginning
on the 180 th  day after the issuance of the Debentures, the  
Company is not permitted to prepay the Debenture, so long as the Debenture is still outstanding, unless the Company and the holder
agree otherwise in writing.  

On October 31, 2016, the Company
entered into a Convertible Promissory Note ( St. George 2016 Notes ) for $555,000 to St. George Investments,
LLC., ( St. George ) which includes a purchase price of $500,000 and transaction costs of $5,000 and OID interest
of $50,000. On October 31, 2016, the Company received $100,000 and recorded $115,000 as convertible note payable, including
$5,000 of transaction costs and $10,000 OID interest. St. George also issued to the Company  eight secured promissory notes,
each in the amount of $50,000. All or any portion of the outstanding balance of the St. George 2016 Notes may be prepaid,
without penalty, along with accrued but unpaid interest at any time prior to maturity. The Company has no obligation to pay
St. George any amounts on the unfunded portion of the St. George 2016 Notes. The St. George 2016 Note bears interest at 10%
per annum (increases to 22% per annum upon an event of default) and is convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock at St. George s option at a price of $0.05 per share.
