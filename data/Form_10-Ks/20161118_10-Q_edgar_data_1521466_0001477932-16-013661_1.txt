     Table of Contents          APEX 2, Inc.     Notes to Condensed Unaudited Financial Statements        NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      APEX 2, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 17, 2011 and has been inactive since inception. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business.      NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Basis of Presentation       The accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below, these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K annual report for year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Interim results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year.       Accounting Method      The Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on December 31.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.                  6       
     Table of Contents          Income Taxes      Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax   reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.       Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share      ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share , specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. ASC Topic 260 requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share.      Basic net loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company and losses from operations.       Impact of New Accounting Standards      The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.      NOTE 3: GOING CONCERN      As shown in the accompanying balance sheet, the Company has assets of $20,189 and an accumulated deficit of $74,219 at September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on ability to identify a target acquisition. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.       NOTE 4: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      Since inception, the Company s former officer and director advanced a total $40,137 and the present officer advanced the Company $32,871, both of which remain unpaid as of September 30, 2016. These amounts are non-interest bearing and due on demand.      NOTE 5: STOCKHOLDER S DEFICIT      On May 17, 2011 the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock (founder s shares) valued at $1,000 with a par value of $0.0001 per share.     During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 6,800 shares of common stock to 40 individuals at $3.00 per share for aggregate proceed of $20,400.                  7       
     Table of Contents           Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are forward-looking statements. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   approximate  or  continue,  or the negative thereof. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are the following: the Company s ability to obtain necessary capital, the Company s ability to meet anticipated development timelines, the Company s ability to protect its proprietary technology and knowhow;, the Company s ability to successfully consummate future acquisitions and such other risk factors identified from time to time in the Company s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those filed with this Form 10-Q quarterly report. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.      Overview      The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target business.     The Company has not restricted its search for any specific kind of businesses, and it may acquire a business which is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in essentially any stage of its business life. It is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer.     In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity.                  8       
     Table of Contents         It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may agree   to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the Company's securities may depress the market value of the Company's securities in the future if such a market develops, of which there is no assurance.     The Company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations with a target company will likely focus on the percentage of the Company which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company's shareholders at such time.     The Company will engage in very limited activities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholder.      Results of Operations      The Company has not generated any revenue since inception. Expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $14,154 and $21,832, respectively while the expenses for the same periods in 2015 were $3,250 and $7,750, respectively. The three and nine month expenses in 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 were higher for both periods due to the addition of consulting fees during the third period in 2016 and none in the same period in 2015 along with the expenses related to the costs for accounting, bank charges, auditing and filing of financial reports.     Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $14,154 and $21,832, compared to $3,250 and $7,750 for the same periods ended September 30, 2015.                  9       
     Table of Contents          Liquidity      The Company has negative working capital of $52,819 as of September 30, 2016. Funds used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $22,332 while funds provided from financing activities were $42,021 consisting of sale of common stock of $20,400 and advances by related party of $21,621. This compares to funds used in operating activities of $6,000 and funds from financing activities of $6,000 for the period ended September 30, 2015.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.       Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         Item 4: Controls and Procedures.       Under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2016 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. Such conclusion reflects the identification of material weakness as follows: (1) lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function, and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review. Until we are able to remedy these material weaknesses, we have engaged third party consultants and accounting firm to assist with financial reporting.       Changes in internal controls      Our management, with the participation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to determine whether any change in our internal controls over financial reporting occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no changes occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1:   Legal Proceedings       There are not presently any material pending legal proceedings to which the Registrant is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Registrant to be threatened or contemplated against it.       Item 1A: Risk Factors       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 6,800 shares of common stock to 40 individuals at $3.00 per share for aggregate proceeds of $20,400.       Item 3: Defaults Upon Senior Securities       None       Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures       Not applicable       Item 5: Other Information       None              Item 6: Exhibits.                    SIGNATURES      In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Registrant caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
