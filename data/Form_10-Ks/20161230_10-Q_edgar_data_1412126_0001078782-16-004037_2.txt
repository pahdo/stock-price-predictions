REMSleep Holdings, Inc. f/k/a KAT GOLD HOLDINGS CORP.   
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 For the Period Ended June 30, 2015 
   
 NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Business Activity   
   
 REMSleep Holdings, Inc., f/k/a/ Kat Gold Holdings Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following its acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada ( Handcamp ), the Company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, the Company s name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings corp. As of this annual report, the Company has not generated any revenues but has incurred expenses related to the drilling and exploration of Handcamp. On January 5, 2015 the name of the Company was changed to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the Company; to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea. 
   
 The Company has not yet earned any revenue from operations.  
   
  Accounting Basis   
   
 The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP  accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. 
   
  Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
 For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
 The Company reports comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Long-Lived Assets   
   
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair market value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during the period ended March 31, 2015. 
   
  Risk and Uncertainties   
   
 The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the mining industry, including, but not limited to, litigation, development of new technological mining innovations and dependence on key personnel. 
   
 As of January 5, 2015, the Company is subject to risks common to manufacturing and health product providers. 
   
  Advertising Costs   
   
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company does not incur any direct-response advertising costs. 

7 

Stock-Based Compensation  
   
 The company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about stock based compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. 
   
  Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  
   
 The company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. 
   
 The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: 
   
 Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets and liabilities as of the reporting date. 
   
 Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 
   
 Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by the market data. 
   
 The carrying amounts of the company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, rent deposit, accounts payable, customer deposits and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  
   
 There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the period ended June 30, 2015. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Statements   
   
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and security deposits. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. 
   
  Loss Per Share   
   
 Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basic of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. It is the company's policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense. As of June 30, 2015 there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

  Overview   
   
 REMSleep Holdings, Inc., f/k/a/ Kat Gold Holdings Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following its acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada ( Handcamp ), the Company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, the Company s name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp.  
   
 On January 5, 2015 the name of the Company was changed to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the Company; to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea. 
   
 REMSleep Holdings, Inc. has a patent pending new, innovative sleep apnea product that will meet multiple market needs and be able to reach a large percentage of patients worldwide. REMSleep was founded by two principals with over 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including working at some of the pioneering companies. They have substantial direct knowledge of all current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) equipment on the market and what it is lacking. This expertise led to the invention of the DeltaWave CPAP interface.  

11 

The goal of RemSleep is to achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients. Years of research and development have led to the revolutionary DeltaWave CPAP interface, a design that addresses the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient s ability to comply with treatment. The DeltaWave interface does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics, is not claustrophobic, causes zero work of breathing (WOB), minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses, uses less driving pressure, and allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.  
   
 RemSleep is confident that DeltaWave s unique design will provide patients with a more compliant CPAP interface that provides improved comfort, ease of use, and encourages deep restful sleep. The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea. 
   
 The DeltaWave will be launched into the U.S. market first, while CE marking is obtained. REMSleep has already begun discussions with potential industry distributor partners in the U.S., and has received strong interest from a potential distribution partner in Germany that has sales channels/distribution partners throughout the EU. They have no current product like the REMSleep DeltaWave and are awaiting samples for evaluation. REMSleep has also been in contact with two internet retailers. One sells directly to patients online (the largest internet reseller of sleep products), and the other is working with trucking firms (selling direct to drivers).  
   
 REMSleep s founders have extensive experience in the sleep industry, and have direct experience in starting companies and introducing unique products. COB Russell Bird, for example, found great success with start-ups Medical Gases Australia and Medical Industries America (both started out of garages before being multimillion-dollar ventures). Tom Wood helped found Innomed Technologies, and has product-development experience developing highly successful products in the industry. The two founders have worked in collaboration for more than 10 years and are now focused on bringing to market the best-in-class DeltaWave CPAP interface, with the goal of becoming a leading product manufacturer and distributor in this fast-growing global market. The owners have invested $100,000 in R D for the DeltaWave, and are seeking an investment of $1 million for the full launch.  
   
 Research and Development 
   
 We are currently engaged in the research and development of new products with the intent of launching them in the future. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop new products or bring any new products to market.

  Results of Operations  
   
 The company has had no revenue for the three or six months ended June 30, 2015 or June 30, 2014.  Total expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $38,613and $0 for the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Total expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $72,776 and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. 
   
  Cash Requirements   
   
 We operate with virtually no capital. We have no long term debt and have been able to meet our past financial obligations, including operational expenses, exploration expenses and acquisition costs, on a current basis.  
   
  Going Concern   
   
 As of June 30, 2015, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business.  
   
 We have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception. In addition, we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business. As a result of these and other factors, our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.  
   
 Management s plans with regard to these matters encompass the following actions: (i) obtaining funding from new investors to alleviate our working capital deficiency, and (ii) implementing a plan to generate sales. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems and increase profitability in our current business operations. However, the outcome of management s plans cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
 We had a cash balance of $0 as of the date of June 30, 2015.  
   
   Cash flow from operations .   
   
 Cash flow from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were ($72,318) compared to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. 
   
 Cash flows from investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were ($10,331) compared to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. 
   
 Cash flows from financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $73,969 compared to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (  GAAP  ), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  
   
  Business Activities.  We have not yet earned any revenue from operations. Accordingly, our activities have been accounted for as those of a  Development Stage Enterprise  as set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 7,  Accounting and Reporting for Development Stage Enterprises  (  SFAS No. 7  ). Among the disclosures required by SFAS No. 7 are that our financial statements be identified as those of a development stage operation, and that the statements of operations, shareholders  equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of our inception.  
   
  Basis of Presentation.  Our financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP, whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred. We follow SFAS No. 7 in preparing our financial statements.  
   
  Management s Use of Estimates . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
   
  Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,  Reporting Comprehensive Income,  which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to us during the period covered in the financial statements.  
   
  Long-Lived Assets.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, including those noted above, we compare the assets  carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives. If the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows. Any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period.  

13 

Statement of Cash Flows . For purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments (i.e., investments which, when purchased, have original maturities of three months or less) to be cash equivalents.  
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the recorded amounts because of the liquidity and short-term nature of these items.  
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that any future adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations.  
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  The three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015  
   
 For the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively; and net losses were $38,613 and $0 respectively. The net losses were attributable to operating expenses and primarily to impairment charges.  
   
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  
   
 Not Applicable 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 Each of our principal executive and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that applied as of December 31, 2011 and continued to apply as of June 30, 2015. Our management intends, during the 2015 fiscal year, to design and implement processes and procedures that will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .  
   
 Our management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the relevant period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
