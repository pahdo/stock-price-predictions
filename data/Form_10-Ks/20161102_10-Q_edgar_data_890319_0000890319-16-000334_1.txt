  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 - Interim Financial Statements 
    
  General 
    
  Taubman Centers, Inc. (the Company or TCO) is a Michigan corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG) is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of TCO that owns direct or indirect interests in all of the Company s real estate properties. In this report, the term  Company" refers to TCO, the Operating Partnership, and/or the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries as the context may require. The Company engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, disposition, development, and expansion of regional and super-regional retail shopping centers and interests therein. The Company s owned portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   included   23   urban and suburban shopping centers operating in   11   U.S. states, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and China. 
    
  Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia), which is the platform for the Company s operations and developments in China and South Korea, is headquartered in Hong Kong.  
    
  The unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods have been made. The results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. 
    
  Dollar amounts presented in tables within the notes to the financial statements are stated in thousands, except share data or as otherwise noted.  
    
  Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company include all accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including The Taubman Company LLC (the Manager) and Taubman Asia. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The entities included in these consolidated financial statements are separate legal entities and maintain records and books of account separate from any other entity. However, inclusion of these separate entities in the consolidated financial statements does not mean that the assets and credit of each of these legal entities are available to satisfy the debts or other obligations of any other such legal entity included in the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Investments in entities not controlled but over which the Company may exercise significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures or UJVs) are accounted for under the equity method. The Company has evaluated its investments in the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and has concluded that the ventures are not variable interest entities. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its interests in these entities under general accounting standards for investments in real estate ventures (including guidance for determining effective control of a limited partnership or similar entity). The Company s partners or other owners in these Unconsolidated Joint Ventures have substantive participating rights including approval rights over annual operating budgets, capital spending, financing, admission of new partners/members, or sale of the properties and the Company has concluded that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for these interests. Specifically, the Company s   79%   and   50.1%   investments in Westfarms and International Plaza, respectively, are through general partnerships in which the other general partners have participating rights over annual operating budgets, capital spending, refinancing, or sale of the property. The Company provides its beneficial interest in certain financial information of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (Notes 4 and 5). This beneficial information is derived as the Company's ownership interest in the investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being presented. Investors are cautioned that deriving the Company's beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding a noncontrolling interest in the investee. 
    
  In 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  This standard amends certain guidance applicable to the consolidation of various legal entities, including variable interest entities (VIE). The Company evaluated the application of the ASU and concluded that no change was required to its accounting or reporting for any of its interests in less than wholly owned joint ventures. However, under the new guidance all of the Company s consolidated joint ventures, including the Operating Partnership, now meet the definition and criteria as VIEs. The Company or an affiliate of the Company is the primary beneficiary of each VIE.

  TAUBMAN CENTERS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In determining the method of accounting for partially owned joint ventures, the Company evaluates the characteristics of associated entities and determines whether an entity is a VIE, and, if so, determines whether the Company is the primary beneficiary by analyzing whether the Company has both the power to direct the entity's significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits. Significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this analysis include the nature of the entity's operations, the entity's financing and capital structure, and contractual relationship and terms, including consideration of governance and decision making rights. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary. 
    
  The Company s sole significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership and, consequently, substantially all of the Company s consolidated assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. All of the Company s debt (Note 5) is an obligation of the Operating Partnership or its consolidated subsidiaries. Note 5 also provides disclosure of guarantees provided by the Operating Partnership to certain consolidated joint ventures. Note 7 provides additional disclosures of the carrying balance of the noncontrolling interests in its consolidated joint ventures and other information, including a description of certain rights of the noncontrolling owners. 
    
  Ownership 
    
  In addition to the Company s common stock, there were   three   classes of preferred stock outstanding (Series B, J, and K) as of   September 30, 2016  . Dividends on the   6.5%   Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series J Preferred Stock) and the   6.25%   Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series K Preferred Stock) are cumulative and are paid on the last day of each calendar quarter. The Company owns corresponding Series J and Series K Preferred Equity interests in the Operating Partnership that entitle the Company to income and distributions (in the form of guaranteed payments) in amounts equal to the dividends payable on the Company s Series J and Series K Preferred Stock. 
    
  The Company also is obligated to issue to partners in the Operating Partnership other than the Company, upon subscription,   one share of nonparticipating Series B Preferred Stock per each Operating Partnership unit  . The Series B Preferred Stock entitles its holders to   one vote per share   on all matters submitted to the Company s shareowners and votes together with the common stock on all matters as a single class. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to dividends or earnings. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into the Company s common stock at a   ratio of 14,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock  . 
    
  Outstanding voting securities of the Company at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   25,029,059   shares of Series B Preferred Stock and   60,405,097   shares of common stock. 
    
  The Operating Partnership 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership s equity included   two   classes of preferred equity (Series J and K) and the net equity of the partnership unitholders. Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable first to the preferred equity interests, and the remaining amounts to the general and limited partners in the Operating Partnership in accordance with their percentage ownership. The Series J and Series K Preferred Equity are owned by the Company and are eliminated in consolidation.  
    
  The Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership at   September 30, 2016   consisted of a   71%   managing general partnership interest, as well as the Series J and Series K Preferred Equity interests. The Company's average ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership for both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   71%  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership had   85,451,376   partnership units outstanding, of which the Company owned   60,405,097   units. Disclosures about partnership units outstanding exclude Profits Units granted or other share-based grants for which partnership units may eventually be issued (Note 9).

Change in Accounting Policy - Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" which changed the presentation of debt issuance costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, the Company retrospectively reclassified the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet to move   $16.9 million   of debt issuance costs out of Deferred Charges and Other Assets and into Notes Payable, Net as a direct deduction of the related debt liabilities. Prior to the reclassification, the Company reported   $198.2 million   and   $2.644 billion   within Deferred Charges and Other Assets and Notes Payable, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU No. 2015-15, the Company retained its current methodology for recording and presenting debt issuance costs incurred in connection with its revolving lines of credit and will continue to recognize those costs as Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Management s Responsibility to Evaluate the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
    
  In connection with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern" on January 1, 2016,   when preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management now has the responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. No such conditions or events were identified as of the issuance date of the financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  .  

Note 2 - Acquisition, Redevelopments, Developments, and Service Agreement 
    
  Acquisition 
    
  Country Club Plaza 
    
  In March 2016, a joint venture that the Company formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for   $660 million   (  $330 million   at TRG's share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. The Company has a   50%   ownership interest in the center, which is jointly managed by both companies. The Company's ownership interest in the center is accounted for as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture under the equity method. The joint venture determined the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon acquisition. Also, in March 2016, a   10  -year,   $320 million   (  $160 million   at TRG's share) non-recourse financing was completed for this center.

The shopping center opened in April 2016. Also in April 2016, the joint venture effectively acquired the   40%   noncontrolling interest in the project for approximately   $150 million  , increasing the partnership s interest to   100%  . The Company s share of the purchase price for the additional interest was approximately   $75 million  . As a result of the acquisition, the Company s effective ownership in the center is   50%  , an increase from the Company s previous   30%   effective interest. This investment is classified within Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  CityOn.Zhengzhou 
    
  The Company also has a second joint venture with Wangfujing which owns a majority interest in and will manage an approximately   1.0 million   square foot multi-level shopping center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, under construction in Zhengzhou, China.

As a result of the acquisition, the Company s effective ownership in the center is   49%  , an increase from the Company's previous   32%   effective interest. The Company expects the additional investment to be approximately   $60 million  , including the purchase price of the   17%   interest as well as future funding of construction at the increased ownership percentage. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's share of total project costs was   $157.5 million  , which was decreased by   $4.2 million   for the change in exchange rates. This investment is classified within Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Starfield Hanam 
    
  The Company's joint venture with Shinsegae Group, one of South Korea's largest retailers, owns and manages an approximately   1.7 million   square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, located in Hanam, South Korea. The shopping center opened in September 2016. The Company has partnered with a major institution in Asia for a   49%   ownership interest in Starfield Hanam. The institutional partner owns   14.7%   of the center, bringing the Company's effective ownership to   34.3%  . This investment is classified within Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Restricted Deposits 
    
  During 2016, the Company provided   $108.2 million   of restricted deposits related to its Asia joint ventures and other investments. These deposits are classified within Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Service Agreement

Note 3 - Income Taxes 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  The Company s income tax expense (benefit) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   consisted of the following: 

(1) 
    Amount represents an adjustment of the income taxes incurred as part of the Company's sale of interests in International Plaza in January 2014. The adjustment is classified within Gain on Dispositions, Net of Tax on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
       
  Deferred Taxes 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to recognize the net deferred tax assets. These future operations are primarily dependent upon the Manager s profitability, the timing and amounts of gains on peripheral land sales, the profitability of Taubman Asia's operations, and other factors affecting the results of operations of the taxable REIT subsidiaries. The valuation allowances relate to net operating loss carryforwards and tax basis differences where there is uncertainty regarding their realizability.

Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
    
  General Information 
    
  The Company owns beneficial interests in joint ventures that own shopping centers. The Operating Partnership is the sole direct or indirect managing general partner or managing member of Fair Oaks, International Plaza, Stamford Town Center, Sunvalley, The Mall at University Town Center, and Westfarms. The Operating Partnership also provides certain management, leasing, and/or development services to the other shopping centers noted below. 

(1) 
    In April 2016, the joint venture effectively acquired the   40%   noncontrolling interest in the project. As a result of the acquisition, the Company s effective ownership is   50%  , an increase from the Company s previous   30%   effective interest (Note 2). 
        
  The Company's carrying value of its Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures differs from its share of the partnership or members  equity reported on the combined balance sheet of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures due to (i) the Company's cost of its investment in excess of the historical net book values of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and (ii) the Operating Partnership s adjustments to the book basis, including intercompany profits on sales of services that are capitalized by the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The Company's additional basis allocated to depreciable assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over   40 years  . The Operating Partnership s differences in bases are amortized over the useful lives or terms of the related assets and liabilities. 
    
  In its Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company separately reports its investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and net income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The net equity of certain joint ventures is   less than zero   because distributions are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. In addition, any distributions related to refinancing of the centers further decrease the net equity of the centers.

Combined Financial Information 
    
  Combined balance sheet and results of operations information is presented in the following table for the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, followed by the Operating Partnership's beneficial interest in the combined operations information. The combined information of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   excludes the balances of Starfield Hanam, which opened in September 2016, as well as CityOn.Zhengzhou, which is under construction (Note 2). In addition, the combined information of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures as of   December 31, 2015   excluded the balances of CityOn.Xi'an, which was under construction as of   December 31, 2015   (Note 2). Beneficial interest is calculated based on the Operating Partnership's ownership interest in each of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

Note 5 - Beneficial Interest in Debt and Interest Expense 
    
  The Operating Partnership's beneficial interest in the debt, capitalized interest, and interest expense of its consolidated subsidiaries and its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures is summarized in the following table. The Operating Partnership's beneficial interest in the consolidated subsidiaries excludes debt and interest related to the noncontrolling interest in Cherry Creek Shopping Center (  50%  ), International Market Place (  6.5%  ), and The Mall of San Juan (  5%  ). 

(1) 
    The December 31, 2015 balances have been adjusted in connection with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 "Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (Note 1). 
              (2) 
    The Company capitalizes interest costs incurred in funding its equity contributions to development projects accounted for as Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The capitalized interest cost is included in the Company's basis in its investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

Note 6 - Equity Transactions 
    
  In August 2013, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to   $200 million   of its outstanding common stock. In March 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased the authorization by   $250 million  , bringing the total authorization to   $450 million  . The Company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions. No shares have been repurchased in 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company cumulatively repurchased   4,247,867   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $71.79   per share, for a total of   $304.9 million   under the authorization.

Note 7 - Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Taubman Asia President 
    
  The Company's president of Taubman Asia (the Asia President) has an ownership interest in Taubman Asia, a consolidated subsidiary. As of   September 30, 2016  , this interest entitled the Asia President to   5%   of Taubman Asia's dividends, with   85%   of his dividends being withheld as contributions to capital. These withholdings will continue until he contributes and maintains his capital consistent with his percentage ownership interest, including all capital funded by the Operating Partnership for Taubman Asia's operating and investment activities subsequent to the Asia President obtaining his ownership interest. The Operating Partnership has a preferred investment in Taubman Asia to the extent the Asia President has not yet contributed capital commensurate with his ownership interest. This preferred investment accrues an annual preferential return equal to the Operating Partnership's average borrowing rate (with the preferred investment and accrued return together being referred to herein as the preferred interest). In addition, Taubman Asia has the ability to call, and the Asia President has the ability to put, the Asia President s ownership interest upon specified terminations of the Asia President s employment, although such put or call right may not be exercised for specified time periods after certain termination events. The redemption price for the ownership interest is   50%   (increasing to   100%   as early as June 2017) of the fair value of the ownership interest less the amount required to return the Operating Partnership's preferred interest. The Company has determined that the Asia President's ownership interest in Taubman Asia qualifies as an equity award, considering its specific redemption provisions, and accounts for it as a contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest. The Company presents as temporary equity at each balance sheet date an estimate of the redemption value of the ownership interest, therefore falling into level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, taking into account the proportion of the Asia President's services rendered before he is fully vested. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of this redeemable equity was   $8.4 million  . Any adjustments to the redemption value are recorded through equity.  
    
  In April 2016, the Company reacquired half of the Asia President s ownership interest in Taubman Asia for   $7.2 million  . The Asia President contributed   $2 million   to Taubman Asia, which may be returned, in part or in whole, upon satisfaction of the re-evaluation of the full liquidation value of Taubman Asia as of April 2016; such re-evaluation will be performed at the Asia President's election on or after the third anniversary of the opening of specified Asia projects. The Asia President s remaining   5%   interest is puttable beginning in 2019 at the earliest, upon reaching certain specified milestones, and was classified as Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The   $7.2 million   acquisition price is reflected as a distribution to noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
    
  International Market Place 
    
  The Company owns a   93.5%   controlling interest in a joint venture that owns International Market Place in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, which opened in August 2016. The   6.5%   joint venture partner has no obligation nor the right to contribute capital. The Company is entitled to a preferential return on its capital contributions. The Company has the right to purchase the joint venture partner's interest and the joint venture partner has the right to require the Company to purchase the joint venture partner's interest after the third anniversary of the opening of the center, and annually thereafter. The purchase price of the joint venture partner's interest will be based on fair value. Considering the redemption provisions, the Company accounts for the joint venture partner's interest as a contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of   zero   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Any adjustments to the redemption value are recorded through equity.

(1)   In 2016 and 2015, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were made as a result of changes in the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership in connection with the Company's share-based compensation under employee and director benefit plans (Note 9) and issuances of stock pursuant to the Continuing Offer (Note 10). In 2016, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were also made in connection with the accounting for the Asia President's redeemable ownership interest. In 2015, adjustments of the noncontrolling interest were also made as a result of share repurchases (Note 6). 
    
  Finite Life Entities 
    
  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity  establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held a controlling interest in a consolidated entity with a specified termination date in   2083  . The noncontrolling owners' interest in this entity is to be settled upon termination by distribution or transfer of either cash or specific assets of the underlying entity. The estimated fair value of this noncontrolling interest was approximately   $360 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a book value of   $(157.4) million   that is classified in Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was calculated as the noncontrolling interest's ownership shares of the underlying property's fair value. The property's fair value was estimated by considering its in-place net operating income, current market capitalization rate, and mortgage debt outstanding.

Note 8 - Derivative and Hedging Activities 
    
  Risk Management Objective and Strategies for Using Derivatives 
    
  The Company uses derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings. The Company may also enter into forward starting swaps or treasury lock agreements to set the effective interest rate on a planned fixed-rate financing. The Company s interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. In a forward starting swap or treasury lock agreement that the Company cash settles in anticipation of a fixed rate financing or refinancing, the Company will receive or pay an amount equal to the present value of future cash flow payments based on the difference between the contract rate and market rate on the settlement date. 
    
  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding derivatives that were designated and are expected to be effective as cash flow hedges of the interest payments and/or the currency exchange rate on the associated debt. 

(1) 
    The hedged forecasted transaction for each of these swaps is the first previously unhedged   one-month LIBOR  -indexed interest payments accrued and made each month on a debt principal amount equal to the swap notional amount, regardless of the specific debt agreement from which they may flow. The Company is currently using these swaps to manage interest rate risk on the   $475 million   unsecured term loan. The credit spread on this loan can also vary within a range of   1.35%   to   1.90%  , depending on the Company's leverage ratio at the measurement date. 
              (2) 
    The notional amount on this swap is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the floating rate loan on the U.S. headquarters building. 
              (3) 
    The notional amount on each of these swaps is equal to   50%   of the outstanding principal balance of the loan on Fair Oaks. 
              (4) 
    The notional amount on this swap is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the floating rate loan on International Plaza. 
              (5) 
    The notional amount on this swap is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the U.S. dollar construction loan for Starfield Hanam. There is a cross-currency interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the loan and swap the related principal and interest payments from U.S. dollars to KRW in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the cash flows of the joint venture. The currency swap exchange rate is   1,162.0  .

Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). The ineffective portion of the change in fair value, if any, is recognized directly in earnings. Net realized gains or losses resulting from derivatives that were settled in conjunction with planned fixed-rate financings or refinancings continue to be included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) during the term of the hedged debt transaction. 
    
  Amounts reported in AOCI related to currently outstanding interest rate derivatives are recognized as an adjustment to income as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. Realized gains or losses on settled derivative instruments included in AOCI are recognized as an adjustment to income over the term of the hedged debt transaction. Amounts reported in AOCI related to the cross-currency interest rate swap are recognized as an adjustment to income as transaction gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated loans are recognized and as actual interest and principal obligations are repaid. 
    
  The Company expects that approximately   $8.1 million   of the AOCI of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the noncontrolling interests will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized as a reduction of income in the following 12 months. 
    
  The following tables present the effect of derivative instruments on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . The tables include the amount of gains or losses on outstanding derivative instruments recognized in OCI in cash flow hedging relationships and the location and amount of gains or losses reclassified from AOCI into income resulting from outstanding derivative instruments. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   $0.5 million   of hedge ineffectiveness income and   $0.3 million   of hedge ineffectiveness expense, respectively, related to the swaps used to hedge the unsecured term loan. The hedge ineffectiveness for both periods was recorded in Nonoperating Income, Net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a loss of   $0.2 million   in Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income related to the Starfield Hanam swap prior to its hedge inception in September 2015.

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   $0.2 million   of hedge ineffectiveness income and   $0.5 million   of hedge ineffectiveness expense, respectively, related to the swaps used to hedge the unsecured term loan. The hedge ineffectiveness for both periods was recorded in Nonoperating Income, Net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a loss of   $0.2 million   in Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income related to the Starfield Hanam swap prior to its hedge inception in September 2015.  

The Company records all derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents the location and fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

Contingent Features 
    
  All of the Company's outstanding derivatives contain provisions that state if the hedged entity defaults on its indebtedness above a certain threshold, then the derivative obligation could also be declared in default. The cross default thresholds vary for each agreement, ranging from   $0.1 million   of any indebtedness to   $50 million   of recourse indebtedness on the Company or the Operating Partnership's indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is not in default on any indebtedness that would trigger a credit-risk-related default on its current outstanding derivatives.   
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was   $18.5 million   and   $11.1 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was not required to post any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company breached any of these provisions it would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their fair value.

Note 9 - Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Taubman Company LLC 2008 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (2008 Omnibus Plan), as amended, which is shareowner approved, provides for the award to directors, officers, employees, and other service providers of the Company of restricted shares, restricted units of limited partnership in the Operating Partnership, options to purchase shares or Operating Partnership units, unrestricted shares, Profits Units, or Operating Partnership units, and other awards to acquire up to an aggregate of   8.5 million   Company common shares or Operating Partnership units. In addition, non-employee directors have the option to defer their compensation under a deferred compensation plan. 
    
  Non-option awards granted after an amendment of the 2008 Omnibus Plan in 2010 are deducted at a ratio of   1.85   Company common shares or Operating Partnership units, while non-option awards granted prior to the amendment are deducted at a ratio of   2.85  . Options are deducted on a   one-for-one   basis. The amount available for future grants is adjusted when the number of contingently issuable shares or units are settled, for grants that are forfeited, and for options that expire without being exercised. 
    
  Prior to the adoption of the 2008 Omnibus Plan, the Company provided share-based compensation through an incentive option plan and non-employee directors' stock grant and deferred compensation plans. 
    
  The compensation cost charged to income for the Company s share-based compensation plans was   $3.2 million   and   $9.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The compensation cost charged to income for the Company s share-based compensation plans was   $1.3 million   and   $8.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , a reversal of   $2.7 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, of prior period share-based compensation expense was recognized upon the announcement of an executive management transition as a reduction of General and Administrative expense on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Compensation cost capitalized as part of properties and deferred leasing costs was   $0.6 million   and   $1.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.2 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company has estimated the grant-date fair values of share-based grants using the methods discussed in the separate sections below for each type of grant. Expected volatility and dividend yields are based on historical volatility and yields of the Company s common stock, respectively, as well as other factors. The risk-free interest rates used are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curves in effect at the times of grants. The Company assumes no forfeitures for failure to meet the service requirements of options, Performance Share Units (PSU), or Profits Units, due to the small number of participants and low turnover rate. 
    
  Options 
    
  A summary of option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

No options were granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all options outstanding were fully vested, and there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to options. 
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the period end stock price and the option exercise price) of in-the-money options outstanding was   $5.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  
  TAUBMAN CENTERS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2.4 million   and   $10.0 million  , respectively. Cash received from option exercises for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.8 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  Under both the prior option plan and the 2008 Omnibus Plan, vested unit options can be exercised by tendering mature units with a market value equal to the exercise price of the unit options. In 2002, Robert S. Taubman, the Company s chief executive officer, exercised options for   3.0 million   units by tendering   2.1 million   mature units and deferring receipt of   0.9 million   units under the unit option deferral election. As the Operating Partnership pays distributions, the deferred option units receive their proportionate share of the distributions in the form of cash payments. Under an amendment executed in January 2011 and subsequent deferral elections (the latest being made in September 2016), beginning in   December 2022   (unless Mr. Taubman retires earlier), the deferred partnership units will be issued in   five   annual installments. The deferred units are accounted for as participating securities of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  Profits Units 
    
  In June 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) of the Company approved an amendment to the long-term incentive program for senior management (as amended, the Revised LTIP program) of the Manager. Under the Revised LTIP program, senior management have the option to receive  Profits Units , intended to constitute "profits interests" within the meaning of Treasury authority under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which are a class of limited partnership interests in TRG, pursuant to: (1) time-based awards with a three-year cliff vesting period (Restricted TRG Profits Units); (2) performance-based awards that are based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return (TSR) thresholds over a three-year period (relative TSR Performance-based TRG Profits Units); and (3) performance-based awards that are based on the achievement of net operating income (NOI) thresholds over a three-year period (NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units). The maximum number of performance-based Profits Units was issued at grant and will be clawed back (and to the extent clawed back, forfeited) once the TSR and NOI performance measures are finally determined. 
    
  In June 2016, Profits Units were granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan. Each Profits Unit   represents a contingent right to receive a partnership unit upon vesting and the satisfaction of certain tax-driven requirements. Until vested, a Profits Unit entitles the holder to only one-tenth of the distributions payable on a partnership unit. Therefore, the Company accounts for these Profits Units as participating securities in the Operating Partnership. A portion of the Profits Units award represents estimated cash distributions that otherwise would have been payable during the vesting period and, upon vesting, there will be an adjustment in Profits Units to reflect actual cash distributions during such period  . Under the Company's Continuing Offer,   each partnership unit held by a participant is exchangeable for one share of the Company's common stock  . Upon conversion of the Profits Units to partnership units, the holder will have the right to purchase   one share of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company for each partnership unit held  . 
    
  Each holder of a Profits Unit will be treated as a limited partner in TRG from the date of grant. To the extent the vested Profits Units have not achieved the tax criteria for conversion to partnership units, vesting and economic equivalence to a partnership unit prior to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, the awards will be forfeited pursuant to the terms of the award agreement. The accounting valuations of Profits Units consider the possibility that sufficient share price appreciation will not be realized, such that the conversion to partnership units will not occur and the awards will be forfeited. 
    
  Restricted TRG Profits Units 
    
  In June 2016, Restricted TRG Profits Units were granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan. The units vest in March 2019, if continuous service has been provided, or upon retirement or certain other events (such as death or disability) if earlier. The Company estimated the value of these Restricted TRG Profits Units granted using the Company s common stock price at the grant date as adjusted by the present value of expected differences in dividends payable on the common stock versus the distributions payable on the Restricted TRG Profits Units over the vesting period, a weighted average risk-free rate of   1.85%  , and a weighted average measurement period of   2.6   years.

A summary of Restricted TRG Profits Units activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

None of the Restricted TRG Profits Units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were vested. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $3.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested Restricted TRG Profits Units outstanding. This cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of   2.3   years. 
    
  Relative TSR Performance-based TRG Profits Units 
    
  In June 2016, Relative TSR Performance-based TRG Profits Units were granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan. The units vest in March 2019, if continuous service has been provided, or upon retirement or certain other events (such as death or disability) if earlier. The maximum number of Relative TSR Performance-based Profits Units was issued at grant and will be clawed back (and to the extent clawed back, forfeited) once the TSR performance measures are finally determined. The Company estimated the value of these relative TSR Performance-based TRG Profits Units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation, considering the Company s common stock price at the grant date as adjusted by the present value of expected differences in dividends payable on the common stock versus the distributions payable on the Relative TSR Performance-based TRG Profits Units over the vesting period, historical returns of the Company and the peer group of companies, a risk-free interest rate of   1.03%   and a measurement period of approximately   three   years.

NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units 
    
  In June 2016, NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units were granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan. The units vest in March 2019, if continuous service has been provided, or upon retirement or certain other events (such as death or disability) if earlier. The maximum number of NOI Performance-based Profits Units was issued at grant and will be clawed back (and to the extent clawed back, forfeited) once the NOI performance measures are finally determined. These awards also provide for a cap on the maximum number of units if a specified TSR level is not achieved. The Company considers the NOI measure a performance condition, and as such, has estimated a grant-date fair value for each of its possible outcomes. The compensation cost ultimately will be recognized equal to the grant-date fair value of the award that coincides with the actual outcome of the NOI performance. The Company estimated these grant-date fair values of these NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units granted using a Monte Carlo simulation, considering the Company s common stock price at the grant date as adjusted by the present value of expected differences in dividends payable on the common stock versus the distributions payable on the NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units over the vesting period, a risk-free interest rate of   1.03%  , and a measurement period of approximately   three   years. 
    
  A summary of NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

(1) 
    The number of NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units shown as outstanding represents the number of awards granted and is equal to the maximum number of units that can be issued upon the final determination of the NOI performance. The weighted average grant-date fair value shown corresponds with management's current expectation of the probable outcome of the NOI performance measure, that   one-third   of the units will ultimately be issued. The product of the NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units outstanding and the grant-date fair value represents the compensation cost being recognized over the service period. 
       
  None of the NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were vested. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $2.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested NOI Performance-based TRG Profits Units outstanding. This cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of   2.4 years  .

  A summary of PSU activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

(1) 
    Based on the Company's market performance relative to that of a peer group, the actual number of shares of common stock issued upon vesting during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   zero  . That is, despite the completion of applicable employee service requirements, the number of shares ultimately considered earned is determined by the extent to which the TSR market performance measure was achieved during the performance period. 
       
  None of the PSU outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were vested. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $3.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSU outstanding. This cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of   1.0   years. 
    
  Restricted Share Units 
    
  In 2016, Restricted Share Units (RSU) were issued under the 2008 Omnibus Plan and   represent the right to receive upon vesting one share of the Company's common stock, plus a cash payment equal to the aggregate cash dividends that would have been paid on such shares of common stock from the date of grant of the award to the vesting date  . The units vest in March 2019, if continuous service has been provided, or upon retirement or certain other events (such as death or disability) if earlier. The Company estimated the values of these RSU using the Company s common stock price at the grant dates. 
    
  A summary of RSU activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

None of the RSU outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were vested. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $5.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSU outstanding. This cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of   1.7   years.

Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies  
    
  Cash Tender 
    
  At the time of the Company's initial public offering and acquisition of its partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in 1992, the Company entered into an agreement (as later amended and restated, the Cash Tender Agreement) with A. Alfred Taubman, as trustee of the A. Alfred Taubman Restated Revocable Trust (the Revocable Trust) and TRA Partners (now Taubman Ventures Group LLC or TVG), each of whom owned an interest in the Operating Partnership, whereby each of the Revocable Trust and TVG has the right to tender to the Company partnership units in the Operating Partnership (provided that the aggregate value is at least   $50 million  ) and cause the Company to purchase the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market valuation of the Company on the trading date immediately preceding the date of the tender except as provided below with respect to the Company s right to finance the purchase through the sale of new shares of its stock. TVG is controlled by a majority-in-interest among the Revocable Trust and entities affiliated with the children of A. Alfred Taubman (Robert S. Taubman, William S. Taubman, and Gayle Taubman Kalisman). At the election of the person making a tender, partnership units in the Operating Partnership held by members of A. Alfred Taubman s family and partnership units held by entities in which his family members hold interests may be included in such a tender. Upon the death of A. Alfred Taubman in April 2015, the successor trustees of the Revocable Trust (Robert S. Taubman, William S. Taubman and Gayle Taubman Kalisman) act on behalf of the Revocable Trust.  In September 2016, the Revocable Trust distributed all of its directly held partnership units in the Operating Partnership to Robert S. Taubman, William S. Taubman and Gayle Taubman Kalisman, who then, through a series of transfers, transferred those partnership units to TF Associates LLC (TF), an entity owned by trusts for the benefit of their children.  As a result of those transfers, TF succeeded to the Revocable Trust s rights under the Cash Tender Agreement. 
    
  The Company will have the option to pay for these interests from available cash, borrowed funds, or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's common stock. Generally, the Company expects to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of its stock. The tendering partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company. The Company accounts for the Cash Tender Agreement as a freestanding written put option. As the option put price is defined by the current market price of the Company's stock at the time of tender, the fair value of the written option defined by the Cash Tender Agreement is considered to be   zero  . 
    
  Based on a market value at   September 30, 2016   of   $74.41   per share for the Company's common stock, the aggregate value of interests in the Operating Partnership that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was   $1.8 billion  . The purchase of these interests at   September 30, 2016   would have resulted in the Company owning an additional   28%   interest in the Operating Partnership. 
    
  Continuing Offer 
    
  The Company has made a continuing, irrevocable offer to all present holders (other than a certain excluded holder, currently TVG), permitted assignees of all present holders, those future holders of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership as the Company may, in its sole discretion, agree to include in the continuing offer, all existing optionees under the previous option plan, and all existing and future optionees under the 2008 Omnibus Plan to exchange shares of common stock for partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (the Continuing Offer). Under the Continuing Offer agreement,   one unit of the Operating Partnership interest is exchangeable for one share of the Company's common stock  . Upon a tender of Operating Partnership units, the corresponding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, if any, will automatically be converted into the Company s common stock at a   ratio of 14,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock  . 
    
  Insurance 
    
  The Company carries liability insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain losses, including those relating to personal injury claims. We believe the Company's insurance policy terms and conditions and limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss and industry practice. However, there are certain types of losses, such as punitive damage awards, that may not be covered by insurance, and not all potential losses are insured against. 
    
  Other 
    
  See Note 5 for the Operating Partnership's guarantees of certain notes payable, including guarantees relating to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, Note 7 for contingent features relating to certain joint venture agreements, Note 8 for contingent features relating to derivative instruments, and Note 9 for obligations under existing share-based compensation plans.

Note 11 - Earnings Per Share  
    
  Basic earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average of common shares outstanding for the respective periods. Diluted earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock includes outstanding partnership units exchangeable for common shares under the Continuing Offer (Note 10), outstanding options for partnership units, PSU, Restricted and Performance-based TRG Profits Units, RSU, deferred shares under the Non-Employee Directors  Deferred Compensation Plan, and unissued partnership units under a unit option deferral election (Note 9). In computing the potentially dilutive effect of potential common stock, partnership units are assumed to be exchanged for common shares under the Continuing Offer, increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The potentially dilutive effects of partnership units outstanding and/or issuable under the unit option deferral elections are calculated using the if-converted method, while the effects of other potential common stock are calculated using the treasury method. Contingently issuable shares are included in diluted EPS based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.  

The calculation of diluted earnings per share in certain periods excluded certain potential common stock including outstanding partnership units and unissued partnership units under a unit option deferral election, both of which may be exchanged for common shares of the Company under the Continuing Offer. The table below presents the potential common stock excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive in the period presented.

Note 12 - Fair Value Disclosures  
    
  This note contains required fair value disclosures for assets and liabilities remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis and financial instruments carried at other than fair value, as well as assumptions employed in deriving these fair values. 
    
  Recurring Valuations 
    
  Derivative Instruments 
    
  The fair value of interest rate hedging instruments is the amount that the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The Company s valuations of its derivative instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative, and therefore fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuations reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including forward curves. The fair values of interest rate hedging instruments also incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both the Company s own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk. 
    
  Other 
    
  The Company's valuation of an insurance deposit utilizes unadjusted quoted prices determined by active markets for the specific securities the Company has invested in, and therefore falls into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, quantitative disclosure of the fair value for each major category of assets and liabilities is presented below: 

The insurance deposit shown above represents an escrow account maintained in connection with a property and casualty insurance arrangement for the Company s shopping centers, and is classified within Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Corresponding deferred revenue relating to amounts billed to tenants for this arrangement has been classified within Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
    
  Financial Instruments Carried at Other Than Fair Values 
    
  Simon Property Group Limited Partnership Units 
    
  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned   590,124   partnership units in Simon Property Group Limited Partnership. The fair value of the partnership units, which is derived from Simon Property Group's common stock price and therefore falls into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, was   $122.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $114.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The partnership units were classified as Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and had a book value of   $77.7 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Notes Payable 
    
  The fair value of notes payable is estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates and therefore falls into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. When selecting discount rates for purposes of estimating the fair value of notes payable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company primarily employed the credit spreads at which the debt was originally issued. The Company does not believe that the use of different interest rate assumptions would have resulted in a materially different fair value of notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . To further assist financial statement users, the Company has included with its fair value disclosures an analysis of interest rate sensitivity. 
    
  The estimated fair values of notes payable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(1) 
    The December 31, 2015 balance has been adjusted in connection with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 "Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (Note 1). 
       
  The fair values of the notes payable are dependent on the interest rates used in estimating the values. An overall   1%   increase in rates employed in making these estimates would have decreased the fair values of the debt shown above at   September 30, 2016   by   $155.8 million   or   4.8%  . 
    
  Cash Equivalents and Notes Receivable 
    
  The fair value of cash equivalents and notes receivable approximates their carrying value due to their short maturity. The fair value of cash equivalents is derived from quoted market prices and therefore falls into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of notes receivable is estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates and therefore falls into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Note 14 - Cash Flow Disclosures and Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities   
    
  Interest paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net of amounts capitalized of   $17.9 million   and   $24.6 million  , respectively, was   $56.4 million   and   $43.7 million  , respectively. Income taxes paid for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $2.8 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively. The following non-cash investing and financing activities occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

(1) 
    In April 2015, the Company acquired an additional   15%   interest in The Mall of San Juan. The additional interest was acquired at cost. In connection with the acquisition, the noncontrolling owner used   $9.3 million   of previously contributed capital to fund its obligation to reimburse the Company for certain shared infrastructure costs, which was classified as a reduction of the noncontrolling interest and an offsetting reduction of properties. 
       
   Other non-cash additions to properties primarily represent accrued construction and tenant allowance costs. 

Note 15 - New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which provides guidance for the presentation of certain cash receipts and payments, including the classification of distributions received from equity method investees. ASU No. 2016-15 provides companies with two alternatives of presentation; the nature of the distribution approach or the cumulative earnings approach. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the application of this ASU and its effect on the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases", which provides for significant changes to the current lease accounting standard. The primary objectives of this ASU is to address off-balance-sheet financing related to operating leases and to introduce a new lessee model that brings substantially all leases onto the balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the application of this ASU and its effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities", which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Amongst its changes, this ASU requires an entity to measure equity investments at fair value through net income, except for those that result in consolidation or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the application of this ASU and its effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.   2014-09  , "Revenue from Contracts with Customers". This standard provides a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and gains and losses arising from transfers of non-financial assets including sales of property, plant, and equipment, real estate, and intangible assets. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 for public entities. ASU No. 2015-14 permits public entities to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 early, but not before the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2014-09 may be applied either retrospectively or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the application of this ASU and its effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains various  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expected because of various risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. Other risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in particular those set forth under "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the notes thereto. 

General Background and Performance Measurement 
    
  Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is a Michigan corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG) is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of TCO that owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, the Operating Partnership, and/or the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries as the context may require. We own, manage, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, and expand regional and super-regional shopping centers and interests therein. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements, The Taubman Company LLC (Manager), and Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method. 
    
  References in this discussion to  beneficial interest  refer to our ownership or pro-rata share of the item being discussed. Investors are cautioned that deriving our beneficial interest as our ownership interest in individual financial statement items may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding a noncontrolling interest in an investee. 
    
  The comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the opening of Starfield Hanam in September 2016 (See "Results of Operations - Taubman Asia"), the opening of International Market Place in August 2016 (See "Results of Operations - U.S. Development"), the opening of CityOn.Xi'an in April 2016 (See "Results of Operations - Taubman Asia"), the acquisition of Country Club Plaza in March 2016 (See "Results of Operations - Acquisition - Country Club Plaza"), the opening of The Mall of San Juan in March 2015 (See "Results of Operations - U.S. Development"), and the redevelopment of Beverly Center beginning in 2016 (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Spending - Planned 2016 Capital Spending"). Additional "comparable center" statistics that exclude the centers noted above are provided to present the performance of comparable centers. Comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period presented, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity. Comparable center statistics for 2015 have been restated to include comparable centers to 2016. This affects the comparability of our operating results period over period. Additionally, The Mall at University Town Center has also been excluded from comparable trailing 12-month statistics reported for 2016 and 2015 as the center was not open for the entire 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Also, the seven centers sold to an affiliate of Starwood in October 2014 have been excluded from comparable trailing 12-month statistics reported for 2015 as the centers were not owned at September 30, 2016.

Current Operating Trends 
    
  Our comparable mall tenants reported a   0.4%   increase in mall tenant sales per square foot in the   third   quarter of   2016   from the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our comparable mall tenant sales per square foot decreased   1.1%   from the comparable period in   2015  . For the trailing 12-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , mall tenant sales per square foot were $  790  , a   1.5%   decrease from $  802   for the trailing 12-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately 90% of these revenues and mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent, percentage rent, and recoverable expenses, excluding utilities (together, total occupancy costs), that mall tenants can afford to pay. However, levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs, and may be impacted significantly, either positively or negatively, by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant. 
    
  We believe that the ability of mall tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as mall tenant sales per square foot increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of mall tenant sales at higher sales per square foot. 
    
  Mall tenant sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay. The effects of increases or declines in mall tenant sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent. 
    
  In negotiating lease renewals, we generally intend to maximize the minimum rents we achieve. As a result, a tenant will generally pay a higher amount of minimum rent and an initially lower amount of percentage rent upon renewal.  
    
  While mall tenant sales are critical over the long term, the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants, its staggered lease maturities, and high proportion of fixed rent. However, a sustained trend in sales does impact, either negatively or positively, our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates. 
    
  Mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum rents, percentage rents, and expense recoveries, excluding utilities) as a percentage of sales in our Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are as follows:

Mall tenant ending occupancy and leased space statistics as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

(1)  Occupancy and leased space statistics include temporary in-line tenants (TILs) and anchor spaces at value and outlet centers (Dolphin Mall, Great Lakes Crossing Outlets, and Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield). 
    
  The difference between leased space and occupancy is that leased space includes spaces where leases have been signed but the tenants are not yet open. The occupancy statistic represents those spaces upon which we are currently collecting rent from mall tenants. The spread between comparable center leased space and occupied space, at 1.7% this quarter, is consistent with our history of 1% to 3% in the   third   quarter. 
    
  As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. Average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the lease currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions. In periods of increasing sales, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic.

  The spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods, as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces, and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount, location, and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period.

Seasonality 
    
  The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. While minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors, most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter, and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Additionally, most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter. Gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

Results of Operations 
    
  In addition to the results and trends in our operations discussed in the preceding sections, the following sections discuss certain transactions that affected operations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , or are expected to affect operations in the future. 
    
  Acquisition - Country Club Plaza 
    
  In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. We have a 50% ownership interest in the center, which is jointly managed by both companies. Our ownership interest in the center is accounted for as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture under the equity method. Also in March 2016, our joint venture completed a 10-year, $320 million ($160 million at TRG s beneficial share) non-recourse financing on Country Club Plaza. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Acquisition" for more information on this financing. 
  U.S. Development 
    
  In August 2016, International Market Place opened in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Spending - New Developments" for more information. The 0.3 million square foot center is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue. 
    
  In March 2015, The Mall of San Juan opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The 0.6 million square foot center is anchored by the Caribbean's first Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. In April 2015, we acquired an additional 15% interest in The Mall of San Juan, bringing our ownership in the center to 95%. The additional interest was acquired at cost. 
    
  Taubman Asia 
    
  We have a joint venture with Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd (Wangfujing), one of China's largest department store chains, which owns an interest in a shopping center, CityOn.Xi'an, located at Xi'an Saigao City Plaza in Xi'an, China, which opened in April 2016. We also have a joint venture with Wangfujing to develop a shopping center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, in Zhengzhou, China, which is scheduled to open in March 2017. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Spending - New Developments" for more information on these developments. 
    
  Also, we have invested in a shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea for which we have formed a joint venture with Shinsegae Group (Shinsegae), that opened in September 2016. At opening, the center was over 98% occupied. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Spending - New Developments" for more information. 
    
  We are providing management and leasing services for the retail portion of Studio City, a cinematically-themed integrated entertainment, retail and gaming resort developed by Melco Crown Entertainment Limited in the Cotai region of Macau, China, which opened in the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, we provide management and leasing services for IFC Mall in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. We have no ownership interests in these centers. 
    
  The Shops at Crystals 
    
  In April 2016, our third party leasing agreement for The Shops at Crystals (Crystals) was terminated in connection with a change in ownership of the center. As a result, we recognized management, leasing, and development services revenue for the lump sum payment of $21.7 million we received in May 2016 in connection with the termination.

Debt and Equity Transactions 
    
  In October 2016, a 10-year, $280 million non-recourse refinancing was completed for The Mall at University Town Center, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The payments on the loan, which bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 3.45%, are interest only for six years, and then amortizes principal based on 30 years. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to pay off the $225 million balance of the existing LIBOR plus 1.70% floating rate construction facility, which was scheduled to mature in October 2016. The remaining net proceeds, net of accrued interest and financing costs, were distributed to the joint venture partners based on ownership percentages. Our nearly $30 million share of excess proceeds was used to pay down our revolving lines of credit. 
  In May 2016, a 12-year, $550 million non-recourse refinancing was completed for Cherry Creek Shopping Center, a consolidated joint venture. The loan is interest-only during the entire term at an all-in fixed rate of 3.87%. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay the existing $280 million, 5.24% fixed rate loan, which was scheduled to mature in June 2016, with the remaining net proceeds distributed to the joint venture partners based on the partnership agreement ownership percentages. Our approximately $135 million share of excess proceeds was used to pay down our revolving lines of credit. 
    
  In April 2016, a 10-year, $165 million non-recourse refinancing was completed for Waterside Shops, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The loan bears interest at an all-in-rate of 3.89% and is interest-only for the term of the loan. However, if net operating income available for debt service as defined in the loan agreement is less than a certain amount for calendar year 2020, the lender may require the loan to amortize based on a 30-year amortization period retroactive to May 2021. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay the existing $165 million, 5.54% stated fixed rate loan, which was scheduled to mature in October 2016. 
    
  In April 2016, we extended our $65 million secured secondary revolving line of credit for one year upon maturity. All significant terms of the credit facility remain unchanged as a result of the extension. 
    
  In April 2016, we repaid the $81.5 million, 6.10% stated fixed rate loan on The Gardens on El Paseo, which was scheduled to mature in June 2016. 
    
  In October 2015, we repaid the $15.6 million, 4.42% stated fixed rate loan on El Paseo Village, which was scheduled to mature in December 2015. 
    
  In September 2015, we completed a 12-year, $1 billion non-recourse refinancing for The Mall at Short Hills. The interest-only loan bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 3.56%. The proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay the existing $540 million, 5.47% fixed rate loan, which was scheduled to mature in December 2015, and to pay off our revolving lines of credit, with the remaining net proceeds held for general corporate purposes. 
    
  In August 2015, we completed a $330.9 million construction facility for International Market Place, a consolidated joint venture. Also, in July 2015, our joint venture closed on a construction facility for Starfield Hanam, an Unconsolidated Joint Venture. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Construction Financings" for further details regarding these financings. 
    
  In March 2015, a   $12 million   non-recourse refinancing was completed on our U.S. headquarters building. The loan is interest-only for the entire nine-year term, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.40%, and is prepayable at any time. The rate on the loan is fixed at 3.49% as a result of an interest rate swap. The proceeds from the new loan and available cash were used to pay off the existing $17.0 million, 5.90% fixed rate loan. 
    
  In August 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. In March 2015, our Board of Directors increased the authorization by   $250 million  , bringing the total authorization to   $450 million  . We may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions. No shares have been repurchased in 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we cumulatively repurchased 4,247,867 shares of our common stock at an average price of $71.79 per share, for a total of $304.9 million under the authorization. As of   September 30, 2016  , $145.1 million remained available under the repurchase program. All shares repurchased have been cancelled. For each share of our stock repurchased, one of our Operating Partnership units was redeemed. Repurchases of common stock were financed through general corporate funds, including borrowings under our existing revolving lines of credit.

Center Operations 
    
  See "Non-GAAP Measures - Use of Non-GAAP Measures" for the definition and discussion of Net Operating Income (NOI) and for the reconciliation of Net Income to NOI. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , comparable center NOI excluding lease cancellation income was up   4.5%   over the same period in 2015. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , comparable center NOI excluding lease cancellation income was up   5.5%   over the same period in 2015.  
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized our $2.1 million share of lease cancellation income.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense is impacted by the capitalization of interest on the costs of our U.S. and Asia development projects. We capitalize interest on our consolidated project costs and our equity contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures under development using our average consolidated borrowing rate, which does not reflect the specific source of funds for the costs and is generally greater than our incremental borrowing rate. Any excess of the capitalization rate over our incremental borrowing rate positively impacts our results of operations during the construction phase of our development projects. This positive impact will affect our results until the overall level of construction spending decreases. As these projects open, interest capitalization generally ends and we begin recognizing interest expense. In 2016, we have experienced an increase in interest expense as compared to 2015 primarily due to the opening of three ground-up development projects. Additionally, we continue to expect interest expense to increase in 2017 due to the previously mentioned openings in 2016, as well as the opening of an additional center in 2017. Beneficial interest in construction work in progress totaled $363.6 million as of   September 30, 2016  , which includes $339.6 million of assets on which interest is being capitalized.  
    
  Comparison of the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   to the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  The following is a comparison of our results for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as disclosed in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
    
  Total revenues for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were $  148.0 million  , an $  8.0 million   or   5.7%   increase from the comparable period in   2015  . Minimum rents and expense recoveries both increased partially due to the opening of International Market Place in August 2016. 
    
  In addition to the opening of International Market Place, the following impacted the growth in total revenues: 

the increase in minimum rents was further attributable to increases in average rent per square foot and occupancy; 

the increase in percentage rents was primarily attributable to certain post-closing adjustments relating to the portfolio of centers sold to Starwood in 2014; 

the increase in expense recoveries was also due to certain post-closing adjustments relating to the portfolio of centers sold to Starwood in 2014, as well as increases in occupancy at The Mall of San Juan, and increases in fixed common area maintenance revenues; and  

the decrease in revenue from management, leasing, and development services was primarily due to a decrease in fees for  Studio City, which opened in October 2015, as well as a decrease in fees from Crystals due to the termination of our third party leasing agreement in May 2016. 
       
  Total expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were $  133.3 million  , a $29.8 million or   28.8%   increase from the comparable period in   2015  . Maintenance, taxes, utilities, and promotion expense, other operating expense, interest expense, and depreciation expense all increased partially due to the opening of International Market Place in August 2016. 
    
  In addition to the opening of International Market Place, the following impacted the increase in total expenses: 

the increase in maintenance, taxes, utilities, and promotion expense was also due to increased expenses at The Mall of San Juan; 

the increase in other operating expense was further attributable to certain corporate level cost allocations no longer made to unconsolidated centers and an increase in Asia expenses; 

40 

     Table of Contents  

the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the completion of interest capitalization for The Mall of San Juan and on our equity in CityOn.Xi'an and Starfield Hanam, and the interest expense related to Country Club Plaza, partially offset by the interest savings from the pay off of our loans on The Gardens on El Paseo and El Paseo Village. Interest expense further increased due to reduced interest capitalization on our development projects; 

the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the reversal in 2015 of share-based compensation expense related to the announcement of a transition in executive management; and 

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was further attributable to changes in depreciable lives of tenant allowances in connection with early terminations, the completion of our redevelopment projects in 2015, and an increase in depreciation at The Mall of San Juan. 
       
  Nonoperating income, net increased due to a gain on sale of peripheral land in 2016 as well as an increase in interest income in 2016. 
    
  Income tax expense decreased primarily due to a tax benefit from certain start-up operations. 
    
  In 2016, the consolidated non-comparable centers contributed total operating revenues of $26.8 million, and incurred operating expenses, excluding interest expense and depreciation and amortization of $13.1 million. In 2015, the consolidated non-comparable centers contributed total operating revenues of $20.1 million, and incurred operating expenses, excluding interest expense and depreciation and amortization, of $10.2 million. 
    
  Net Income 
    
  Net income was $  35.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to $  52.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . After allocation of income to noncontrolling, preferred, and participating interests, the net income attributable to Taubman Centers, Inc. common shareowners for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was $  18.8 million   compared to $  30.4 million   in the comparable period in   2015  . Diluted earnings per common share was $  0.31   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to $  0.50   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Funds from Operations (FFO) and FFO per Common Share 
    
  Our FFO attributable to partnership unitholders and participating securities of TRG     was   $81.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $77.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . FFO per diluted common share was $0.94 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and $0.89 per common share for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Adjusted FFO attributable to partnership unitholders and participating securities of TRG for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was $81.4 million, compared to   $74.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , which excluded the reversal of certain executive share-based compensation expense. Adjusted FFO per diluted common share was $0.94 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and $0.86 per common share for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Total revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were $  446.4 million  , a $45.4 million or   11.3%   increase from the comparable period in   2015  . Minimum rents and expense recoveries both increased partially due to the opening of The Mall of San Juan in March 2015 and International Market Place in August 2016.  
    
  In addition to the openings of The Mall of San Juan and International Market Place, the following also impacted total revenues:

the increase in expense recoveries also was due to increases in fixed common area maintenance revenues and certain post-closing adjustments relating to the portfolio of centers sold to Starwood in 2014; and  

the increase in revenue from management, leasing, and development services was primarily due to revenue for the lump sum payment we received in May 2016 in connection with the termination of our third party leasing agreement for Crystals, partially offset by a decrease in fees for Studio City, which opened in October 2015. 
       
  Total expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were $  367.3 million  , a $  64.0 million   or   21.1%   increase from the comparable period in   2015  . Maintenance, taxes, utilities, and promotion expense, other operating expense, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization expense all increased partially due to the opening of The Mall of San Juan in March 2015 and International Market Place in August 2016. 
    
  In addition to the openings of The Mall of San Juan and International Market Place, the following also impacted total expenses: 

the increase in maintenance, taxes, utilities, and promotion expense was further attributable to increases in common area maintenance expenses; 

the increase in other operating expense was also due to increases in bad debt expense, a charge for a center-related legal matter, and an increase in Asia expenses, as well as certain corporate level cost allocations no longer made to unconsolidated centers; 

the decrease in expenses from management, leasing, and development services was primarily due to the decrease in expenses related to Studio City, which opened in October 2015;

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities, augmented by use of our existing revolving lines of credit, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets, pay dividends, and fund a portion of our major capital investments. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at or near maturity and, in certain cases, funding major capital investments. From time to time, we also may access the equity markets or sell interests in operating properties to raise additional funds or refinance existing obligations on a strategic basis, including using excess proceeds therefrom.  
    
  Property Encumbrances 
    
  We are primarily financed with property-specific secured debt and currently have six unencumbered center properties. The entities that own Beverly Center, Dolphin Mall, and Twelve Oaks Mall are guarantors under our unsecured primary revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan and are unencumbered assets under such facility and term loan. Under the related debt agreements, we are required to have a minimum of three eligible unencumbered assets with a minimum unencumbered asset value. Therefore, while any of the assets may be removed from the unencumbered asset pool and encumbered upon notice to lender, provided that there is no default and the required covenant calculations are met on a pro forma basis, a replacement eligible unencumbered asset would need to be added to the unencumbered asset pool. Besides the three centers previously noted, The Gardens on El Paseo, Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield, and Stamford Town Center, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture property, are unencumbered. 
    
  Cash and Revolving Lines of Credit 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a consolidated cash balance of $  59.7   million. We also have an unsecured revolving line of credit of $1.1 billion and a secured revolving line of credit of $65 million. The availability under these facilities as of   September 30, 2016  , after considering outstanding balances and the outstanding letters of credit, was $949.2 million. Seventeen banks participate in our $1.1 billion revolving line of credit and the failure of one bank to fund a draw on our line does not negate the obligation of the other banks to fund their pro-rata shares. The unsecured line includes an accordion feature that would increase the borrowing capacity to as much as $1.5 billion if fully exercised, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments, customary closing conditions, and covenant compliance for the unencumbered asset pool. As of   September 30, 2016  , we could not fully utilize the accordion feature unless additional assets were added to our unencumbered asset pool. The $1.1 billion revolving line of credit matures in February 2019, with a one-year extension option. The facility bears interest at a range based on our total leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the leverage ratio resulted in a rate of LIBOR plus 1.30% with a 0.25% facility fee. 
    
  In April 2016, we extended our $65 million secured secondary revolving line of credit for one year upon maturity. All significant terms of the credit facility remain unchanged as a result of the extension. 
    
  Construction Financings 
    
  In addition to the revolving lines of credit described above, we have construction facilities outstanding for several centers recently opened or under construction, as described in the following paragraphs.  
    
  In October 2016, a refinancing was completed for our existing construction facility for The Mall at University Town Center, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The proceeds from the refinancing were used to pay off the $225 million balance of the existing LIBOR plus 1.70% floating rate construction facility, which was scheduled to mature in October 2016. See "Results of Operations - Debt and Equity Transactions" for more information on this refinancing. 
  We have a $320 million construction facility for The Mall of San Juan, a consolidated joint venture. As of   September 30, 2016  , $23.6 million was available under the construction facility. The facility, which matures in April 2017 and has two, one-year extension options, is interest-only for the entire term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which may decrease to LIBOR plus 1.75% upon achieving certain performance measures. No draws on the facility are permitted after the first extension date. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Upcoming Maturities" for more information.

We have a $330.9 million construction facility for International Market Place, a consolidated joint venture. As of   September 30, 2016  , $94.8 million was available under the construction facility. The facility, which matures in August 2018, has two, one-year extension options, and bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%, which may be reduced to LIBOR plus 1.60% upon the achievement of certain performance measures. The loan is interest-only during the initial three-year term and no draws on the loan are permitted after the original maturity date. During the extension period, debt service payments also include principal payments based on an assumed interest rate of 6.0% and a 30-year amortization.  
    
  Our joint venture has a non-recourse construction facility for Starfield Hanam. We have an effective 34.3% interest in the Unconsolidated Joint Venture. The financing consists of a five-year, 520 billion Korean Won (KRW) denominated construction facility (approximately $471.9 million U.S. dollars using the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) and a five-year U.S. dollar financing of $52.1 million. The U.S. dollar denominated portion of the financing is secured by an approximately $53.2 million standby letter of credit, which was drawn from the KRW denominated portion of the construction facility, thereby reducing the availability under the KRW denominated construction facility to approximately $418.7 million U.S. dollars as of   September 30, 2016  , excluding the amount drawn on the facility. The KRW denominated portion of the financing bears interest at the Korea Development Bank Five-Year Bond Yield plus 1.06% and is fixed upon each draw. The weighted average rate of the amount drawn at   September 30, 2016   is 2.58%. The U.S. dollar denominated floating rate facility bears interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. A cross-currency interest rate swap was executed to fix the interest rate on the U.S. dollar portion of the financing and swap the U.S. dollar denomination from U.S. dollars to KRW. As a result of the swap, the effective interest rate of the U.S. dollar portion of the financing is fixed at 3.12%. As of   September 30, 2016  , the U.S. dollar denominated portion of the financing was fully drawn, while $283.1 million U.S. dollars (using the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate) were drawn on the KRW denominated portion of the facility, bringing the total remaining availability of the facility to approximately $135.6 million U.S. dollars. 
    
  Our joint venture that owns CityOn.Zhengzhou has a construction facility on which we can borrow up to 834 million Chinese Yuan Renminbi (RMB) (approximately $125.2 million U.S. dollars using the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate). The 11-year financing bears interest at 130% of the RMB People's Bank of China base lending rate for a loan term greater than five years, which resets in January of each year. The rate on the debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016   was 6.37%. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately $51.7 million U.S. dollars were available under the construction facility using the   September 30, 2016   exchange rate. In July 2016, we acquired an additional interest in the Unconsolidated Joint Venture, increasing our effective ownership interest to 49% from the previous 32% effective interest (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Spending - New Developments"). 
    
  As a foreign investor, we are subject to various government approval processes and other hurdles in funding the construction of our Chinese projects. These hurdles have required our Xi'an and Zhengzhou ventures to obtain short-term financing, in the form of loans from our joint venture partner or fully cash collateralized bank loans, to meet certain construction funding commitments in local currency. As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of such loans was approximately $140 million. These loans have fixed interest rates that range from 4.7% to 8.0%. These loans are collateralized with restricted deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See "Note 2 - Acquisition, Redevelopments, Developments, and Service Agreement - Asia Development - Restricted Deposits" to our consolidated financial statements for current year funding of these restricted deposits. 
    
  Refer to "Note 5 - Beneficial Interest in Debt and Interest Expense" to our consolidated financial statements for further details of our construction financings and related guarantees.  
    
  Upcoming Maturities 
    
  In October 2016, upon maturity, we completed a 10-year, $280 million non-recourse refinancing of the construction facility for The Mall at University Town Center, a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint Venture. See "Results of Operations - Debt and Equity Transactions" for more information on this refinancing. 
  The construction facility for The Mall of San Juan matures in April 2017, and we are currently evaluating options related to exercising the initial one-year extension option, refinancing, or paying off of this construction facility. 
    
  The $65.0 million secured secondary revolving credit facility matures in April 2017. We will evaluate our options related to the extension of this facility.

Term Loan 
    
  Our $475 million unsecured term loan matures in February 2019. The loan includes an accordion feature that increases the borrowing capacity to as much as $600 million if fully exercised, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments, customary closing conditions, and covenant compliance for the unencumbered asset pool. As of   September 30, 2016  , we could not fully utilize the accordion feature unless additional assets were added to our unencumbered asset pool.  The term loan bears interest at a range based on our total leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the loan leverage ratio resulted in a rate of LIBOR plus 1.45%. The LIBOR rate is swapped until maturity to a fixed rate of 1.65%, which results in an effective interest rate in the range of 3.00% to 3.55%. 
    
  Acquisition 
    
  In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. Also in March 2016, our joint venture completed a 10-year, $320 million ($160 million at TRG s beneficial share) non-recourse financing on Country Club Plaza. The payments on the loan, which bears interest at an all-in fixed rate of 3.88%, are interest only for three years, and then amortizes principal based on 30 years.  
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  In August 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. In March 2015, our Board of Directors increased the authorization by $250 million, bringing the total authorization to $450 million. We may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions. Repurchases of common stock are financed through general corporate funds, including borrowings under our existing revolving lines of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , $145.1 million remained available under the repurchase program. See "Results of Operations - Debt and Equity Transactions" for more information on our share repurchase program.

Additions to properties in   2016   and   2015   related primarily to the costs of new centers under development as well as capital and tenant improvements at existing centers. A tabular presentation of   2016   and   2015   capital spending is shown in  Capital Spending.  Net cash proceeds from the sale of peripheral land were $11.3 million in 2016. Cash placed in escrow to fund certain construction projects was   $103.5 million   in 2016. In 2015,   $25.1 million   of cash in escrow was used to fund a redevelopment project. 
    
  Contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in   2016   and   2015   were $  42.3   million and   $73.7 million  , respectively, primarily related to the funding of Taubman Asia project costs. Additionally, in 2016, we contributed   $314.2 million   to an Unconsolidated Joint Venture in connection with the acquisition of Country Club Plaza. Distributions from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in excess of income were   $177.6 million   in   2016  , which is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the Country Club Plaza financing, and $0.1 million in 2015.

  Beneficial Interest in Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership's debt and its beneficial interest in the debt of its Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures totaled $4,284.7 million, with an average interest rate of 3.39% excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These costs are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. Interest expense includes non-cash amortization of premiums relating to acquisitions, if any. As of   September 30, 2016  , there are no unamortized premiums. Beneficial interest in debt includes debt used to fund development and expansion costs. Beneficial interest in construction work in progress totaled $363.6 million as of   September 30, 2016  , which includes $339.6 million of assets on which interest is being capitalized. The following table presents information about our beneficial interest in debt as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Represents weighted average interest rate before amortization of deferred financing costs. 
              (2) 
    Deferred financing costs include debt issuance costs including amortization of deferred financing costs from revolving lines of credit and other fees not listed above.

Sensitivity Analysis 
    
  We have exposure to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and interest rate instruments. We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings. We routinely use cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives. Based on the Operating Partnership's beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at   September 30, 2016  , a one percent increase in interest rates on this floating rate debt would decrease cash flows by approximately $10.1 million, and due to the effect of capitalized interest, decrease annual earnings by approximately $8.7 million. A one percent decrease in interest rates (or to zero percent for LIBOR rates that are below one percent) would increase cash flows by approximately $5.4 million and due to the effect of capitalized interest, increase annual earnings by approximately $4.7 million. Based on our consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at   September 30, 2016  , a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $155.8 million, while a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $172.4 million.  
    
  Loan Commitments and Guarantees 
    
  Certain loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants, including the following corporate covenants on our unsecured primary revolving line of credit, unsecured term loan, and the construction facilities on The Mall of San Juan and International Market Place: a minimum net worth requirement, a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum recourse secured debt ratio, and a maximum payout ratio. In addition, our primary revolving line of credit and term loan have unencumbered pool covenants, which currently apply to Beverly Center, Dolphin Mall, and Twelve Oaks Mall on a combined basis. These covenants include a minimum number and minimum value of eligible unencumbered assets, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a minimum unencumbered asset occupancy ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the corporate total leverage ratio was the most restrictive covenant. We are in compliance with all of our loan covenants and obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The maximum payout ratio covenant limits the payment of distributions generally to 95% of funds from operations, as defined in the loan agreements, except as required to maintain our tax status, pay preferred distributions, and for distributions related to the sale of certain assets. See "Note 5 - Beneficial Interest in Debt and Interest Expense" to our consolidated financial statements for more details on loan guarantees. 
    
  Cash Tender Agreement 
    
  TF Associates LLC and Taubman Ventures Group LLC have the right to tender partnership units in the Operating Partnership and cause us to purchase the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market valuation of TCO on the trading date immediately preceding the date of the tender except with respect to TCO s right to finance the purchase through the sale of new shares of its stock. See  Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies   Cash Tender  to our consolidated financial statements for more details.

  Acquisition 
    
  In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. See "Results of Operations - Acquisition - Country Club Plaza" for additional information regarding the acquisition. 
  New Developments 
    
  International Market Place, a 0.3 million square foot center, in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, opened in August 2016. The center is anchored by the only full-line Saks Fifth Avenue in Hawaii. Capital spending at the shopping center will continue subsequent to opening as construction continues on tenant spaces. We have a 93.5% interest in the shopping center and are funding all construction costs. This shopping center is subject to a participating ground lease.

Our joint venture with Wangfujing owns and manages a shopping center, CityOn.Xi'an, located at Xi'an Saigao City Plaza, a large-scale mixed-use development in Xi'an, China. The center opened in April 2016 and is part of a 5.9 million square foot mixed-use project. We invested in the retail portion only, which is about 1.0 million square feet with over half of that in mall specialty stores. In April 2016, the joint venture effectively acquired the 40% noncontrolling interest for approximately $150 million, increasing the partnership interest in the project to 100%. Our share of the purchase price for the additional interest was approximately $75 million. As a result of the acquisition, our effective ownership in the center is 50%, an increase from our previous 30% effective interest.  
    
  Our second joint venture with Wangfujing owns and will manage a shopping center to be located in Zhengzhou, China. Currently under construction, the approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping mall, CityOn.Zhengzhou, is scheduled to open in March 2017. In July 2016, we acquired an additional 17% interest in the project. As a result of the acquisition, our effective ownership in the center is 49%, an increase from our previous 32% effective interest. We expect our additional investment to be approximately $60 million, including the purchase price of the 17% interest as well as future funding of construction at our increased ownership percentage. As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of total project costs was $  157.5 million  , which was decreased by   $4.2 million   for the change in exchange rates. Our total anticipated investment, including capitalized interest, will now be approximately $175 million for a 49% equity interest. We are expecting a 6% to 6.5% unlevered return at stabilization. Remaining spending on the project may be funded using the remaining availability under the joint venture's construction facility (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Construction Financings" above). 
    
  Our joint venture with Shinsegae owns and manages an approximately 1.7 million square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea. The center opened in September 2016. We have partnered with a major institution in Asia for a 49% ownership interest in Starfield Hanam. The institutional partner owns 14.7% of the project, bringing our effective ownership to 34.3%.  
    
  Estimates of total project costs through completion in Asia exclude fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  
    
  Internally generated funds and excess proceeds from refinancings of maturing debt obligations, as well as borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, would be sufficient to finance the anticipated remaining costs of these projects, but we also expect additional proceeds from our construction loan financings (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Construction Financings" above).

  In March 2016, we announced our plans for the comprehensive renovation of Beverly Center. The project will cost approximately $500 million and is scheduled to be completed by the 2018 holiday season. The project will be a renovation of existing GLA and we expect a return of 3% to 4% at stabilization in 2020. The projected return was calculated using the estimated cash flow differential between two scenarios; a full renovation and a non-renovation scenario. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had capitalized costs of   $65.9 million   related to this redevelopment project. 
    
  We have an ongoing redevelopment project at The Mall at Green Hills that will add approximately 170,000 square feet of incremental GLA that we expect to be completed in 2019. The project will cost approximately $200 million, and we expect a return of 6.5% to 7.5% at stabilization. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had capitalized costs of   $62.5 million   related to this redevelopment project. 
    
  Disclosures regarding planned capital spending, including estimates regarding timing of openings, capital expenditures, occupancy, and returns on new developments are forward-looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to (1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants, and contractors, (2) timing and outcome of litigation and entitlement processes, (3) changes in the scope, number, and valuation of projects, (4) cost overruns, (5) timing of expenditures, (6) availability of and cost of financing and other financing considerations, (7) actual time to start construction and complete projects, (8) changes in economic climate, (9) competition from others attracting tenants and customers, (10) increases in operating costs, (11) timing of tenant openings, (12) early lease terminations and bankruptcies, and (13) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, estimates of capital spending will change as new projects are approved by our Board of Directors.

Dividends 
    
  We pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and preferred shareowners. Dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash available to us, our financial condition, capital and other requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners, as well as meet certain other requirements. We must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized, or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year. Such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on December 31 of the year in which they are declared. In addition, at our election, a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. These distributions qualify as dividends paid for the 90% REIT distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid. Preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends. 
    
  The annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated FFO available after preferred dividends and our REIT taxable income, as well as assessments of annual capital spending, financing considerations, and other appropriate factors. 
    
  Any inability of the Operating Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations, thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the Operating Partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends. 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.595 per common share, $0.40625 per share on our 6.5% Series J Preferred Stock, and $0.390625 per share on our 6.25% Series K Preferred Stock, all of which were paid on September 30, 2016 to shareowners of record on September 15, 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  We use NOI as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers, both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases. We define NOI as property-level operating revenues (includes rental income excluding straight-line adjustments of minimum rent) less maintenance, taxes, utilities, promotion, ground rent (including straight-line adjustments), and other property operating expenses. Since NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, pre-development charges, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from land and property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared period over period, reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties, as well as the impact on their operations from trends in mall tenant sales, occupancy and rental rates, and operating costs. We also use NOI excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period, which can affect comparability and trend analysis. We generally provide separate projections for expected NOI growth and our lease cancellation income. 
    
  The following reconciliations include the supplemental earnings measures of Beneficial interest in EBITDA and FFO. Beneficial interest in EBITDA represents our share of the earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. We believe Beneficial interest in EBITDA generally provides a useful indicator of operating performance, as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure. 
    
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items, sales of properties, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of REITs. We primarily use FFO in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation. 
    
  We may also present adjusted versions of NOI and FFO when used by management to evaluate our operating performance when certain significant items have impacted our results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items. In addition to the reasons noted above for each measure, we believe the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand management's view on comparability of such measures between periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we adjusted FFO to exclude the lump sum payment of $21.7 million we received in connection with the termination of our third party leasing agreement at Crystals (see "Results of Operations - The Shops at Crystals"). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, upon the announcement of an executive management transition, we reversed certain prior period share-based compensation expense, for which we adjusted FFO. 
    
  Our presentations of NOI, Beneficial interest in EBITDA, FFO, and adjusted versions of these measures, if any, are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of our operating performance. Additionally, these measures do not represent cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as defined by GAAP. Reconciliations of Net Income Attributable to Taubman Centers, Inc. Common Shareowners to Funds from Operations and Net Income to Net Operating Income are presented in the following section.

Reconciliation of Net Income to Net Operating Income 

(1) 
    Amount includes the lump sum payment of $21.7 million received in May 2016 in connection with the termination of our third party leasing agreement for Crystals due to a change in ownership of the center. 
              (2) 
    In 2016, we stopped allocating certain corporate-level operating expenses to the centers to better reflect the performance of the centers without regard to corporate infrastructure. These expenses, which were previously recognized in other operating expenses of the centers, are now recognized in unallocated operating expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the comparative amount of other operating expenses allocated to the centers was $3.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively, at 100%. 
              (3) 
    Includes Beverly Center, CityOn.Xi'an, Country Club Plaza, International Market Place, The Mall of San Juan, Starfield Hanam, and certain post-closing adjustments relating to the portfolio of centers sold to Starwood.  
     (4)      See "Non-GAAP Measures - Use of Non-GAAP Measures" above for a discussion of the use and utility of Net Operating Income excluding lease cancellation income as a performance measure.

    Controls and Procedures 
       
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods prescribed by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  In August 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to   $200 million   of our outstanding common stock. In March 2015, our Board of Directors increased the authorization by   $250 million  , bringing the total authorization to   $450 million  . We may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions. No shares have been repurchased in 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , we cumulatively repurchased   4,247,867   shares of our common stock at an average price of   $71.79   per share for a total of   $304.9 million   under the authorization. As of   September 30, 2016  , $145.1 million remained available under the repurchase program. All shares repurchased have been cancelled. For each share of our stock repurchased, one of our Operating Partnership units was redeemed. Repurchases of common stock were financed through general corporate funds, including borrowings under our existing revolving lines of credit. 
    
  The restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock are set forth in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends."
