Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 2016

NOTE 1.                              BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

In August 2009 the Company initiated a number of corporate changes, including 1), a name change to TOA Distribution Systems Inc, (formerly known as Skyhigh Resources Inc, 2) approved a 10 for 1 roll forward of its issued and outstanding common stock, 3), increased it authorized par value $0.001 common shares to 250,000,000 shares (formerly 50,000,000), and 4), authorized 10,000,000 par value $0.001 preferred shares.

In mid-2009, the Company resolved to change its corporate focus, moving from mining and exploration into bottled drinking water distribution.

The Company owned two (2) mineral properties acquired from related parties in January 2008 by issuing stock to related parties. The purchase price was fully impaired. In February 2012 these claims were deemed surplus and were sold in May 2012.

On September 2, 2009 the Company entered into to a Sub-Distribution agreement with Taste of Aruba (US), Inc to distribute bottled water products produced in Aruba by Taste of Aruba-Premium Aruban Water.   The territory in which the Company can distribute these products include the United States and all its territories and insular areas in the Caribbean and Pacific such as but not limited to Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Marshall Islands, and Guam, and all of Canada.  In January 2016, the Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the Sub-Distribution agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either party. Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would be available for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover the cost of the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were cancelled on January18, 2016. This transaction which included full impairment has been reversed in the financial records for the year ended March 31, 2016.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions  . 

NOTE 2.                              GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company has no business operations to date, accumulated losses amounting to $178,776 and must secure additional financing to commence the Company's plan of operations, which means there is substantial concern about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company intends to acquire additional operating capital through equity offerings to the public to fund its business plan or loans from shareholders and others. There is no assurance that the equity offerings will be successful or loans will be received to provide sufficient funds to commence operations or to assure the eventual profitability of the Company.

NOTE 3.                              SUB-DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT 

On September 2, 2009 the Company signed an Exclusive Sub-Distribution Agreement ("Agreement") with Taste of Aruba (US) Inc, a State of Nevada Incorporated company, owner and master distributor of products from Taste of Aruba-Premium Aruban Water. Under the Agreement, the Company would have  distributed in the United States, its territories and insular areas in the Caribbean and Pacific and Canada, bottled water produced under license in Aruba by Water Energy Company-Aruba.

NOTE 3.                              SUB-DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (cont'd) 

In January 2016, the Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the Sub-Distribution agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either party. Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would be available for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover the cost of the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were cancelled on January18, 2016. This transaction which included full impairment has been reversed in the financial records for the year ended March 31, 2016.

T he Company periodically reviews for impairment its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management has determined that its Distribution Agreement asset requires impairment. As no sale activities have occurred, no product is yet available for sale and funds to establish a sales and distribution operation have not been secured. 

NOTE 4.                              LOANS PAYABLE 

Loans payable to related parties, were received from a director of the Company and others closely associated persons or businesses. These funds were provided as cash loans to cover operating expenses and as payment for services provided.

Loans payable to the past and current presidents totaled $6,306 made up of principal amounting to $3,742 and accrued interest of $2,564

Loans payable to a closely associated business totaled 93,219 made up of principal amounting to $78,815 and accrued interest amounting to $14,404.

In aggregate, Loans Payable Related Parties to September 30, 2016 totaled $99,526 made up of $82,558 for principal and $16,968 for accrued interest.

NOTE 5.                              EQUITY 

At a special shareholders meeting held August 13, 2009, the shareholders approved the change of the Company's name to TOA Distribution Systems Inc, approved charges to the authorized capital which included creation of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.01 per share and increased the authorized common stock to 250,000,000 with a par value of $0.001 per share. As well, the shareholders approved a 10 for 1 forward stock split of the outstanding shares. All share amounts shown in these financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to account for the forward stock split.

At  September 30, 2016  we had zero preferred stock issued and outstanding and had 30,100,060 common shares issued and outstanding, which were issued on the dates and purposes listed below.

-  15,000,000 common shares issued to a director for cash at $0.0001 on December 13, 2007

-  600,000 common shares issued for services at $0.0025 on December 13, 2007

-  2,000,000 common shares issued for a mining property at $0.01 on January10, 2007

- (17,000,000) common shares returned for cancelled sub-distribution agreement January18, 2016

NOTE 6.                              CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS 

The Company owned two (2) mineral claims that had been deemed surplus and fully impaired. On May 1, 2012 these claims were sold to a related party to whom the Company had loans payable. The terms of the sale was a reduction of the loans payable and proportionate accrued interest in aggregate amounting to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollar, ($25,000.00), an extension on the due date of these loan payable, a reduction of the rate of interest payable from 10% to 5% and the issuance by the purchaser, of shares in its two private companies. The Company elected to distribute these private company shares equally to the Company's shareholders. As these shares were valued at $0 by the Company there was no impact on the financial statements.

NOTE 7.                              CHANGES TO GENERALLY ACCEAPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) 

During the September 30, 2014 period the Company adopted the revised Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-10 that removes the definition of a development stage entity from ASC Topic 915 under GAAP, which become effective  
 December 15, 2014 while permitting Companies to adopt these guidelines earlier

NOTE 8.                              SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued. There were no significant subsequent events that need to be disclosed.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

PLAN OF OPERATION

In an effort to make available the facilities of the public market to our funding requirements, the Company intends to make application to FINRA for a trading symbol. The Company's application to FINRA will consist of current corporate information, financial statements and other documents as required by Rule 15c211 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On November 17, 2012, the Company filed a Form 8-K, Item 5.02: Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This 8-K filing disclosed the resignation of Trevor Blank as a Director and from all officer positions held with the Company. Concurrent with Mr. Blank's resignation, Mr. Andy Ruppanner was appointed to serve as sole director and as President and CEO, Vice-President and CFO, Secretary and Treasurer.

In January 2016 the Company's and Taste of Aruba mutually agreed to cancel their Sub-Distribution Agreement.  Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would be available for resale. The cancelation agreement was on the basis of a no loss, no gain for either party. The 17,000,000 shares issued as the cost for the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and cancelled.

Subsequent to the period ending June 30, 2016, the Company entered into discussion with another non related entity to obtain a license for a water treatment technology. As of this filing date nothing had been finalized.

SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash balance was nil on September 30, 2016. During this three month period ended September 30, 2016   we received loans from related parties amounting to $3,318 and have a commitment for any additional funds required to fund our limited levels of operations through March 31, 2017. We have not generated any revenue to date.

We have loans payable including interest amounting to $99,526 due March 31, 2017.

Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated for the immediate future. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM 3.                              CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Security and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the current quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

EVALUATION OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.  Internal  control  over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our  financial  reporting  purposes  accordance  with  accounting  principles generally  accepted in the United  States of  America.  Internal  control  over financial  reporting  includes  maintaining  records that in  reasonable  detail accurately and fairly reflect our transaction;  providing  reasonable  assurance that  transactions  are recorded as necessary for  preparations of our financial statements;  providing  reasonable assurance that receipts and  expenditures of company  assets  are  made in  accordance  with  management  authorization;  and providing   reasonable   assurance  that  unauthorized   acquisitions,   use  or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2016. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period  ended  September 30, 2016 that have  materially  affected,  or are reasonable  likely to materially  affect our internal control over financial reporting.
