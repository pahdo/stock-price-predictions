      Table of Contents           NASCENT BIOTECH, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)       NOTE 1    ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS       Nascent Biotech, Inc. ( Nascent  or the  Company  ) was incorporated on March 3, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is actively developing its primary asset Pritumumab for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Nascent is also actively researching other cancers that have a high probability of benefiting from the therapeutic effects of Pritumumab because they share a common target. Pritumumab has shown to be very effective at low doses in previous clinical studies in Japan      Nascent is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The Company focuses on biologic drug candidates that are undergoing or have already completed initial clinical testing for the treatment of brain and pancreatic cancer and then seek to further develop those drug candidates for commercial use. Nascent currently own the rights to a drug candidate, Pritumumab, which the Company is developing.        NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on March 31.     The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarters or for an entire year.       NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company, as shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, has working capital of $383,370 as September 30, 2016. The Company had incurred net losses since inception until the period ended September 30, 2016 in which the Company posted net income of $2,168,597 from a license sale to a pharmaceutical company in China. The Company has a source of revenue to cover its operating costs, however the source of revenue is not predictable and the Company will incur additional expenses in the future developing their product. These factors may raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will engage in research and development activities that must be satisfied in cash secured through outside funding. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.                  6       
      Table of Contents           NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS      On September 1, 2015, the Company entered five-year employment contracts with three of its officers and directors. Under the terms of the agreements the Company issued shares of common stock to the officers and directors equaling 11% of the outstanding shares of the Company as of the date of the contracts. As additional future shares are issued, the officers and directors are entitled to additional shares so their aggregate ownership percentage remains at 11% of the outstanding shares of the Company. The following table sets forth the shares earned under these contracts as of September 30, 2016:           In addition, if the officers and directors are removed from the company they are entitled to receive a cash severance payment per annum for each year of the term of the contract less salary payments received to date of termination. The table below sets forth the annual salary and annual severance amounts per the contracts:           During the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 22,550 shares of common stock to three officers with a value of $9,334 for service.     On July 22, 2016, the Company increased the base compensation for each officer by $2,000 per month as entitled by their compensation agreements.      NOTE 5   LICENSE LIABILITY      The Company holds a license from a third party for certain patents and related material related to Pritumumab. The license allows the Company to develop, manufacture and sell its product worldwide using the patents under the license agreement. The license was entered by Nascent Biologics, Inc. in March 2009 granting rights to the development and certain patents. The license was granted for total consideration of $2,000,000, to be paid in six installments of $300,000 plus a final payment of $200,000 on January 1, 2016. In addition, the license provides the licensor with a royalty of 2% on the sales of the developed product, up to $10,000,000 in sales, and thereafter, a royalty of 1% for all sales over $10,000,000. Prior to the acquisition by the Company, Nascent Biologics allowed 10 patents to expire based on their assessment of the patents and their value relating to the Company s development of its product. Nascent Biologics and the licensor amended the license agreement requiring payments of $333,000 per year from January 1, 2012 through January 1, 2015. Such payments were not made by Nascent Biologic or the Company after the acquisition of Nascent Biologic.                   7       
      Table of Contents          On September 21, 2015, the Company and the licensor amended their agreement where the licensor received a $30,000 cash payment and will receive $1,000 per month for 28 months plus a $5,000 additional payment on the 28th month. In addition, the licensor received 200,000 shares of the Company s common stock, plus will receive 1% of net sales of the Company s product up to $1,000,000 in royalties. The fair value of the stock issued was determined to be $150,000 and the transaction resulted in a gain on settlement of license agreement liability of $1,573,650. The remaining liability, as of September 30, 2016 of $20,000, will be paid over 15 months.      NOTE 6   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES      On May 20, 2014, the Company granted 13,317 common stock warrants for services. The warrants vest immediately, are exercisable at $1.00 per share and expire on May 21, 2017. The Company determined that the warrants were not afforded equity classification because the warrants are not considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock due to the anti-dilution provision. Accordingly, the warrants are treated as a derivative liability and are carried at fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of these derivative warrants at each balance sheet date and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the statement of operations under the caption  loss on change in fair value of derivative liability  until the derivative warrants are exercised or expire. The Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to estimate the fair value of the derivative liability as of the date of issuance and as of September 30, 2016 using the following key inputs: market price of the Company s common stock $0.10 to $1.51 per share, volatility of 250% and discount rate of 0.13%. The fair value of the derivative liability was determined to be $3,849 as of March 31, 2016 and $2,793 as of September 30, 2016 which resulted in a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,056 for the six months ended September 30, 2016.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses and shareholder loans. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.     Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into the following levels:     Level 1  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.      Level 2  quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.     Level 3  Inputs reflecting management s best estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the instruments.     A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.                  8       
      Table of Contents          Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016:           The following table summarizes the change in the fair value of the derivative liability during the six months ended September 30, 2016:            NOTE 7   COMMON STOCK      During the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock with a value of $75,000 for the settlement of $410,000 of accounts payable realizing a gain on settlement of accounts payable of $335,000.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERTIONS       This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth on the forward-looking statements because of the risks set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, general economic conditions, and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements.     Nascent Biotech, Inc ( Nascent  or the  Company ) was incorporated on March 3, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is actively developing its primary asset Pritumumab for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Nascent is also actively researching other cancers that have a high probability of benefiting from the therapeutic effects of Pritumumab because they share a common target. Pritumumab has shown to be very effective at low doses in previous clinical studies in Japan.      Nascent is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The Company focuses on biologic drug candidates that are undergoing or have already completed initial clinical testing for the treatment of cancer and then seek to further develop those drug candidates for commercial use. Nascent currently own the license rights to a drug candidate, pritumumab, which the Company is developing.      Overview      The Company is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. We focus on biologic drug candidates that are undergoing or have already completed initial clinical testing for the treatment of cancer and then seek to further develop those drug candidates for commercial use. We currently own the license rights to a drug candidate, pritumumab which we are developing for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer both of which we hold orphan drug status granted by the FDA.     Initially we are focused on developing pritumumab for the treatment of patients with brain cancer malignancies such as gliomas and astrocytomas. Pritumumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been tested on 249 brain cancer patients and reviewed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan. The objective of the Phase I and Phase II human clinical trial was to determine the safety of pritumumab in humans and its efficacy in eliminating tumors or reducing tumor size in patients with brain cancer. These clinical trials were conducted at 22 clinical sites within Japan during a 14-year time (1988 to 2002). Except for 17 patients that were treated for a period of four weeks in a Phase I (safety) study (1mg per week dosage), all patients were dosed at 1 mg, either once or twice per week, for 24 weeks, and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy. The sponsor of those trials was the Hagiwara Institute of Health (HIH). Manufacturing of Pritumumab was done by Japan Pharmaceutical Development Company-a pharmaceutical contract manufacturing company, and all pre-clinical development work was performed at HIH. At the end of the Phase II trial, the HIH was approved for expanded Phase III trials in humans; however, the founder of HIH passed away and the clinical development of Pritumumab was suspended. A concern at that time was the ability to manufacture enough pritumumab to continue clinical trials. The product has never been approved for sale in Japan or elsewhere. Current therapeutic strategies for brain cancer include the use of the chemotherapy, surgical intervention or Radiation Therapy. Because these treatments have marginal outcomes there exists a need to develop safer, more effective drugs. Temodar-the most commonly used Chemotherapeutic drug used to treat brain cancer, is attributed to only median rates of survival and many brain tumors are eligible for surgery. Moreover, even when removed, most brain tumors come back within one year post-operation. Today, with current standards of care, less than 60% of all brain cancer patients will live past the first year after diagnosis, and less than 35% of patients will live to five years. Glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer that constitutes 42% of ALL brain and other nervous system cancers, has survival rates of 36.5% at 1yr and 5% at 5 yrs. (SEER Registry Data, June 15 th , 2016 (Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States)).      Results of Operations      The Company recorded $3,000,000 revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2016 for a license agreement for the Republic of China and zero revenue in 2015.            General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was $704,846 and $910,068 compared to $3,793,858 and $3,954,088 in 2015, respectively. This increase in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 over the same period in 2016 was due to stock grants to the management of the Company in 2015.     Research and development expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was $108,021 compared to $27,371 and $627,422 in the same period in 2015. This increase in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 reflected added toxically tests for the product to be used in the clinical studies which are estimated to commence in the first calendar quarter of 2017.     Total other income (expense) incurred in the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,844 and ($54,129), compared to other expense of $20,970 and $57,182 in the same period in 2015. The major change between 2016 and 2015 was due to the decrease in applicable interest expense from the outstanding accounts payable settled on June 30, 2016. Change in fair value derivative liability showed a gain of $1,056 for the six-month period in 2016 compared to a gain of fair value of $3,094 for the six-month period in 2015.     For the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016, our net income was $1,495,625 and $2,168,597 compared to a net loss of $2,268,549 and $3,065,042 for the same periods in 2015. The difference between the periods in 2016 and 2015 reflects the sale of the license agreement resulting in income of $3,000,000 in the six-month period ended September 30, 2016 with no revenue in the same period in 2015.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      The Company s liquidity and capital is dependent on the capital it can raise to continue the Company s development and testing of its product. The Company projects it has significant cash to continue its present operations through December, 2016.      There are no agreements or understandings about future loans by or with the officers, directors, principals, affiliates or shareholders of the Company. The Company will continue to raise outside capital through loans and equity sales.     At September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $383,370. Current assets consist of cash of $376,814 and prepaid of $145,500. Current liabilities as of the same date were $138,944 consisting of accounts payable of $116,151, license liability of $20,000, and derivative liability of $2,793.     Net cash used in operating activities in the six-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $196,786 compared to net cash used of $650,161 in the same period in 2015. The variance between the same periods in 2016 and 2015 relates mainly to the income from license sale and decrease in accounts payable of $2,486,273 offsetting the net profit of $2,168,597 in 2016 compared to a net loss of $3,065,042 offset by an increase in accounts payable of $259,118 and gain on license agreement of $1,573,650 in the same period in 2015.     Net cash provided by financing activities for the six-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $250 compared to $585,000 in the same period in 2015. Cash provided was a result of the conversion of warrants to common stock of $250 in 2016 and from the sale of common stock of $645,000 in 2015.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company had total assets of $1,350,278 and total liabilities of $138,944. Stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 was $1,211,334. This compares to a stockholders  deficit of $1,568,779 as of March 31, 2016. Liabilities decreased in 2016 due mainly to the completion of the license agreement of which $3,000,000 was recognized as revenue in the current period.             NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING:       Our current capital needs are estimated to be approximately $8 million. This will take us through Phase I/II clinical trials which are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2017.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We had no off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at September 30, 2016.      Inflation      We believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception.       ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable.       ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Under the supervision and the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2016 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. Such conclusion reflects the identification of material weakness as follows: (1) lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function, and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review.  Until we can remedy these material weaknesses, we have engaged third party consultants and accounting firm to assist with financial reporting.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       None       ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS       There have been no material changes to Nascent Biotech s risk factors as previously disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K filing.       ITEM 2: SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS .      During the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock with a value of $75,000 for the settlement of $410,000 of accounts payable realizing a gain on settlement of accounts payable of $335,000.     On August 4, 2016, the Company issued 30,000 shares of common stock to an entity with a value of $9,789 for service.     On September 9, 2016, the Company issued 25,000 shares of common stock with a value of $250 for the conversion of 25,000 warrants at $0.01 per share.     During the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 22,550 shares of common stock to three officers with a value of $9,334 for service.       ITEM 3: DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.       None       ITEM 4: MINE SAFETY INFORMATION       None       ITEM 5: OTHER INFORMATION       None.
