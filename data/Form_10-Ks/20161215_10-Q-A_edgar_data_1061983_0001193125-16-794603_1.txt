    EXPLANATORY NOTE    
 This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (this  Form 10-Q/A ) to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2016, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on November 3, 2016 (the  Original Filing ), is being filed for the purpose of restating our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and corresponding financial data. As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed on December 12, 2016, the restatement is the result of an error in the accounting for the recognition of clinical research
and development expenses.    Our management has determined that there was a design deficiency in our internal controls over financial
reporting due to the existence of a material weakness that resulted in an error identified. As of September 30, 2016, due to the existence of this material weakness, management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective, see Part I   Item 4 of this Form 10-Q/A for further information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For a discussion of management s consideration of our disclosure controls and procedures
and the material weakness identified, see Part I   Item 4 included in this Form 10-Q/A.    For reasons discussed above, we are filing
this Form 10-Q/A in order to amend the following items in our Original Filing to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments discussed above and restate corresponding financial data cited elsewhere in this Form 10-Q/A:  

Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)        

Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        

Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures        

Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors      In accordance with applicable SEC rules, this Form 10-Q/A
includes new certifications required by Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) from our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer dated as of the date of filing this Form 10-Q/A.  
 This Form 10-Q/A amends and restates in its entirety each section of the Original Filing impacted as a result of the restatement. Each section
that has been restated is noted in Note 1 to the financial statements. This Form 10-Q/A has not been updated to reflect events occurring after November 3, 2016, the date of the Original Filing. Therefore, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in
conjunction with filings we have made with the SEC subsequent to November 3, 2016.

   Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    
 On December 9, 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after discussion with management and the Company s
independent registered public accountants determined that there was an error in the accounting of the recognition of clinical trial research and development expenses and related balance sheet accounts. The following is a summary of the restatement
changes made to the financial statements previously filed as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Condensed

     Overview    
 Cytokinetics, Incorporated (the  Company ,  we  or  our ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of
Delaware on August 5, 1997. The Company is a late stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and
medical conditions.    The Company s financial statements contemplate the conduct of the Company s operations in the normal course
of business. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $525.4 million since inception and there can be no assurance that the Company will attain consistent profitability. The Company had a net income of $9.3 million and net cash used in
operations of $40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased from $111.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $86.3 million at September 30, 2016. The Company anticipates that
it will continue to have operating losses and net cash outflows in future periods.    The Company is subject to risks common to clinical
stage biopharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to, development of new drug candidates, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed, to fund its future plans. The Company s liquidity will be
impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to the Company. To date, the Company has funded its operations primarily through sales of its common stock and convertible preferred stock, contract payments under its
collaboration agreements, debt financing arrangements, government grants and interest income. Until it achieves profitable operations, the Company intends to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations, additional
sales of equity securities, grants and debt financings. The Company has never generated revenues from commercial sales of its drugs and may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever. The Company s success is dependent on its
ability to enter into new strategic collaborations and/or raise additional capital and to successfully develop and market one or more of its drug candidates. As a result, the Company may choose to raise additional capital through equity or debt
financings to continue to fund its operations in the future. The Company cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available from such a financing or through a collaborator when required or on satisfactory terms. Additionally, there can be no
assurance that the Company s drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s future
financial results, financial position and cash flows.    Based on the current status of its research and development plans, the Company
believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2016 will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If, at any time, the Company s prospects for financing its
research and development programs decline, the Company may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying, discontinuing or reducing its funding of one or more of its research or development programs. Alternatively, the Company might
raise funds through strategic collaborations, public or private financings or other arrangements. Such funding, if needed, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.

    Basis of Presentation    
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cytokinetics and its wholly owned subsidiary. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. The financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that management believes are necessary for the fair statement of the Company s position at September 30,
2016, and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These interim financial statement results are not necessarily indicative of results
to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future interim period. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP for complete financial statements. The financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the interim financial statements have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with
the SEC on March 3, 2016.    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash
payments .  ASU 2016-15 issued guidance to clarify how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements or disclosures.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard would have on its financial statements and disclosures.    In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Stock compensation (Topic 718).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies various aspects of accounting for share-based payments and presentation in the financial statements .  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard would have on its financial statements and disclosures.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  ASU 2016-02 requires management to record right-to-use asset
and lease liability on the statement of financial position for operating leases .  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018 and modified retrospective approach is required.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard would have on its financial statements and disclosures.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial instruments (Subtopic 825-10).  ASU 2016-01 requires management to measure
equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements or disclosures.    In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 214-15 requires management to assess an
entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and early
adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements or disclosures.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which requires an entity to recognize the
amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In March 2016, the FASB amended
the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the new standard. In April 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance on licensing in the new standard. In May
2016, the FASB amended the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition in the new standard. The new standard will become effective for us on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted to the
original effective date of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the potential impact this standard may have on our
financial position and results of operations.

   Note 2   Net Income (Loss) Per Share   
 The following is the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):  
   
   Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of vested
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, including outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock units, warrants, and shares
issuable under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ), by applying the treasury stock method, if they have a dilutive effect. The following instruments were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per
share because their effect would have been antidilutive (in thousands):

   Note 4   Related Party Research and Development Arrangements   
   Amgen Inc. ( Amgen )      In
December 2006, the Company entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Amgen to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics, including omecamtiv mecarbil, that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential
applications in the treatment of heart failure (the  Amgen Agreement ). The agreement granted Amgen an option to obtain an exclusive license worldwide, except Japan, to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates
arising from the collaboration. In May 2009, Amgen exercised its option. As a result, Amgen became responsible for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds at its expense worldwide (excluding Japan), subject
to the Company s development and commercialization participation rights. Amgen reimburses the Company for certain research and development activities it performs under the collaboration.  
 In June 2013, Cytokinetics and Amgen executed an amendment to the Amgen Agreement to include Japan, resulting in a worldwide collaboration
(the  Amgen Agreement Amendment ). Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement Amendment, the Company received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $15.0 million in June 2013. Under the Amgen Agreement Amendment, the Company conducted a
Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study intended to support inclusion of Japan in a potential Phase 3 clinical development program and potential global registration dossier for omecamtiv mecarbil. Amgen reimbursed the Company for the costs of this study. In
addition, the Company is eligible to receive additional pre-commercialization milestone payments relating to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and royalties on sales of omecamtiv mecarbil in Japan.  
 In conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, the Company also entered into a common stock purchase agreement which provided for the sale
of 1,404,100 shares of its common stock to Amgen at a price per share of $7.12 and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million, which was received in June 2013. The Company determined the fair value of the stock issued to Amgen to be
$7.5 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $2.5 million was initially deferred and allocated between the license and services based on their relative selling prices using best estimate of selling price. The allocated
consideration was recognized as revenue as revenue criteria were satisfied, or as services were performed over approximately 12 months. Pursuant to this agreement, Amgen agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect to the
Company s common stock.    The Company determined that the license to the Japan territory granted under the Amgen Agreement Amendment
was a separate, non-contingent deliverable under the amendment. The Company determined that the license has stand-alone value based on Amgen s internal product development capabilities since all relevant manufacturing know-how related to
omecamtiv mecarbil was previously delivered to Amgen.    In October 2013, the Company determined that the revenue recognition requirements
under ASC 605-10 had been met and accordingly, recognized $17.2 million in license revenue attributable to the Amgen Agreement Amendment in the fourth quarter of 2013. In year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized the remaining $0.3
million of the previously deferred consideration attributable to the Amgen Agreement Amendment as research and development revenues from related parties.  
 Amgen and the Company agreed to extend the term of the research program in 2016. Under the amended Amgen Agreement, the Company is entitled to
receive reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents during 2016, as well as potential additional milestone payments related to the research activities.  
 Under the Amgen Agreement, as amended, the Company is eligible to receive over $350.0 million in development milestone payments which are
based on various clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the receipt of such approvals. These clinical milestones
include an approximately $27.0 million milestone relating to the start of GALACTIC-HF. Additionally, the Company is eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in commercial milestone payments provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature
of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments would become due. The achievement of each of these
milestones is dependent solely upon the results of Amgen s development and commercialization activities and therefore none of these milestones was deemed to be substantive. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company recognized no revenues for milestones achieved under the Amgen Agreement.    The Amgen Agreement also provides for the
Company to receive increased royalties by co-funding Phase 3 development costs of omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates under the collaboration. If the Company elects to co-fund such costs, it would be entitled to co-promote the co-funded
drug in North America and participate in agreed commercialization activities in institutional care settings, at Amgen s expense.    In
July 2013, Amgen announced that it had granted an option to commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe to Servier, with the Company s consent, pursuant to an Option, License and Collaboration Agreement (the  Servier Agreement ).  
      Page 11  

Table of Contents  

  In August 2016, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with Amgen and Servier (the
 Letter Agreement ), which (i) expands the territory of the sublicense to Servier to include specified countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) and (ii) provides that, if Amgen s rights under the Amgen
Agreement, as amended, are terminated with respect to the territory of such sublicense, the sublicensed rights previously granted by Amgen to Servier under the Servier Agreement will remain in effect and become a direct license or sublicense of such
rights by us to Servier, on substantially the same terms as set forth in the Servier Agreement, including but not limited to Servier s payment of its share of agreed development costs and future milestone and royalty payments to us. The Letter
Agreement does not otherwise modify our rights and obligations under the Amgen Agreement, as amended, or create any additional financial obligations of the Company, unless we otherwise agree in writing.  
 In September 2016, Amgen and Servier announced Servier s decision to exercise its option to commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe as
well as the CIS, including Russia. The option and related commercialization sublicense to Servier is subject to the terms and conditions of the Amgen Agreement. Amgen remains responsible for the performance of its obligations under the Amgen
Agreement relating to Europe and the CIS, including the payment of milestones and royalties relating to the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the CIS.  
 Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, the Company has recognized research and development revenue from Amgen for reimbursements of internal costs
of certain full-time employee equivalents, supporting a collaborative research program directed to the discovery of next-generation cardiac sarcomere activator compounds and of other costs related to that research program. These reimbursements were
recorded as research and development revenues from related parties. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and development revenue from Amgen of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively,
under the Amgen Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and development revenue from Amgen of $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, under the Amgen Agreement.

     Astellas Pharma Inc. ( Astellas )    
  Original Astellas Agreement (Non-neuromuscular license)   
 In June 2013, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Astellas (the  Original Astellas Agreement ). The
primary objective of the collaboration with Astellas is to advance novel therapies for diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness.  
 Under the Original Astellas Agreement, the Company granted Astellas an exclusive license to co-develop and jointly commercialize CK-2127107, a
fast skeletal troponin activator, for potential application in non-neuromuscular indications worldwide. The Company was primarily responsible for the conduct of Phase 1 clinical trials and certain Phase 2 readiness activities for CK-2127107 and
Astellas was primarily responsible for the conduct of subsequent development and commercialization activities for CK-2127107.    In July
2013, the Company received an upfront, non-refundable license fee of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. Under the agreement, the Company was eligible to potentially receive over $24.0 million in
reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration. The Original Astellas Agreement also provided for research and early and late stage development milestone payments based on various
research and clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission for approval of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the commercial launch of collaboration products, and
royalties on sales of commercialized products.

  At the inception of the Original Astellas Agreement, the Company deferred revenue related to the
Original Astellas Agreement in accordance with ASC 605-25. The Company evaluated whether the delivered elements under the arrangement have value on a stand-alone basis. Upfront, non-refundable licensing payments are assessed to determine whether or
not the licensee is able to obtain stand-alone value from the license. Where this is not the case, the Company does not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting, and the revenue for the license fee is deferred and
recognized in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting.    The Company determined that the
license and the research and development services are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, the Company is recognizing this revenue using the proportional performance model over the
initial research term of the Original Astellas Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded zero and $0.1 million, respectively, in license revenue based on the proportional performance model.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded zero dollars and $2.2 million, respectively, in license revenue based on the proportional performance model. No license revenue remains deferred under the Original
Astellas Agreement as of September 30, 2016.    Pursuant to the Original Astellas Agreement, the Company recognized research and
development revenue from Astellas for reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents, supporting collaborative research and development programs, and of other costs related to those programs. During the three months ended
September, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and development revenue from Astellas of zero and $0.2 million, respectively, under the Original Astellas Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recorded research and development revenue from Astellas of zero and $3.4 million, respectively, under the Original Astellas Agreement.     2014 Astellas
Agreement (Expansion to include neuromuscular indications)     In December 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated
license and collaboration agreement with Astellas (the  2014 Astellas Agreement ). This agreement superseded the Original Astellas Agreement. The 2014 Astellas Agreement expanded the objective of the collaboration of advancing novel
therapies for diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness to include spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and potentially other neuromuscular indications with CK-2127107 and other fast skeletal troponin activators, in addition to the
non-neuromuscular indications provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement.    Under the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the Company received a
non-refundable upfront license fee of $30.0 million in January 2015. Concurrently, the Company received $15.0 million as a milestone payment relating to Astellas  decision to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development. Under the
2014 Astellas Agreement, the Company is conducting the initial Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with SMA. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive additional pre-commercialization milestone payments related to the development
of CK-2127107 in neuromuscular indications, and royalties on sales of CK-2127107 in neuromuscular indications.    The Company determined
that the license and the research and development services relating to the 2014 Astellas Agreement are a single unit of accounting as the license was determined to not have stand-alone value. Accordingly, the Company is recognizing this revenue over
the research term of the 2014 Astellas Agreement using the proportional performance model.    During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $3.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in license revenue based on the proportional performance model under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $9.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively, in license revenue based on the proportional performance model under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, $10.3 million license revenue remains
deferred under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the Company recognized research and development revenue from Astellas for reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents, supporting
collaborative research and development programs, and of other costs related to those programs. The Company is eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the three
years of the collaboration through 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and development revenue from Astellas of $3.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, under the 2014 Astellas
Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and development revenue from Astellas of $9.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, under the 2014 Astellas Agreement.

  In conjunction with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the Company also entered into a common stock
purchase agreement which provided for the sale of 2,040,816 shares of its common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90 and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million which was received in December 2014. Pursuant to this agreement,
Astellas agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect to the Company s common stock. The Company determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $0.9
million was deferred along with the license and research and development services. Allocated consideration will be recognized as revenue for the single unit of accounting above, as services are performed following the proportional performance model
over the research term of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Following the common stock purchase, Astellas was determined to be a related party. As such, all revenue earned following the common stock purchase is classified as related party revenue.  
  2016 Astellas Amendment (Inclusion of ALS as an Added Indication and Option on Tirasemtiv)   
 On July 27, 2016, the Company and Astellas entered into an amendment (the  2016 Amendment ) to expand their collaboration on the
research, development and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators under the 2014 Astellas Agreement (collectively, the  Current Astellas Agreement ).  
 Under the 2016 Amendment, the Company granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the
development and commercialization of tirasemtiv ( Option on Tirasemtiv ). If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights outside of the Company s commercialization territory of
North America, Europe and other select countries. Tirasemtiv is the Company s fast skeletal troponin activator being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, VITALITY-ALS, in people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
( ALS ).    In addition, the 2016 Amendment expands the Company s collaboration with Astellas to include the development of
CK-2127107 ( CK-107 ), a next-generation fast skeletal troponin activator, for the potential treatment of ALS, as well the possible development in ALS of other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014
Astellas Agreement ( ALS License ). Finally, the 2016 Amendment extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at
Cytokinetics.    The 2016 Amendment was subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and became effective on
the date of such clearance, on September 26, 2016 (the  Amendment Effective Date ).     Option on Tirasemtiv   
 In connection with the execution of the 2016 Amendment, the Company received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the
option on tirasemtiv in October 2016. Prior to Astellas  exercise of the option, the Company will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including the VITALITY-ALS trial, at its own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and
certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, the Company will grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv outside
the Company s own commercialization territory of North America, Europe and other select countries ( License on Tirasemtiv ) under a Tirasemtiv License and Collaboration Agreement ( Tirasemtiv License Agreement ). Each party
would be primarily responsible for the further development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.  
 If Astellas exercises its option for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv, the Company will receive
an option exercise payment ranging from $25.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of data from the VITALITY-ALS trial) to $80.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of FDA approval). In addition, the Company is eligible to receive
a potential milestone payment from Astellas associated with the Company s initiation of the VIGOR-ALS open-label extension trial for tirasemtiv. Such milestone would be $30 million, provided, however, that the amount will be reduced to $15.0
million if (i) Astellas elects to pay such milestone payment at the time the trial commences (if prior to Astellas  exercise of its option on tirasemtiv) or (ii) Astellas has exercised said option as of the time the trial commences. The Company
will be responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv during the option period, but if Astellas exercises the option after the defined review period following receipt of data from VITALITY-ALS, Astellas will at the time of option exercise
reimburse the Company for a share of any additional costs incurred after such review period.    If Astellas exercises the option for
tirasemtiv, the parties will share the future development costs of tirasemtiv in North America, Europe and certain other countries (with Cytokinetics bearing 75% of such shared costs and Astellas bearing 25% of such costs), and Astellas will be
solely responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv specific to its commercialization territory. Contingent upon the successful development of tirasemtiv, the Company may receive milestone payments up to $100.0 million for the initial
indication and up to $50.0 million for each subsequent indication. If tirasemtiv is commercialized, Astellas will pay the Company royalties (at rates ranging from the mid-teens to twenty percent) on sales of tirasemtiv in Astellas  territory,
and the Company will pay Astellas royalties (at rates up to the mid-teens) on sales of tirasemtiv in the Company s territory, in each case subject to various possible adjustments.

  The Company concluded that the option to obtain the License on Tirasemtiv is a substantive
option, and is therefore not considered a deliverable at the execution of the 2016 Amendment. The Company determined that the Tirasemtiv License Agreement is contingent upon the exercise of the Option on Tirasemtiv, and is therefore not effective
during the periods presented, since the option has not been exercised as of the latest balance sheet date. In addition, the Company did evaluate the consideration set to be received for the License on Tirasemtiv in relation to the fair value of the
License on Tirasemtiv, and determined that it was not being provided at a significant incremental discount.    The Company further
determined that the Option Fee of $15.0 million was deemed to be a prepayment towards the License on Tirasemtiv, and therefore deferred revenue recognition either until the option is exercised, or until the option expires unexercised. If the option
on tirasemtiv expires unexercised, the $15.0 million receipt would be added to the 2016 Amendment consideration, to be allocated to the units of accounting. The Option on Tirasemtiv expires, if not exercised by Astellas, following the receipt of the
approval letter for tirasemtiv from the FDA.    Prior to Astellas  exercise of the option, the Company will continue the development of
tirasemtiv, including the VITALITY-ALS trial, at its own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions, and the Company has complete discretion to continue to conduct clinical trials, and will retain the
final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. Therefore, the Company concluded that there was no obligation related to any development services during the option period.  
  Addition of ALS as an Added Indication (CK-107and other fast skeletal activators)   
 In connection with the execution of the 2016 Amendment, the Company received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35 million. In
addition, the Company received the accelerated payment of a $15 million milestone for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such
milestone has been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Amendment. The parties will share equally the costs of developing CK-107 in ALS for potential registration and marketing authorization in the U.S. and Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has
agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of CK-107 in ALS subject to a right to recoup the Company s share of such costs plus a 100% premium by reducing future milestone and royalty payments to the Company and (ii) the Company may defer
(but not eliminate) a portion of its co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18 months, subject to certain conditions. The Company has the right to co-fund its share of such Phase 2 development costs on a current
basis, in which case there would not be a premium due to Astellas. Cytokinetics will also receive approximately $44.2 million in additional sponsored research and development funding through 2018 which includes Astellas  funding of
Cytokinetics  conduct of the Phase 2 clinical development of CK-2127107 in ALS (approximately $39.1 million) as well as the continuing research collaboration (approximately $5.1 million).  
 Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, the Company and Astellas will collaborate to develop CK-107 in ALS. Astellas will be primarily responsible for
the development of CK-107 in ALS including the Phase 3 clinical trial efforts in ALS, but the Company will conduct the Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-107 in ALS. Subject to specified guiding principles, decision making will be by consensus, subject to
escalation and, if necessary, Astellas  final decision making authority on the development (including regulatory affairs), manufacturing, medical affairs and commercialization of CK-107 and other fast skeletal regulatory activators in ALS.  
 The Company determined that the deliverables under the 2016 Amendment included (1) the ALS License, (2) CK-107 development services in ALS
through Phase 2 activities ( ALS Development Services ), and (3) research services added ( Additional Research Services ). Deliverables that do not provide standalone value have been combined with other deliverables to form a
unit of accounting that collectively has standalone value, with revenue being recognized on the combined unit of accounting, rather than the individual deliverables. There are no rights of return provisions for the delivered items in the Current
Astellas Agreements.    The Company considered the 2016 Amendment to be a modification of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. The remaining
deliverables under the 2014 Astellas Agreement are: (1) the SMA license; (2) Research Services in connection with the Research Plan (through 2016); and (3) SMA Development Services in connection with the Development Plan. The Company evaluated the
components and consideration of the 2016 Amendment against other Phase 2 collaboration arrangements, and determined that the new 2016 deliverables had standalone value and are delivered at fair value. Therefore no reallocation of consideration to
the 2014 deliverables was performed.    The Company concluded that there are two units of accounting; the ALS License, and the Additional
Research Services and ALS Development Services ( Research and ALS Development Services ). The Company also determined that the ALS License has standalone value since (1) Astellas received a worldwide license for ALS, to perform further
research in the field of ALS, to develop and use CK-107 to make, have make, sell or otherwise commercialize CK-107 in ALS; (2) Astellas has the right to sublicense the rights to CK-107 in ALS to a third party; and (3) Astellas has the technical
capabilities to advance further development on CK-107 in ALS, without the continued involvement of the Company.

The Company allocated the $50.0 million in upfront consideration along with the $44.2 million in committed
research and development consideration, among the two units of accounting, on a relative fair value basis, using the best estimated selling price ( BESP ). The BESP of the ALS License was determined using a discounted cash flow, risk
adjusted for probability of success; while the BESP of the research and development services were determined using estimated research and development cost, included in the research and development programs approved by Astellas. Based on this
allocation of consideration, the Company stands to recognize $74.9 million in license revenue and $19.3 in research and development revenue, under the 2016 Amendment. Since the upfront consideration of $50 million is less than the
allocated consideration of the ALS License, the Company will recognize $50 million in license revenue on the Amendment Effective Date, in September 2016, and record the remaining $24.9 million as an allocation from research and development
services, when those services are performed.    Allocation of arrangement consideration, and revenue recognition (in millions):  
   
   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $50.0 million in license
revenue under the 2016 Amendment.    The Company will recognize the research and development services using the proportional performance
model over the initial development term, through the completion of the ALS Development Services. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, the Company receives payment for research and development revenue from Astellas for reimbursements of internal costs of
certain full-time employee equivalents, supporting collaborative research and development programs, and of other costs related to those programs.  
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no research and development revenue from Astellas, under the
2016 Amendment.    The Company believes that each of the milestones related to research under the Current Astellas Agreement is substantive
and can only be achieved with the Company s past and current performance and each milestone will result in additional payments to the Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $2.0
million in milestone revenue for research under this agreement, related to the initiation of IND-enabling studies for a fast skeletal muscle activator. The Company is eligible to receive up to $2.0 million in research milestone payments under
the collaboration for each future potential drug candidate.  
      Page 16  

Table of Contents  

  The achievement of each of the late stage development milestones and the commercialization
milestones are dependent solely upon the results of Astellas  development activities and therefore these milestones were not deemed to be substantive.  
 Under the Current Astellas Agreement, additional research and early and late state development milestone payments which are based on various
research and clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission for approval of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the commercial launch of collaboration products
could total over $600.0 million, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million related to CK-2127107 in each of SMA, ALS and other neuromuscular indications. Additionally,
$200.0 million in commercial milestones could be received under the 2014 Astellas Agreement provided certain sales targets are met. Due to the nature of drug development, including the inherent risk of development and approval of drug
candidates by regulatory authorities, it is not possible to estimate if and when these milestone payments could become due.    In the event
Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, the Company will receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing CK-2127107.
Cytokinetics also holds an option to co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. Under
the Current Astellas Agreement, Cytokinetics retains an option to co-promote collaboration products containing fast skeletal muscle activators for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in addition to its option to co-promote
other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada as provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement. Astellas will reimburse Cytokinetics for certain expenses associated with its co-promotion activities.

    Note 6   Fair Value Measurements   
 The Company follows the fair value accounting guidance to value its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that
would be received for assets when sold or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that the Company believes market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.  
 The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best information
reasonably available. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, and considers the security issuers  and the third-party
insurers  credit risk in its assessment of fair value.    The Company classifies the determined fair value based on the observability
of those inputs. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three defined levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  
 Level 1   Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
 Level 2   Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or through corroboration with
observable market data; and    Level 3   Unobservable inputs, for which there is little or no market data for the assets or
liabilities, such as internally-developed valuation models.

  Financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 are classified in the table below in one of the three categories described above (in thousands):      
   The valuation technique used to measure fair value for the Company s Level 1 assets is a market approach,
using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical assets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant Level 2 or Level 3 inputs. The carrying amount of the Company s accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.  
  Long Term Debt:     As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the long-term debt, payable in installments through year ended 2020, approximated its carrying value of $29.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively, because it is carried at a
market observable interest rate, which are considered Level 2.

   In October 2015, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with
Oxford Finance LLC ( Oxford ) as the collateral agent and a lender, and Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ) as a lender (Oxford and SVB collectively the  Lenders ) to fund its working capital and other general corporate needs.
The Loan Agreement provided for (1) term loans of up to $40.0 million in aggregate, (2) warrants to purchase 65,189 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $6.90 per share under the first term loan, and
(3) additional warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock to be based on the amount of the additional term loans and a price per share determined on the day of funding in accordance with the Grant Agreement, which is
also the exercise price per share for the warrants.    The Company drew down $15.0 million in funds under the Loan Agreement in October
2015 at the time of the first draw down, and at that time, could at its sole discretion draw down an additional $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement in two term loans, provided certain specified conditions stipulated in the Loan Agreement are met
preceding those draws. During February 2016, the Company drew down an additional $15.0 million in funds under the Loan Agreement and issued warrants to purchase 68,285 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $6.59 per share
under the second term loan. As of September 30, 2016, there were 133,474 warrants outstanding and exercisable. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has received $29.8 million from this loan and security agreement, net of issuance cost. The
Company can at its sole discretion draw down an additional $10.0 million under the Loan Agreement from the Lenders, at any time prior to March 31, 2017, subject to the Company s satisfaction of specified conditions precedent related to the
earlier of (i) the occurrence of an equity event as described in the Loan Agreement, or (ii) specified results from the Company s VITALITY-ALS Phase 3 trial of tirasemtiv, each as specified in the Loan Agreement.  
 The Company is required to repay the outstanding principal in 36 equal installments beginning October 2017 and is due in full in October 2020.
The first and second term loans bear interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum, respectively. The remaining term loans, if drawn, will bear interest at a rate fixed at the time of draw, equal to the greater of (i) 7.50% and (ii) the sum of
the three month U.S. LIBOR rate plus 7.31%. The Company is required to make a final payment fee of 4.00% of the amounts of the Term Loans drawn payable on the earlier of (i) the prepayment of the Term Loans or (ii) the Maturity Date. The
loan carries prepayment penalties of 3% and 2% for prepayment within one and two years, respectively, of the loan origination and 1% thereafter. The warrants issued in the Loan Agreement became exercisable upon issuance and will remain exercisable
for five years from issuance or the closing of a merger consolidation transaction in which the Company is not the surviving entity.

  In accordance with the accounting guidance, the Company allocated a portion of the gross proceeds
from each draw down under the Loan Agreement to the underlying warrants, using the relative fair value method. This resulted in the allocation of $0.6 million of the draw down proceeds to the warrants, which was accounted for as debt discount. Debt
discount is being amortized over the term of the debt, and recorded in interest expense in the statement of operations. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model.  
 The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the
Company and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on dispositions, changes in business, management, ownership or business locations, mergers or acquisitions, indebtedness, encumbrances, distributions, investments,
transactions with affiliates and subordinated debt. The Agreement also includes customary events of default, including but not limited to the nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, material adverse changes, attachment, levy,
restraint on business, cross-defaults on material indebtedness, bankruptcy, material judgments, misrepresentations, subordinated debt, governmental approvals, lien priority and delisting. Upon an event of default, the Lenders may, among other
things, accelerate the loans and foreclose on the collateral. The Company s obligations under the Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s current and future assets, other than its intellectual property.  
 The Company recorded interest expense related to the long term debt of $0.7 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Included in interest expense for this period was interest on principal, amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, and the accretion of the final payment fee. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the effective interest rate on the amounts borrowed under the Agreement, including the amortization of the debt discount and issuance cost, and the accretion of the final payment, was 9.3%. No interest expense was recorded
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.    Future minimum payments under the Loan, as of September 30, 2016 are
as follows (in thousands):      
    Note 9   Stockholders  Equity   
   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss    
 Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of unrealized
holding gains and losses on the Company s available-for-sale securities that are excluded from net loss and reported separately in stockholders  equity.  
 In the first three and nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded insignificant amounts of unrealized gains (losses) in
available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and did not reclassify any unrealized gains on investments from accumulated other comprehensive income into net loss.  
   Warrants      As of September 30,
2016, the Company had warrants outstanding to purchase 4.3 million shares of the Company s common stock.    In June 2012, warrants
were issued pursuant to the June 2012 underwriting agreements the Company entered into in connection with two separate, concurrent offerings for our securities (the  June 2012 Public Offerings ). In accordance with the accounting guidance
for valuing stock and warrants when stock is issued in conjunction with other securities, and the stock and other securities are to be accounted for as equity, the Company allocated the gross purchase proceeds using the relative fair value method.
For accounting purposes, the June 2012 Public Offerings were considered to be one transaction. The fair value of the common stock issued in the June 2012 Public Offerings was calculated based on the closing price of the stock on the commitment date
as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Market.

  In October 2015, warrants to purchase 65,189 shares of the Company s common stock at an
exercise price of $6.90 per share were issued in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Refer to Note 8  Long-Term Debt , for further details regarding the Loan Agreement.  
 In February 2016, warrants to purchase 68,285 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $6.59 per share were issued in
accordance with the Loan Agreement. The Company valued the warrants as of the date of issuance at $288,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: a contractual term of five years, a risk-free interest rate of
1.7%, volatility of 75%, and the fair value of the Company s common stock of $7.00.    In August 2016, warrants to purchase 104,533
shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $5.28 per share were cash exercised in accordance with the June 2012 public offerings underwriting agreements.  
 In September 2016, the Company issued 690,580 shares of common stock related to cashless exercises of warrants in accordance with the June
2012 public offerings.    Outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:  
   
     Committed Equity Offering    
 On September 4, 2015, the Company entered into an Committed Equity Offering (an  CE Offering ) that is an at-the-market issuance
sales agreement (the  Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement ) with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. ( Cantor Fitzgerald ), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to
$40.0 million, from time to time through Cantor Fitzgerald as its sales agent. The issuance and sale of these shares by the Company under the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement, if any, are subject to the continued effectiveness of its registration
statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2015 (File No. 333-206795).    Sales of the
Company s common stock through Cantor Fitzgerald, if any, will be made on The NASDAQ Global Market by means of ordinary brokers  transactions at market prices or as otherwise agreed to by the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Company s common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or
other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). The Company is not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement. The offering of shares of common stock pursuant to the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement will
terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all common stock subject to the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement or (2) termination of the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement. The Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement may be terminated by Cantor Fitzgerald at any
time upon ten days notice to the Company or may be terminated by the Company at any time upon five days notice to Cantor Fitzgerald, or by Cantor Fitzgerald at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse change
in the Company s business. The Company will pay Cantor Fitzgerald a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share of any common stock sold through Cantor Fitzgerald under the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement. The
Company has also provided Cantor Fitzgerald with customary indemnification and contribution rights. Through December 31, 2015, 808,193 shares have been issued through Cantor Fitzgerald under the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement for total net proceeds of
approximately $8.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no additional shares have been issued under the Cantor Fitzgerald Agreement.  
   Equity Incentive Plan      Total
employee stock-based compensation expenses were $1.9 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $5.3 million and $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,

   Note 11   Commitments and Contingencies   
   Commitments      The Company leases
office space and equipment under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires in 2018, with an option to extend the lease for an additional three-year period. The lease terms provide for rental payments on a graduated scale and the Company s
payment of certain operating expenses. During March 2016, the Company amended the lease agreement to include certain additional operating expenses, related to the replacement of two boilers. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease period. Rent expense was $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $2.6 and $2.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.      Contingencies      In the
ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the
Company s breach of such agreements, services to be provided by or on behalf of the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its
directors and certain of its officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. The Company
maintains director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its directors and certain of its officers and employees, and former officers and directors in certain circumstances. The Company
maintains product liability insurance and comprehensive general liability insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under
these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular indemnification obligation. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to
maximum loss clauses. Management is not currently aware of any matters that could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  
 In December 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and negligence on the part of a contract
research organization for the BENEFIT-ALS clinical trial. The Company was seeking monetary damages. On June 7, 2016 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the contract research organization for $4.5 million. The Company received
payment related to the settlement agreement in July 2016 and the full settlement amount was classified as a reduction of R D expense in June 2016.  
  Note 12   Income Taxes     During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record a provision for income taxes because it expected to generate a net operating loss for the year ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 The Company defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as
 more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit
that, in the Company s judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized.    The significant jurisdictions in which the Company files
income tax returns are the United States and the state of California. For jurisdictions in which tax filings are made, the Company is subject to income tax examination for all fiscal years since inception. The IRS s Large Business and
International Division concluded its audit of the 2009 tax year with no material adjustments. However, in general, the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and
credits carried forward from those years. The Company believes that it maintains adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions.    In
general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ( Section 382 ), a corporation that undergoes an  ownership change  is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses
( NOLs ) and tax credits to offset future taxable income. The Company has performed a Section 382 analysis as of September 30, 2016 and does not believe that it has experienced an ownership change since 2006. A portion of
the Company s existing NOLs and tax credits are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in the Company s stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change
under Section 382 and result in additional limitations.

   Restatement of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    
 On December 9, 2016, our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after discussion with management and the Company s
independent registered public accountants determined that there was an error in the accounting of the recognition of clinical trial research and development expenses and related balance sheet accounts. The following is a summary of the restatement
changes made to the financial statements previously filed as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    Condensed

   We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 as Cytokinetics, Incorporated. We are a late-stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class muscle activators as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and or declining. Our research and development
activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. Our most advanced research and
development programs relate to the biology of muscle function and are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of skeletal or cardiac muscle. We are also conducting earlier-stage research directed to other compounds with the
potential to modulate muscle contractility and other muscle functions, such as growth, energetics and metabolism.    Our drug candidates
currently in clinical development are our skeletal muscle activators tirasemtiv and CK-2127107, and our cardiac muscle activator omecamtiv mecarbil. Tirasemtiv is being evaluated for the potential treatment of ALS. CK-2127107 is being evaluated for
the potential treatment of spinal muscle atrophy ( SMA ) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and for potential use in other indications associated with muscle weakness (including ALS) under a strategic alliance
with Astellas established in June 2013 and expanded in December 2014 and July 2016. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being evaluated for the potential treatment of heart failure under a strategic alliance with Amgen established in 2006.  
  Muscle Contractility Programs   
   Skeletal Muscle Contractility Program    
 Tirasemtiv is our lead drug candidate from this program. We retain exclusive rights to tirasemtiv, subject to Astellas  exercise of its
option for a license to tirasemtiv (see   Astellas  Option on Tirasemtiv   below). We conducted a Phase 2 clinical development program for tirasemtiv, and we started a Phase 3 clinical development program for this drug candidate
in patients with ALS in July 2015. In collaboration with Astellas, we are also developing another drug candidate from this program, CK-2127107, for potential indications associated with muscle weakness. We started a Phase 2 clinical trial for
CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in December 2015. Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in June 2016. Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 are
structurally distinct and selective small molecules that activate the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex in the sarcomere by increasing its sensitivity to calcium, leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility. Each of tirasemtiv and
CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models and evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects in humans. We are evaluating other potential indications for which tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 may be
useful.      Tirasemtiv.    
 Tirasemtiv (formerly known as CK-2017357), is a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator. Cytokinetics is developing this drug candidate for the
potential treatment of ALS, and in July 2016, we entered into an agreement with Astellas (the  2016 Amendment ) to expand our collaboration on research, development and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators under the Amended and
Restated License and Collaboration Agreement with Astellas (the  2014 Astellas Agreement ). The 2016 Amendment was subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and became effective on September 26, 2016, the
date of such clearance. Under the 2016 Amendment, we granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas
will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights outside of our commercialization territory in North America, Europe and other select countries.  
 We conducted a Phase 2 clinical trials program for tirasemtiv, including a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with ALS, known as BENEFIT-ALS
(Blinded Evaluation of Neuromuscular Effects and Functional Improvement with Tirasemtiv in ALS). Based on the results of BENEFIT-ALS, we started VITALITY-ALS (Ventilatory Investigation of Tirasemtiv and Assessment of Longitudinal Indices after
Treatment for a Year in ALS) in July 2015. Tirasemtiv has been granted orphan drug designation and fast track status by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency, in each case for the potential treatment of
ALS.

  VITALITY-ALS is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was
originally designed to enroll 445 patients with possible, probable or definite ALS diagnosed within 24 months, and with a baseline vital capacity   70 % of predicted, based on age, sex, and height. Patients may be enrolled whether or not
they are on riluzole therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial will assess change from baseline in SVC, to be assessed after 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment. Secondary endpoints include time to decline from baseline in
percent predicted SVC by     20 percentage points or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death; time to decline from baseline in percent predicted SVC to     50 percent predicted or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or
death; time to first occurrence of any use of assisted ventilation or death; time to decline in any of the three respiratory domains of the ALSFRS-R or death; and change in the Mega-Score of muscle strength.  
 Patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS will receive two-weeks of open-label treatment with tirasemtiv administered at 250 mg/day and will then be
randomized to double-blind treatment with placebo or one of three target tirasemtiv dose levels (250 mg/day, 375 mg/day, 500 mg/day) in a 3:2:2:2 ratio for a total of 48 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment. Then in a
four-week double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase, patients on tirasemtiv will be randomized either to continue the double-blind tirasemtiv dose they were receiving or to be withdrawn to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients who had been receiving
placebo during the 48 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment will continue to receive placebo.    In January 2016, we amended
the protocol of VITALITY-ALS to provide for an increase in the number of patients to be enrolled in the clinical trial from approximately 445 patients to approximately 600 patients. Increasing the number of patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS will
increase the statistical power to detect a difference in the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in SVC at 24 weeks) between  tirasemtiv  and placebo.  
 In August 2016, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in VITALITY-ALS, enrolling over 700 patients in 81 centers in eleven
countries. We convened the second Data Monitoring Committee Meeting for VITALITY-ALS to review unblinded safety and efficacy data; and the Committee recommended continuing the trial without modifications to the protocol.  
 In March 2016, we announced a research collaboration with Origent Data Sciences, Inc. ( Origent ) to refine and prospectively
validate an Origent computer model to predict the course of ALS disease progression leveraging data from Cytokinetics  clinical trials of  tirasemtiv . Funded by Origent s receipt of a grant from The ALS Association, this joint
research program will enable the first prospective validation of the predictive model in a clinical trial setting. Previously, the Origent models predicting both function and survival of ALS patients have been validated using their internal and
retrospective external datasets.    In the second quarter of 2016, the manuscript,  A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
phase IIb trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tirasemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  was published in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration journal.  
  Astellas  Option on Tirasemtiv   
 In connection with the execution of the 2016 Amendment, we received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the option on
tirasemtiv, in October 2016. Prior to Astellas  exercise of the option, we will continue to conduct the Phase 3 development program of tirasemtiv, including the Phase 3 clinical trial for tirasemtiv in patients with ALS known as VITALITY-ALS
(Ventilatory Investigation of Tirasemtiv and Assessment of Longitudinal Indices after Treatment for a Year in ALS), at our own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions, and we will retain the final
decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, we will grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv ( License on Tirasemtiv ) outside our commercialization
territory of North America, Europe and other select countries ( Cytokinetics  Territory ) under a Tirasemtiv License and Collaboration Agreement ( Tirasemtiv License Agreement ). Each party would be primarily responsible for
the further development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.    If
Astellas exercises its option for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv, we will receive an option exercise payment ranging from $25.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of data from the
VITALITY-ALS trial) to $80.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of FDA approval). In addition, we are eligible to receive a potential milestone payment from Astellas associated with our initiation of the VIGOR-ALS open-label extension
trial for tirasemtiv. Such milestone would be $30.0 million; provided, however, that the amount will be reduced to $15 million if (i) Astellas elects to pay such milestone payment at the time the trial commences (if prior to Astellas 
exercise of its option on tirasemtiv) or (ii) Astellas has exercised said option as of the time the trial commences. We will be responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv during the option period, but if Astellas  exercises the
option after the defined review period following receipt of data from VITALITY-ALS, Astellas will at the time of option exercise reimburse us for a share of any additional costs incurred after such review period.

  If Astellas exercises the option for tirasemtiv, the parties will share the future development
costs of tirasemtiv in North America, Europe and certain other countries (with Cytokinetics bearing 75% of such shared costs and Astellas bearing 25% of such costs) and Astellas will be solely responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv
specific to its commercialization territory. Contingent upon the successful development of tirasemtiv, we may receive milestone payments up to $100.0 million for the initial indication and up to $50.0 million for each subsequent indication. If
tirasemtiv is commercialized, Astellas will pay us royalties (at rates ranging from the mid-teens to twenty percent) on sales of tirasemtiv in Astellas  Territory, and we will pay Astellas royalties (at rates up to the mid-teens) on sales of
tirasemtiv in the Cytokinetics Territory, in each case subject to various possible adjustments.    The Company concluded that the option to
obtain the License on Tirasemtiv is a substantive option, and is therefore not considered a deliverable at the execution of the 2016 agreement. The Company determined that the Tirasemtiv License Agreement is contingent upon the exercise of the
Option on Tirasemtiv, and is therefore not effective during the periods presented, since the option has not been exercised as of the latest balance sheet date. In addition, the Company did evaluate the consideration set to be received for the
License on Tirasemtiv in relation to the fair value of the License on Tirasemtiv, and determined that it was not being provided at a significant incremental discount.  
 The Company further determined that the Option Fee of $15 million was deemed to be a prepayment towards the License on Tirasemtiv, and
therefore deferred revenue recognition either until the option is exercised, or until the option expires unexercised, at which point the $15 million receipt would be added to the 2016 Amendment consideration, to be allocated to the units of
accounting. The Option on Tirasemtiv expires following the receipt of the approval letter from tirasemtiv from the FDA.    Refer to Note 4,
 Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting, and the
revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Amendment.    The clinical trials program for
tirasemtiv may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the
drug is commercialized. Tirasemtiv is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. Our expenditures are expected to increase as we continue to progress tirasemtiv towards potential registration.  
   CK-2127107 and Other Skeletal Muscle Activators    
  Astellas Strategic Alliance . CK-2127107 is being developed jointly by Cytokinetics and Astellas.  
 On July 27, 2016, the Company and Astellas entered into the 2016 Amendment to expand their collaboration on the research, development and
commercialization of skeletal muscle activators under the 2014 Astellas Agreement (as amended, the  Current Astellas Agreement ) including an expansion of the collaboration with Astellas to include the development of CK-2127107
( CK-107 ), a next-generation fast skeletal troponin activator, for the potential treatment of ALS, as well as the possible development in ALS of other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014 Astellas
Agreement. The 2016 Amendment also extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics. Finally, under the 2016
Amendment, the Company granted Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv ( Option on Tirasemtiv ), as discussed above.  
 The 2016 Amendment was subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and became effective on the date of such
clearance, on September 26, 2016 (the  Amendment Effective Date ).     Addition of ALS as an Added Indication (CK-107and other
fast skeletal activators)     In connection with the execution of the 2016 Amendment, the Company received a non-refundable upfront
amendment fee of $35 million. In addition, the Company received the accelerated payment of a $15 million milestone for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provided for in the
2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone has been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Amendment. The parties will share equally the costs of developing CK-107 in ALS for potential registration and marketing authorization in the U.S. and
Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of CK-107 in ALS subject to a right to recoup the Company s share of such costs plus a 100% premium by reducing future milestone and royalty payments to the
Company and (ii) the Company may defer (but not eliminate) a portion of its co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18 months, subject to certain conditions. The Company has the right to co-fund its share of such
Phase 2 development costs on a current basis, in which case there would not be a premium due to Astellas. Cytokinetics will also receive approximately $44.2 million in additional sponsored research and development funding through 2018 which includes
Astellas  funding of Cytokinetics  conduct of the Phase 2 clinical development of CK-2127107 in ALS (approximately $39.1 million) as well as the continuing research collaboration (approximately $5.1 million).

Table of Contents  

  Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, the Company and Astellas will collaborate to develop CK-107 in
ALS. Astellas will be primarily responsible for the development of CK-107 in ALS, but the Company will conduct the Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-107 in ALS and will share in the operational responsibility for later clinical trials. Subject to
specified guiding principles, decision making will be by consensus, subject to escalation and, if necessary, Astellas  final decision making authority on the development (including regulatory affairs), manufacturing, medical affairs and
commercialization of CK-107 and other fast skeletal regulatory activators in ALS.    The Company determined that the deliverables under the
Amendment included (1) the ALS License, (2) ALS Development Services through 2018, and (3) Research Services through 2017. Deliverables that do not provide standalone value have been combined with other deliverables to form a unit of accounting that
collectively has standalone value, with revenue being recognized on the combined unit of accounting, rather than the individual deliverables. There are no rights of return provisions for the delivered items in the Astellas agreements.  
 The Company considered the 2016 Amendment to be a modification of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. The remaining deliverables under the 2014
Astellas Agreement are: (1) the SMA license; (2) Research Services in connection with the Research Plan (through 2016); and (3) SMA Development Services in connection with the Development Plan. The Company evaluated the components and consideration
of the 2016 Amendment against other Phase 2 collaboration out license arrangements, and determined that the new 2016 deliverables had standalone value and are delivered at fair value. Therefore no reallocation of consideration to the 2014
deliverables was required.    The Company concluded that there are two units of accounting; the ALS License and the Research and Development
services. The Company also determined that the ALS License has standalone value since (1) Astellas received a worldwide license for ALS, to perform further research in the field of ALS, to develop and use CK-107 to make, have make, sell or otherwise
commercialize CK-107 in ALS; (2) Astellas has the right to sublicense the rights to CK-107 in ALS to a third party; and (3) Astellas has the technical capabilities to advance further development on CK-107 in ALS, without the continued involvement of
the Company.    Refer to Note 4,  Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting, and the revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Amendment.
   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $50.0 million in license revenue under the 2016
Amendment.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no research and development revenue from
Astellas, under the 2016 Amendment.     2014 Astellas Agreement   
 In December 2014, we entered into the 2014 Astellas Agreement. This agreement superseded the License and Collaboration Agreement between
Cytokinetics and Astellas of June 2013 (the  Original Astellas Agreement ). The 2014 Astellas Agreement expanded the objective of the collaboration of advancing novel therapies for diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle
weakness to include SMA and potentially other neuromuscular indications for CK-2127107 and other fast skeletal troponin activators, in addition to the non-neuromuscular indications provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement.  
 Under the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we expanded the exclusive license previously granted Astellas under the Original Astellas Agreement to
co-develop and commercialize CK-2127107 for potential application in non-neuromuscular indications worldwide to include certain neuromuscular indications as well. Concurrent with the expanded collaboration, the companies agreed to advance CK-2127107
into Phase 2 clinical development. Cytokinetics started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in December 2015. The development program may include other neuromuscular indications as the companies may agree. Cytokinetics and
Astellas will jointly develop and may jointly commercialize CK-2127107 and other fast skeletal troponin activators in neuromuscular indications. Astellas will be responsible for the costs associated with the development of all collaboration
products, including CK-2127107, subject to Cytokinetics  option to co-fund certain development costs as described below.    Under the
2014 Astellas Agreement, the companies extended through 2016 their joint research program to identify next- generation skeletal muscle activators to be nominated as potential drug candidates. This research will be conducted at Astellas 
expense.    Refer to Note 4,  Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the revenue recognition of research and early development milestone, under the Current Agreement.

  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $2.0 million
in milestone revenue for research under this agreement, related to the initiation of IND-enabling studies for a fast skeletal muscle activator. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded no milestone revenue
for research under this agreement. The Company is eligible to receive up to $2.0 million in research milestone payments under the collaboration for each future potential drug candidate. Cytokinetics retains an option to conduct early-stage
development for certain agreed indications at its initial expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration. Under the 2014 Astellas Agreement, Cytokinetics also retains an option to co-promote collaboration products
containing fast skeletal muscle activators for neuromuscular indications in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in addition to its option to co-promote other collaboration products in the U.S. and Canada as provided for in the Original Astellas Agreement.
Astellas will reimburse Cytokinetics for certain expenses associated with its co-promotion activities. Under the 2014 Astellas Agreement, Astellas has exclusive rights to co-develop and commercialize CK-2127107 and other fast skeletal troponin
activators in SMA and potentially other indications and other novel mechanism skeletal muscle activators in all indications, subject to certain Cytokinetics  development and commercialization rights. Cytokinetics may co-promote and conduct
certain commercial activities in the U.S., Canada and Europe under agreed scenarios.    Cytokinetics received an upfront payment of $30.0
million in connection with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Also, in conjunction with the execution of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement which provided for the sale of 2,040,816 shares
of our common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90 and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million, which was received in December 2014. Pursuant to this agreement, Astellas agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect
to our common stock. Concurrently, Cytokinetics earned a $15.0 million milestone payment relating to Astellas  decision to advance CK-2127107 into Phase 2 clinical development. Cytokinetics is also eligible to potentially receive over $20.0
million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the three years of the collaboration following through 2017.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $3.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively, in license
revenue based on the proportional performance model under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $9.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively, in license revenue based on the
proportional performance model under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, $11.1 million license revenue remains deferred under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to the 2014 Astellas Agreement, the Company recognized
research and development revenue from Astellas for reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents, supporting collaborative research and development programs, and of other costs related to those programs. The Company is
eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the three years of the collaboration through 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recorded research and development revenue from Astellas of $3.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded research and
development revenue from Astellas of $9.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, under the 2014 Astellas Agreement.    Under the Current
Astellas Agreement, based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, Cytokinetics may receive over $600.0 million in milestone payments relating to the development and commercial launch of collaboration products, including up to $95.0 million
relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million in development and commercial launch milestones for CK-2127107 in each of SMA, ALS and other neuromuscular indications. Cytokinetics may also receive up to $200.0
million in payments for achievement of pre-specified sales milestones related to net sales of all collaboration products under the 2014 Astellas Agreement. If Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, Cytokinetics will also receive
royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing  CK-2127107.  Cytokinetics also holds an option to
co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty percent. In addition to the foregoing development,
commercial and sales milestones, Cytokinetics may also receive payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research program.  
 The clinical trials programs for CK-2127107 may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or
material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved, and the drug is commercialized. CK-2127107 is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when
this may occur. Our expenditures will increase if Astellas terminates development of CK-2127107 or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we conduct early-stage development for certain agreed indications at our initial
expense, subject to reimbursement if development continues under the collaboration.

   CK-2127107 Clinical Development   
  Phase 2 Clinical Development:  Cytokinetics, in partnership with Astellas, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in
patients with SMA in December 2015. The clinical trial is designed to assess effects of CK-2127107 on multiple measures of muscle function in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients with SMA, a severe, genetic neuromuscular disease that leads to
debilitating muscle wasting and progressive, often fatal, muscle weakness. The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to determine the potential pharmacodynamic effects of a suspension formulation of
CK-2127107 following multiple oral doses in patients with Type II, Type III, or Type IV SMA. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CK-2127107. The trial will enroll seventy-two patients in two
sequential, ascending dose cohorts (two cohorts of 36 patients each, stratified half ambulatory and half non- ambulatory).    The first
cohort of patients is receiving 150 mg of CK-2127107 dosed twice daily for eight weeks; the second cohort of patients will receive 450 mg of CK-2127107 dosed twice daily or a lower dose, depending on the data from the first cohort. At the conclusion
of the trial, approximately 24 patients will have been randomized to placebo, approximately 24 patients to 150 mg of CK-2127107 twice daily and approximately 24 patients to 450 mg of CK-2127107 twice daily (or a lower dose, pending the review of
data from the first cohort). In each of these three treatment groups of approximately 24 patients each, roughly half will be ambulatory and half will be non-ambulatory. Multiple assessments of skeletal muscle function and fatigability will be
performed including respiratory assessments, upper limb strength and functionality for non-ambulatory patients, as well as six-minute walk and timed-up-and-go for ambulatory patients.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, we continued enrollment of the Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with SMA, in collaboration
with Astellas. We expect to complete enrollment of cohort 1 of our Phase 2 trial of CK-2127107 in patients with SMA in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
 In June 2016, Astellas, in collaboration with Cytokinetics, started a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. Astellas is conducting this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled two period crossover clinical trial designed to assess the effect of CK-2127107 on physical function in patients with COPD. The trial is expected
to enroll approximately 40 patients in the United States and is designed to assess the effect of CK-2127107 compared to placebo on exercise tolerance. Additionally, the trial will assess the cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular effect of CK-2127107
relative to placebo and the effect of CK-2127107 on resting spirometry relative to placebo. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CK-2127107 also will be assessed. We expect Astellas to complete enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of
CK-2127107 in patients with COPD in 2017.      Ongoing Research in Skeletal Muscle Activators.    
 Our research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas. We are conducting translational research in preclinical models
of disease and muscle function with fast skeletal muscle troponin activators to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel mechanism in diseases or conditions associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction. We also intend to conduct
preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere. We are conducting a joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators.
Under the Current Astellas Agreement, the joint research program will continue in 2017 and Astellas will reimburse us for certain research activities. We advanced a next-generation skeletal muscle activator into IND-enabling studies in 2016 and
earned a $2.0 million milestone.      Cardiac Muscle Contractility Program    
 Our lead drug candidate from this program is omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator. We expect omecamtiv mecarbil to be
developed as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both for use in the hospital setting and for use in the outpatient setting. During the quarter, we participated with Amgen in regulatory meetings with the FDA, EMA and
Health Canada intended to inform the design of a Phase 3 development program for omecamtiv mecarbil. We also conducted various clinical, non-clinical, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC), and planning activities in collaboration with
Amgen to support the potential advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil into a Phase 3 development program. In September 2016, we announced Amgen s decision to advance omecamtiv mecarbil into Phase 3 clinical development with a cardiovascular outcomes
clinical trial expected to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are continuing our joint research with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in 2016.

    Amgen Strategic Alliance  . In December 2006, we entered into a collaboration
and option agreement with Amgen to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics, including omecamtiv mecarbil, that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure (the
 Amgen Agreement ). The agreement granted Amgen an option to obtain an exclusive license worldwide, except Japan, to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates arising from the collaboration. In May 2009, Amgen
exercised its option. As a result, Amgen became responsible for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds at its expense worldwide (excluding Japan), subject to our development and commercialization
participation rights. Amgen will reimburse us for certain research and development activities we perform under the collaboration.    In June
2013, Cytokinetics and Amgen executed an amendment to the Amgen Agreement to include Japan, resulting in a worldwide collaboration (the  Amgen Agreement Amendment ). Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we received a
non-refundable upfront license fee of $15.0 million in June 2013. Under the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we conducted a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study intended to support inclusion of Japan in a potential Phase 3 clinical development program and
potential global registration dossier for omecamtiv mecarbil. Amgen reimbursed us for the costs of this study. In addition, we are eligible to receive additional pre-commercialization milestone payments relating to the development of omecamtiv
mecarbil in Japan of up to $50.0 million, and royalties on sales of omecamtiv mecarbil in Japan. In conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement which provided for the sale of 1,404,100
shares of our common stock to Amgen at a price per share of $7.12 and an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million which was received in June 2013. Pursuant to this agreement, Amgen agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect to
our common stock.    Under the Amgen Agreement, as amended, the Company is eligible to receive over $350.0 million in development milestone
payments which are based on various clinical milestones, including the initiation of certain clinical studies, the submission of a drug candidate to certain regulatory authorities for marketing approval and the receipt of such approvals. These
clinical milestones include an approximately $27.0 million milestone relating to the start of GALACTIC-HF. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in commercial milestone payments provided certain sales targets are met. In
addition, we are eligible to receive royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement. The Amgen Agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co-funding Phase 3
development costs of omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates under the collaboration. If we elect to co-fund such costs, we would be entitled to co-promote the co-funded drug in North America and participate in agreed commercialization
activities in institutional care settings, at Amgen s expense.    In July 2013, Amgen announced that it had granted an option to
commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe to Servier, with Cytokinetics  consent, pursuant to an Option, License and Collaboration Agreement (the  Servier Agreement ). The option and related commercialization sublicense to Servier,
is subject to the terms and conditions of the Amgen Agreement.    In August 2016, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Amgen and Servier
(the  Letter Agreement ), which (i) expands the territory of the sublicense to Servier to include specified countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) and (ii) provides that, if Amgen s rights under the
Amgen Agreement, as amended, are terminated with respect to the territory of such sublicense, the sublicensed rights previously granted by Amgen to Servier under the Servier Agreement will remain in effect and become a direct license or sublicense
of such rights by us to Servier, on substantially the same terms as set forth in the Servier Agreement, including but not limited to Servier s payment of its share of agreed development costs and future milestone and royalty payments to us. The
Letter Agreement does not otherwise modify our rights and obligations under the Amgen Agreement, as amended, or create any additional financial obligations of Cytokinetics, unless we otherwise agrees in writing. Amgen remains responsible for the
performance of its obligations under the Amgen Agreement, as amended, relating to Europe and the CIS, including the payment of milestones and royalties relating to the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the CIS.
   In September 2016, Amgen and Servier announced Servier s decision to exercise its option to commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in
Europe as well as the CIS, including Russia.    We recorded reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities in connection
with our strategic alliance with Amgen of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively in the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015. See
Note 4,  Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policy under our agreement with Amgen.

    Omecamtiv Mecarbil Clinical Development    
 Omecamtiv mecarbil has been the subject of an extensive Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials program. In November 2015, we announced the results
of COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in Heart Failure), the last Phase 2 trial of omecamtiv mecarbil completed prior to the decision to advance this drug candidate to Phase 3 clinical development. COSMIC-HF
was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil dosed orally in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and its effects on echocardiographic measures of cardiac function. An
intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil was studied in a Phase 2b clinical trial known as ATOMIC-AHF (Acute Treatment with Omecamtiv Mecarbil to Increase Contractility in Acute Heart Failure), which was designed to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are hospitalized with acute heart failure.  
  Phase 2 Clinical Development Program    
  COSMIC-HF . COSMIC-HF was a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial designed to assess
the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of omecamtiv mecarbil dosed orally in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction as well as its effects on echocardiographic measures of cardiac function. COSMIC-HF was
conducted by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics. The trial began with two dose escalation cohorts of 40 patients each, randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo or one of three different modified release oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil for seven
days. The dose of omecamtiv mecarbil in the first of these two dose escalation cohorts was 25 mg twice daily; in the second, it was 50 mg twice daily. The purpose of the dose escalation cohorts was to select one of the three modified release oral
formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil for further evaluation in a larger group of patients treated for a longer period of time.    The
expansion phase of COSMIC-HF was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of the modified release oral formulation omecamtiv mecarbil selected based on the results of the two dose escalation cohorts
in 448 patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil 25 mg twice daily or a dose titration group where 25 mg twice daily
dosing could be increased to 50 mg twice daily depending on plasma concentrations of omecamtiv mecarbil after two weeks of treatment with the 25 mg dose.  
 In November 2015, the results from the expansion phase of COSMIC-HF (Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in
Heart Failure) were presented in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trial session at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2015 in Orlando, Florida. Data from the expansion phase showed that dose titration controlled patient exposure to omecamtiv
mecarbil. Approximately 60 percent of patients in the dose titration group escalated dosing to 50 mg twice daily. The study met its primary pharmacokinetics objective.  
 Following 20 weeks of treatment, statistically significant improvements were observed in pre-specified secondary endpoint measures of cardiac
function in the dose titration group, compared to placebo. Systolic ejection time increased by 25.0 msec ( p  0.001), stroke volume increased by 3.63 mL ( p= 0.022) and heart rate decreased by 2.97 beats per min ( p =0.007). Left
ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions decreased by 1.79 mm ( p =0.003) and 1.29 mm ( p= 0.013), respectively, and were associated with statistically significant reductions in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic
volumes. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) decreased by 970 pg/mL ( p =0.007). Additionally, in the 25 mg twice daily group, there were statistically significant increases in systolic ejection time and stroke volume and a
decrease in NT-proBNP. All changes are from baseline compared to placebo. The pharmacodynamic effects of omecamtiv mecarbil were generally dose dependent and larger in patients that received oral dosing with 50 mg twice daily.  
 Increases in systolic ejection time (SET) and stroke volume, and decreases in LV end-systolic volume, were similar after both 12 and 20 weeks
of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil; however, LV end-diastolic volume decreased progressively from 12 to 20 weeks, with the decrease after 20 weeks nearly twice that observed after 12 weeks. NT-proBNP (a biomarker that is elevated in heart
failure, with higher elevations reflecting more severe heart failure) also fell progressively over time and, of particular note, had declined even further four weeks after treatment discontinuation (-1306   376 pg/mL; p=0.0006). Heart
rate also declined significantly after 2, 12 and 20 weeks of treatment ranging from 2-4 beats per minute and returning nearly to baseline four weeks after treatment discontinuation (-1.2 1.2 beats/min: p = 0.29).  
 Adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs, in patients on omecamtiv mecarbil were comparable to placebo. The incidence of
adjudicated deaths (2.7 percent died on placebo, 1.4 percent died on omecamtiv mecarbil), myocardial infarction (1.34 percent on placebo, 0.34 percent on omecamtiv mecarbil) and unstable angina (0 percent on placebo, 0.34 percent
on omecamtiv mecarbil) was similar. Other cardiac AEs were generally balanced between placebo and active treatment groups. In the omecamtiv mecarbil groups, compared to placebo, cardiac troponin increased by 0.001 ng/mL and 0.006
ng/mL (median change from baseline at week 20) in the 25 mg twice daily group and dose titration group, respectively. Events of increased troponin (n=278 across all treatment groups) were independently adjudicated and none were determined to be
myocardial ischemia or infarction.

  On April 4, 2016, we announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil
in Japanese subjects with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.    Also in March 2016, the manuscript,  Acute Treatment with
Omecamtiv Mecarbil to Increase Contractility in Acute Heart Failure, The ATOMIC-AHF Study,  was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Results from this trial were first presented at the European Society of Cardiology
Meeting in 2013.    During 2016, we participated with Amgen in regulatory meetings with the FDA, EMA and Health Canada intended to inform
design of a potential Phase 3 development program for omecamtiv mecarbil. We also conducted various clinical; non-clinical; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC), and planning activities in collaboration with Amgen to support the potential
advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil into a Phase 3 development program. In September 2016, we announced Amgen s decision to advance omecamtiv mecarbil into Phase 3 clinical development with a cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial expected to
initiate in the fourth quarter of 2016. As part of the Phase 3 clinical trials program, Cytokinetics and Amgen are also planning a potential exercise performance/cardiac function clinical trial to be conducted by Cytokinetics. Amgen will be
responsible for reimbursing us for the out-of-pocket development costs associated with this clinical trial.    In September 2016, additional
results from COSMIC-HF were presented in a Rapid Fire Abstract Session at the Hart Failure Society of America Scientific Meeting in Orlando, Florida. The results showed that omecamtiv mecarbil may improve symptoms in patients with moderate to severe
heart failure symptoms versus placebo after 20 weeks of double-blind treatment, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score (TSS), one of the sub-domains of a self-administered questionnaire that measures
quality-of-life in patients with heart failure. At week 20, the TSS was increased (with increases in the score reflecting improvement) in a dose-related fashion, with a 4.9 point improvement in the PK-guided dose titration group (p=0.03). This
improvement was greater among patients who were moderately to severely symptomatic at baseline, with the largest magnitude in the PK-guided dose titration treatment group (6.5, p=0.09). Patients who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic had modest
improvements in the TSS.      Ongoing Research in Cardiac Muscle Contractility    
 We are continuing our joint research program with Amgen directed to next-generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program in
2016. Under the Amgen Agreement, Amgen reimburses us for certain research activities we perform.    The clinical trials program for
omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years, and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed, regulatory approval is achieved,
and the drug is commercialized. Omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur. We funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to Amgen s option exercise in
May 2009. We anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical
development. Our expenditures will also increase if Amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently, or if we elect to co-fund later-stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other
compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with Amgen.     Beyond Muscle Contractility   
 We have developed preclinical expertise in the mechanics of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle that extends from proteins to tissues to intact
animal models. Our translational research in muscle contractility has enabled us to better understand the potential impact of small molecule compounds that increase skeletal or cardiac muscle contractility and to apply those findings to the further
evaluation of our drug candidates in clinical populations. In addition to contractility, the other major functions of muscle include metabolism, growth and energetics, with each of these functions playing a role in certain diseases that could
benefit from novel mechanism treatments. Accordingly, our knowledge of muscle contractility may serve as an entry point to the discovery of novel treatments for disorders involving muscle functions other than muscle contractility. We are leveraging
our current understandings of muscle biology to investigate new ways of modulating these other aspects of muscle function for other potential therapeutic applications.  
  Development Risks     The successful
development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature, timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of
completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:      

the results of clinical trials of our drug candidates conducted by us or our partners may not support the further clinical development of those drug candidates;    
      Page 35  

Table of Contents  

further clinical development of tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS will require significant additional funding and we may be unable to obtain such additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all;

the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept effects on respiratory function, including SVC, as appropriate clinical trial endpoints to support the registration of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS;

the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities may not accept the data from the clinical trials of tirasemtiv as sufficient to determine the safest and most effective dose of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS;

decisions made by Amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and by Astellas with respect to the development of CK-2127107;    

the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our or our partners  clinical trials;    

the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed;    

our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms, if at all, including, but not limited to, our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to
assist in the design, management, conduct and funding of clinical trials;        

failure by our clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations, clinical manufacturing organizations and other third parties supporting our or our partners  clinical trials to fulfill their obligations or
otherwise perform as expected;        

delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use, including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates;    

the uncertainty of clinical trial results, including variability in patient response;        

the uncertainty of obtaining FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates;    

the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility;    

the possibility that results from non-clinical studies may adversely impact the timing or further development of our drug candidates; and    

possible delays in the characterization, formulation, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of drug candidates and other compounds.    
 If we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our
operations, financial position and liquidity. In addition, any failure by us or our partners to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A
further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs as planned, or at all, and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled  We will need substantial
additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations,   We have never generated, and may never generate, revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if
ever,   Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval  and  Clinical trials
are expensive, time-consuming and subject to delay,  and other risk factors.

   Results of Operations   
   Revenues      Total revenues for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows (in thousands):      
   Research and development revenues from related parties refers to research and development revenues from our
strategic alliances with Astellas and Amgen. Research and development revenue for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 included research and development revenues from Astellas of $5.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and consisted of
reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents, reimbursements of research and development expenses, and research and development milestone fees; and research and development revenues from Amgen of $0.6 million and $0.6
million, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents. Research and development revenue for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 included research and development revenues from Astellas
of $11.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents, and other research and development expenses; and research and development revenues from Amgen of $1.8
million and $1.9 million, respectively, and consisted of reimbursements of internal costs of certain full-time employee equivalents. The increase in research and development revenues from related parties for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to the timing of research and development activities under the Astellas collaboration agreement.  
 Research and development, grant and other revenues in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2016, consisted of $0.3 million and
$0.8 million, respectively, of research and development revenues from our collaboration with The ALS Association ( ALSA ). In July 2015, we were awarded a $1.5 million grant from ALSA (the  ALSA Grant ) to support the conduct of
VITALITY-ALS as well as the collection of clinical data and plasma samples from patients in VITALITY-ALS in order to help advance the discovery of potentially useful biomarkers in ALS.  
 License revenues from related parties refers to license revenues from our strategic alliance with Astellas. License revenues from related
parties for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 were $53.0 million and $4.1 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of the recognition of the $50.0 million upfront license fee received from Astellas under the 2016 Amendment, using the
proportional performance model. License revenues from related parties for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were $59.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, and consisted of the recognition of the $50.0 million upfront license fee
received from Astellas under the 2016 Amendment, using the proportional performance model. The increase in license revenue from related parties for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and the increase in license revenues
from related parties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to the license revenue associated with the expansion of the Astellas collaboration agreement, which was effective in
September 2016. Refer to Note 4,  Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for the accounting treatment, including the allocation of consideration to the
units of accounting, and the revenue recognition of License Revenue and Research and Development Revenue, under the 2016 Amendment.      Research and
Development Expenses (As Restated)      Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, were as follows (in thousands):      
   The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase of $5.1 million in outsourced preclinical and clinical costs mainly associated with the ongoing VITALITY-ALS and CK-2127107 trials, and an increase of $1.1 million in personnel related
expenses due to increased headcount costs and increased non-cash stock compensation expense.  
      Page 37  

Table of Contents  

  The increase in research and development expenses for the first nine months of 2016, compared to
the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase of $8.0 million in outsourced clinical costs, an increase of $3.5 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and increased non-cash stock compensation expense, partially
offset by a decrease of $3.6 million in outsourced preclinical costs mainly associated with clinical manufacturing activities. The increase in outsourced clinical costs comprised of an increase of $12.5 million in outsourced clinical costs mainly
associated with the ongoing VITALITY-ALS and CK-2127107 trials, offset by a $4.5 million litigation settlement in June 2016 from a contract research organization for our BENEFIT-ALS clinical trial which was concluded in 2014.  
 The following presents our research and development expenses by program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively (in thousands):      
   From a program perspective, the increase in research and development spending for the third quarter of 2016,
compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending of $6.6 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included the clinical program for tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS, and the clinical programs for
CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and increased spending of $0.3 million for our cardiac muscle contractility program, partially offset by decreased spending of $0.6 million for our other research programs. The $6.6 million increase
in our skeletal muscle contractility program spending mainly comprised of an increase of $6.3 million in research and development spending associated with tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS and an increase of $0.2 million in research and
development spending associated with CK-2127107, respectively.    From a program perspective, the increase in research and development
spending for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending of $7.8 million for our skeletal muscle contractility program, which included the clinical program for tirasemtiv for the
treatment of ALS, and the clinical programs for CK-2127107 under our collaboration with Astellas, and increased spending of $1.6 million for our cardiac muscle contractility program, partially offset by decreased spending of $1.4 million for our
other research programs. The $7.8 million increase in our skeletal muscle contractility program spending mainly comprised of an increase of $11.3 million in research and development spending associated with the tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS,
and an increase of $1.3 million in research and development spending associated with CK-2127107, respectively, partially offset by a $4.5 million litigation settlement in June 2016 from a contract research organization for our BENEFIT-ALS clinical
trial which was concluded in 2014.    Clinical development timelines, likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly
for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate. We anticipate that we will determine on an ongoing basis which research and development programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program, taking into account the scientific and
clinical success of each drug candidate. The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain, or any
delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  
 We expect our research and development expenditures to increase significantly in 2016 compared to 2015. We expect to continue the Phase 3
clinical development of our drug candidate tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. Under our strategic alliance with Astellas, we expect to continue development of our drug candidate CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA, COPD, ALS
and potentially other diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting. Under our strategic alliance with Amgen, we expect to continue development of our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of
heart failure.

    General and Administrative Expenses    
 General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows (in
thousands):      
   The increase in general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the same period
in 2015, was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and increased non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $0.4 million in outsourced costs mainly related to commercial
development and information technology, and an increase of $0.2 million in corporate and patent legal fees.    The increase in general and
administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending of $3.3 million in personnel related expenses due to increased headcount and increased non-cash stock compensation
expense, an increase of $1.9 million in outsourced costs related to commercial development, grants and sponsorships, and accounting and finance, and an increase of $1.6 million in corporate and patent legal fees.  
 We anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2016 will increase significantly compared to 2015, mainly due to increased
headcount.      Interest Expense    
 Interest expense increased in the third quarter of 2016 and for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to
interest expense related to the long-term debt obligations which commenced in fourth quarter 2015.     Critical Accounting Policies   
 The accounting policies that we consider to be our most critical (i.e., those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments), the effects of those accounting policies applied and the judgments made in their application are summarized in   Item 7  
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. There has been
no material change to our critical accounting policies since then.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 See Note 1,  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, and their expected impact on our financial position and results of operations.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources     From
August 5, 1997, our date of inception, through September 30, 2016, we funded our operations through the sale of equity securities, non-equity payments from collaborators, long term debt, capital equipment financings, grants and interest
income. Due to our substantial research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures are primarily related to research and development activities. As of September 30, 2016,
we had available cash, cash equivalents and investments of $86.3 million.     Original Astellas Agreement   
 In June 2013, we entered into the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 4,  Related Party Research and Development Arrangements  in
the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). In July 2013, we received an upfront non-refundable license payment of $16.0 million in connection with the execution of the Original Astellas Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement
we were eligible to potentially receive over $24.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored research and development activities during the initial two years of the collaboration. In addition, the agreement also provided for payments for the achievement
of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research and development program. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized no revenues for milestones achieved under the Original
Astellas Agreement. The $15.0 million milestone payment which was paid in January 2015 was recognized in 2014.

   2014 Astellas Agreement   
 In December 2014, we entered into the 2014 Astellas Agreement, which superseded the Original Astellas Agreement (see Note 4,  Related
Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $30.0 million in January
2015. In conjunction with the 2014 Astellas Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 2,040,816 shares common stock to Astellas at a price per share of $4.90. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0
million was received in December 2014. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Astellas to be $9.1 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $0.9 million was deferred and will be recognized as revenue as services are
performed over approximately 24 months.    We are eligible to potentially receive over $20.0 million in reimbursement of sponsored
research and development activities during the three years of the collaboration through 2017. In addition, we may also receive payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the 2014 Astellas Agreement.  
 Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, Cytokinetics may receive over $600.0 million in milestone payments relating to the
development and commercial launch of collaboration products, including up to $95.0 million relating to CK-2127107 in non-neuromuscular indications, and over $100.0 million in development and commercial launch milestones for CK-2127107 in each
of SMA, ALS and other neuromuscular indications. Cytokinetics may also receive up to $200.0 million in payments for achievement of pre-specified sales milestones related to net sales of all collaboration products under the 2014 Astellas Agreement.
If Astellas commercializes any collaboration products, Cytokinetics will also receive royalties on sales of such collaboration products, including royalties ranging from the high single digits to the high teens on sales of products containing
CK-2127107. Cytokinetics also holds an option to co-fund certain development costs for CK-2127107 and other compounds in exchange for increased milestone payments and royalties; such royalties may increase under certain scenarios to exceed twenty
percent. In addition to the foregoing development, commercial launch and sales milestones, Cytokinetics may also receive payments for the achievement of pre-specified milestones relating to the joint research program.  
  2016 Astellas Amendment (Inclusion of ALS as an Added Indication and Option on Tirasemtiv)   
 In July 2016, Cytokinetics entered into the 2016 Amendment to the 2014 Astellas Agreement. Under the 2016 Amendment, we granted Astellas an
option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, Astellas will receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for Astellas
outside Cytokinetics  commercialization territory in North America, Europe and other select countries. In addition, the 2016 Amendment expands our collaboration with Astellas to include the development of CK-2127107 for the potential treatment
of ALS, as well as other fast skeletal regulatory activators licensed to Astellas under the 2014 Agreement. Finally, the 2016 Amendment extends the existing joint research program focused on the discovery of additional next-generation skeletal
muscle activators through 2017, including sponsored research at Cytokinetics.    The 2016 Amendment was subject to clearance under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and beacame effective on September 26, 2016, the date of such clearance.    In connection with
the execution of the 2016 Amendment, we received a $15.0 million non-refundable option fee for the grant of the option on tirasemtiv. Prior to Astellas  exercise of the option, we will continue the development of tirasemtiv, including the
VITALITY-ALS trial, at our own expense to support regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and certain other jurisdictions and will retain the final decision making authority on the development of tirasemtiv. If Astellas exercises the option, we will
grant Astellas an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv outside Cytokinetics  own commercialization territory of North America, Europe and other select countries. Each party would be primarily responsible for the further
development of tirasemtiv in its territory and have the exclusive right to commercialize tirasemtiv in its territory.    Also in connection
with the execution of the 2016 Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront amendment fee of $35.0 million. We also received the accelerated payment of a $15.0 million milestone payment for the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial of
CK-2127107 as the lead compound in ALS that was otherwise provide for in the 2014 Astellas Agreement, as if such milestone has been achieved upon the execution of the 2016 Amendment. The parties will share equally the costs of developing CK-2127107
in ALS for potential registration and marketing authorization in the U.S. and Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of CK-2127107 in ALS, subject to a right to recoup Cytokinetics  share of
such costs plus a 100% premium by reducing future milestone and royalty payments to Cytokinetics, and (ii) Cytokinetics may defer (but not eliminate) a portion of its co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18
months, subject to certain conditions. Cytokinetics has the right to co-fund its share of such Phase 2 development costs on a current basis, in which case there would not be a premium due to Astellas. We are also eligible to potentially receive
approximately $44.2 million in additional sponsored research and development funding through 2018 which includes Astellas  funding of Cytokinetics  conduct of the Phase 2 clinical development of CK-2127107 in ALS (approximately $39.1
million) as well as the continuing research collaboration (approximately $5.1 million).

Table of Contents  

  If Astellas exercises its option for a global collaboration for the development and
commercialization of tirasemtiv, Cytokinetics will receive an option exercise payment ranging from $25.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of data from the VITALITY-ALS trial) to $80.0 million (if exercise occurs following receipt of FDA
approval). In addition, we are eligible to receive a potential milestone payment from Astellas associated with Cytokinetics  initiation of the VIGOR-ALS open-label extension trial for tirasemtiv. Such milestone would be $30.0 million; provided,
however, that the amount will be reduced to $15.0 million if (i) Astellas elects to pay such milestone payment at the time the trial commences (if prior to Astellas  exercise of its option on tirasemtiv) or (ii) Astellas has exercised
said option as of the time the trial commences. Cytokinetics will be responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv during the option period, but if Astellas  exercises the option after the defined review period following receipt of data
from VITALITY-ALS, Astellas will at the time of option exercise reimburse Cytokinetics for a share of any additional costs incurred after such review period.  
 If Astellas exercises the option for tirasemtiv, the parties will share the future development costs of tirasemtiv in North America, Europe
and certain other countries (with Cytokinetics bearing 75% of such shared costs and Astellas bearing 25% of such costs), and Astellas will be solely responsible for the development costs of tirasemtiv specific to its commercialization territory.
Contingent upon the successful development of tirasemtiv, we may receive milestone payments up to $100.0 million for the initial indication and up to $50.0 million for each subsequent indication. If tirasemtiv is commercialized, Astellas will pay us
royalties (at rates ranging from the mid-teens to twenty percent) on sales of tirasemtiv in Astellas  territory, and we will pay Astellas royalties (at rates up to the mid-teens) on sales of tirasemtiv in our commercialization territory, in
each case subject to various possible adjustments.     Amgen Agreement Amendment   
 In June 2013, we entered into the Amgen Agreement Amendment, which expanded our strategic alliance to include Japan (see Note 4,  Related
Party Research and Development Arrangements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we received a non-refundable upfront license fee of $15 million in June 2013.
In conjunction with the Amgen Agreement Amendment, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 1,404,100 shares common stock to Amgen at a price per share of $7.12. The aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million
was received in June 2013. We determined the fair value of the stock issued to Amgen to be $7.5 million. The excess of cash received over fair value of $2.5 million was deferred and was recognized as revenue as services were performed over
approximately 12 months.    Under the Amgen Agreement as amended, we are eligible for potential pre-commercialization and commercialization
milestone payments of over $650.0 million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration, and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products
commercialized under the agreement.    Amgen and the Company agreed to further extend the term of the research program in 2016. Under the
amended Amgen Agreement, we are entitled to receive reimbursements of internal costs for certain full-time employee equivalents during 2016, as well as potential additional milestone payments related to the research activities.  
  Cantor Fitzgerald     On September 4,
2015, we entered into a $40.0 million Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement ( CE Offering ) with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., pursuant to which we issue and sold, through September 30, 2016, 808,193 shares for total net
proceeds of approximately $8.7 million. As of September 30, 2016, $31.3 million remains available to us under the September 2015 Registration Statement.  
  Warrants issued in June 2012 Public Offerings   
 On June 20, 2012, we entered into underwriting agreements for two separate, concurrent offerings of our securities (the  June 2012
Public Offerings ). The warrants issued in the June 2012 Public Offerings became exercisable upon issuance and will remain exercisable until June 25, 2017. In August 2016, warrants to purchase 104,533 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $5.28 per share were exercised in accordance with the June 2012 Public Offerings underwriting agreements. In September 2016, we issued 690,580 shares of common stock related to cashless exercise of warrants. As of September 30,
2016, warrants to purchase 4,168,914 shares of our common stock were outstanding and exercisable.

   October 2015 Loan Agreement   
 On October 19, 2015 and February 10, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Oxford
Finance LLC ( Oxford, ) as the collateral agent and a lender, and Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB, ) as a lender (Oxford and SVB collectively the  Lenders ) to fund our working capital and other general corporate needs, for
Term A and Term B, respectively. We can, in our sole discretion, draw down an additional $10.0 million under the Loan Agreement from the Lenders, at any time prior to March 31, 2017, subject to Cytokinetics  satisfaction of specified
conditions precedent related to the earlier of (i) the occurrence of an equity even as described in the Loan Agreement, or (ii) specified results from the Company s VITALITY-ALS Phase 3 trial of tirasemtiv, each as specified in the
Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2016 we received $29.8 million from these loan and security agreements for Term A and Term B, net of issuance cost. See Note 8,  Long-Term Debt  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further details.     Sources and Uses of Cash   
 Our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $86.3 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $111.6 million at December 31,
2015. The decrease of $25.3 million was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of $40.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $15.0 million received from long-term debt.  
 Net cash used in operating activities was $40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and was largely due to the ongoing
research and development activities, and general and administrative spend to support those activities. The net income of $9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included non-cash stock based compensation of $5.3 million. At
September 30, 2016, deferred revenue of $26.1 million related to the deferral of revenue for Astellas based on the proportional performance model; and related party accounts receivable included $65 million that was received from Astellas in
October 2016, related to the 2016 Astellas Amendment.    Net cash used in investing activities was $10.1 million for the first nine months
of 2016 was primarily due to purchases of investments, exceeding proceeds from the maturity of investments, by $9.4 million.    Net cash
provided by financing activities was $16.2 million for the first nine months of 2016 and primarily consisted of net proceeds received of $15.0 million from long-term debt.  
  Shelf Registration Statements.     In
November 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which was declared effective in December 2013 (the  December 2013 Shelf ). The December 2013 Shelf allowed us to issue common stock and preferred stock, and/or warrants to
purchase any of such securities with a total value of up to $150.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, $109.7 million remains available to us under the December 2013 Shelf. The specific terms of offerings, if any, under the December 2013 Shelf will
be established at the time of such offerings.    As of September 30, 2016, our contractual obligations are as follows (in thousands):

  In future periods, we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research
programs and related research and development activities. We plan to continue development of our fast skeletal muscle troponin activator tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. We plan to continue development of our fast skeletal muscle
troponin activator CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA, COPD, ALS and potentially other diseases and conditions related to skeletal muscle weakness or wasting and research of potential next-generation compounds as part of our strategic
alliance with Astellas. We plan to continue to support the development of our cardiac muscle myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure and the research of potential next-generation compounds as part of our
strategic alliance with Amgen. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of compounds from our other muscle biology programs through research to candidate selection.  
 Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  

the initiation, progress, timing, scope and completion of preclinical research, non-clinical development, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC), and clinical trials for our drug candidates and other compounds;

the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;        

delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies;        

Amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds for the potential treatment of heart failure under our collaboration;    

Astellas  decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of CK-2127107 or other skeletal muscle activators under our collaboration;    

our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates;        

the number of drug candidates we pursue;        

the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims;        

our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs;    

our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities, including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates;    

our plans or ability to engage third party manufacturers for our drug candidates and potential drugs;        

our plans or ability to build or access sales and marketing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs;        

the expansion and advancement of our research programs;        

the hiring of additional employees and consultants;        

the expansion of our facilities;        

the acquisition of technologies, products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments; and        

our revenues, if any, from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs.    
 We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $525.4 million since inception and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability. We
are subject to risks common to clinical-stage companies including, but not limited to, development of new drug candidates, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed to fund our future plans. Our
liquidity will be impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our common stock and convertible preferred stock, contract payments
under our collaboration agreements, debt financing arrangements, grants and interest income. Until we achieve profitable operations, we intend to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations, additional sales of equity
securities, grants and debt financings. We have never generated revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and may not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever. Our success is dependent on our ability to obtain additional capital by
entering into new strategic collaborations and/or through equity or debt financings, and ultimately on our and our collaborators  ability to successfully develop and market one or more of our drug candidates. We cannot be certain that
sufficient funds will be available from such collaborators or financings when needed or on satisfactory terms. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of drugs based on our drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any
future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows.  
      Page 43  

Table of Contents  

  Based on the current status of our development plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash
equivalents, investments and interest earned on investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. If, at any time, our prospects for internally financing our research and development
programs decline, we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying, discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or of other research and development programs. Alternatively, we
might raise funds through strategic relationships, public or private financings or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that funding, if needed, will be available on attractive terms, or at all, or in accordance with our planned timelines.
Furthermore, financing obtained through future strategic relationships may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates. Similarly, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt
financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     We are
not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.      

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES          

(a) 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures      In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, filed on November 3, 2016, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a
reasonable assurance level. Subsequent to that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, because of the
material weakness described below.    Material Weakness  
 A material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the restatement of our condensed consolidated financial statements and
revised management s assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, we identified the following material weakness.  
 We did not maintain effective internal controls over the accounting for the completeness, accuracy and presentation and disclosure of clinical
research and development expenses and related clinical accrual accounts due to a design deficiency in the review of clinical trial expenses incurred under our clinical research organization trial agreements, including in part, our review of
information received from third party service providers that is used in the operation of this control. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of our clinical research and development expenses, related clinical accrual accounts and
related financial disclosures as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result in
a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.    Management s Remediation
Initiatives    Our management is committed to the planning and implementation of remediation to address this material weakness. These
remediation efforts, summarized below, which is in the process of being implemented or are planned for implementation, are intended to address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall financial control environment.  
 With the oversight of management and our Audit Committee, we plan to take steps intended to address the underlying causes of the material
weakness in the immediate future, primarily through the following:      

Process improvements: We have commenced the redesign of specific processes and controls associated with review of clinical trial expenses and related clinical accrual balance sheet accounts, including enhanced review
procedures around monthly fluctuation analysis and additional review procedures on reports received from third party service providers.       
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting  
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    (c) Limitations on the effectiveness of
controls    A control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the controls are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Accordingly, our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met.

    PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS       In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks
in addition to the other information in this report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or your investment in our securities, and many are beyond our control. The
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also adversely affect our business.   
  Risks Related To Our Business       We
have a history of significant losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.    
 We have generally incurred operating losses in each year since our inception in 1997, due to costs incurred in connection with our research and
development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Our drug candidates are all in early through late-stage clinical testing, and we and our partners must conduct significant additional clinical trials before
we and our partners can seek the regulatory approvals necessary to begin commercial sales of our drugs. We expect to incur increasing losses for at least several more years, as we continue our research activities and conduct development of, and seek
regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates, and commercialize any approved drugs. If our drug candidates fail or do not gain regulatory approval, or if our drugs do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be profitable. If we fail to become
and remain profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, you could lose all or part of your investment.      We will
need substantial additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations.      We have consumed substantial amounts of
capital to date, and our operating expenditures will increase over the next several years if we expand our research and development activities. We have funded all of our operations and capital expenditures with proceeds from private and public sales
of our equity securities, strategic alliances with Amgen, Astellas and others, long term debt, equipment financings, interest on investments, government grants and other grants. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and interest earned on investments should be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our drug candidates and other research and development activities, including risks and uncertainties that
could impact the rate of progress of our development activities, we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with these activities.  
      Page 45  

Table of Contents  

  For the foreseeable future, our operations will require significant additional funding, in large
part due to our research and development expenses and the absence of any revenues from product sales. For example, we will require significant additional funding to enable us to conduct further development of tirasemtiv for the potential treatment
of ALS, including any additional Phase 3 clinical trials that may be required by regulatory authorities to receive marketing approval for tirasemtiv. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, we expect to raise future capital
through strategic alliance and licensing arrangements, public or private equity offerings and debt financings. We do not currently have any commitments for future funding other than reimbursements, milestone and royalty payments that we may receive
under our collaboration agreements with Amgen and Astellas. We may not receive any further funds under those agreements. Our ability to raise funds may be adversely impacted by current economic conditions. As a result of these and other factors, we
do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or that, if available, such financing would be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us.  
 To the extent that we raise additional funds through strategic alliances or licensing and other arrangements with third parties, we will
likely have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our
stockholders will experience additional dilution and our share price may decline. To the extent that we raise additional funds through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. In addition, funding
from any of these sources, if needed, may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, or in accordance with our planned timelines.  
 If we cannot raise the funds we need to operate our business, we will need to delay or discontinue certain research and development
activities. For example, if we cannot raise the funds necessary to enable the conduct of further development for tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS, our ability to continue the development of tirasemtiv will be delayed or suspended. If we
delay or discontinue research and development activities, our stock price may be negatively affected.      Covenants in our loan and
security agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations may not provide
sufficient revenue to meet the condition required in order to access the final loan available under the agreement and may also not provide sufficient cash to meet the repayment obligations of our debt incurred under the loan and security agreement.
     Our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley Bank provides for up to $40.0 million in term loans due
on October 1, 2020, of which $30.0 million in term loans has been borrowed to date. All of our current and future assets, except for intellectual property, are secured for our borrowings under the loan and security agreement. The loan and
security agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants applicable to us, including among other things, covenants restricting dispositions, changes in business, management, ownership or business locations, mergers or acquisitions,
indebtedness, encumbrances, distributions, investments, transactions with affiliates and subordinated debt, any of which could restrict our business and operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified
actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the loan and security agreement, which could permit the lenders to declare all
or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the loan and security agreement. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the loan and security agreement
could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business. In addition, should we be unable to comply with these covenants or if we default on any portion of our outstanding borrowings, the
lenders can also impose a 5.0% penalty and restrict access to additional borrowings under the loan and security agreement. Moreover, our ability to access the final $10.0 million under the loan and security agreement is subject to our ability to
achieve a certain conditions, including certain clinical development milestones or an equity financing milestone, which conditions we may not be able to meet and which and could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, although we expect to
borrow additional funds under the loan and security agreement, before we do so, we must first satisfy ourselves that we will have access to future alternate sources of capital, including cash flow from our own operations, equity capital markets or
debt capital markets in order to repay any principal borrowed, which we may be unable to do, in which case, our liquidity and ability to fund our operations may be substantially impaired.

    We have never generated, and may never generate, revenues from commercial sales of our
drugs and we will not have drugs to market for at least several years, if ever.      We currently have no drugs for sale and we cannot
guarantee that we will ever develop or obtain approval to market any drugs. To receive marketing approval for any drug candidate, we must demonstrate that the drug candidate satisfies rigorous standards of safety and efficacy to the FDA in the
United States and other regulatory authorities abroad. We and our partners will need to conduct significant additional research and preclinical and clinical testing before we or our partners can file applications with the FDA or other regulatory
authorities for approval of any of our drug candidates. In addition, to compete effectively, our drugs must be easy to use, cost-effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale, compared to other therapies available for the treatment
of the same conditions. We may not achieve any of these objectives. Currently, our only drug candidates in clinical development are tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS, CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA, COPD, ALS and
potentially other neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular indications associated with muscle weakness and omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure. We cannot be certain that the clinical development of these or any future drug
candidates will be successful, that they will receive the regulatory approvals required to commercialize them, that they will ultimately be accepted by prescribers or reimbursed by insurers or that any of our other research programs will yield a
drug candidate suitable for clinical testing or commercialization. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of drugs that we do not expect to be commercially marketed for at least several years, if at all. The development of any
one or all of these drug candidates may be discontinued at any stage of our clinical trials programs and we may not generate revenue from any of these drug candidates.  
   Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, which could prevent or significantly
delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval.      Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug
candidates, we or our partners must adequately demonstrate to the satisfaction of FDA and foreign regulatory authorities that the drug candidate is sufficiently safe and effective with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials. We or
our partners will need to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of specific indications and monitor safety throughout the clinical development process and following approval. None of our drug candidates have yet met the safety
and efficacy standards required for regulatory approval for commercialization and they may never do so. In addition, for each of our preclinical compounds, we or our partners must adequately demonstrate satisfactory chemistry, formulation, stability
and toxicity in order to submit an investigational new drug application ( IND ) to the FDA, or an equivalent application in foreign jurisdictions, that would allow us to advance that compound into clinical trials. Furthermore, we or our
partners may need to submit separate INDs (or foreign equivalent) to different divisions within the FDA (or foreign regulatory authorities) in order to pursue clinical trials in different therapeutic areas. Each new IND (or foreign equivalent) must
be reviewed by the new division before the clinical trial under its jurisdiction can proceed, entailing all the risks of delay inherent to regulatory review. If our or our partners  current or future preclinical studies or clinical trials are
unsuccessful, our business will be significantly harmed and our stock price could be negatively affected.    All of our drug candidates are
prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Preclinical studies may not yield results that would adequately support the filing of an IND (or a foreign equivalent) with respect to our potential drug candidates. Even if the results of
preclinical studies for a drug candidate are sufficient to support such a filing, the results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict the results of clinical trials. As an example, because the physiology of animal species used in
preclinical studies may vary substantially from other animal species and from humans, it may be difficult to assess with certainty whether a finding from a study in a particular animal species will result in similar findings in other animal species
or in humans. For any of our drug candidates, the results from Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and clinical results from Phase 1 and 2 trials in patients are not necessarily indicative of the results of later and larger clinical trials
that are necessary to establish whether the drug candidate is safe and effective for the applicable indication. Likewise, interim results from a clinical trial may not be indicative of the final results from that trial, and results from early Phase
2 clinical trials may not be indicative of the results from later clinical trials. For example, early Phase 2 clinical trials of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS showed encouraging dose-related trends in measurements of the ALS Functional Rating
Scale in its revised form (ALSFRS-R), a clinically validated instrument designed to measure disease progression and changes in functional status, for patients receiving tirasemtiv compared to those receiving placebo. However, BENEFIT-ALS, a Phase 2b
clinical trial of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS, did not achieve its primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline in the ALSFRS-R for patients receiving tirasemtiv compared to those receiving placebo.  
 In addition, while the clinical trials of our drug candidates are designed based on the available relevant information, such information may
not accurately predict what actually occurs during the course of the trial itself, which may have consequences for the conduct of an ongoing clinical trial or for the eventual results of that trial. For example, the number of patients planned to be
enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial is determined in part by estimates relating to expected treatment effect and variability about the primary endpoint. These estimates are based upon earlier nonclinical and clinical studies of the drug
candidate itself and clinical trials of other drugs thought to have similar effects in a similar patient population. If information gained during the conduct of the trial shows these estimates to be inaccurate, we may elect to adjust the enrollment
accordingly, which may cause delays in completing the trial, additional expense or a statistical penalty to apply to the evaluation of the trial results.  
      Page 47

  Furthermore, in view of the uncertainties inherent in drug development, such clinical trials may
not be designed with focus on indications, patient populations, dosing regimens, endpoints, safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetic parameters or other variables that will provide the necessary safety or efficacy data to support regulatory approval to
commercialize the resulting drugs. For example, we believe that effects on respiratory function, including slow vital capacity (SVC), may be appropriate as a clinical endpoint for tirasemtiv; however, regulatory authorities may not accept these
effects as a clinical endpoint to support registration of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS. Clinical trials of our drug candidates are designed based on guidance or advice from regulatory agencies, which is subject to change during the
development of the drug candidate at any time. Such a change in a regulatory agency s guidance or advice may cause that agency to deem results from trials to be insufficient to support approval of the drug candidate and require further clinical
trials of that drug candidate to be conducted. In addition, individual patient responses to the dose administered of a drug may vary in a manner that is difficult to predict. Also, the methods we select to assess particular safety, efficacy or
pharmacokinetic parameters may not yield the same statistical precision in estimating our drug candidates  effects as may other methodologies. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising,
these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Non-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data
in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.    Administering any of our drug
candidates or potential drug candidates may produce undesirable side effects, also known as adverse events. Toxicities and adverse events observed in preclinical studies for some compounds in a particular research and development program may also
occur in preclinical studies or clinical trials of other compounds from the same program. Potential toxicity issues may arise from the effects of the active pharmaceutical ingredient itself or from impurities or degradants that are present in the
active pharmaceutical ingredient or could form over time in the formulated drug candidate or the active pharmaceutical ingredient. These toxicities or adverse events could delay or prevent the filing of an IND (or a foreign equivalent) with respect
to our drug candidates or potential drug candidates or cause us, our partners or the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to modify, suspend or terminate clinical trials with respect to any drug candidate at any time during the development program.
Further, the administration of two or more drugs contemporaneously can lead to interactions between them, and our drug candidates may interact with other drugs that trial subjects are taking. For example, co-administration of tirasemtiv and riluzole
(an approved treatment for ALS) approximately doubles the average maximum riluzole plasma level. If the adverse events are severe or frequent enough to outweigh the potential efficacy of a drug candidate, the FDA or other regulatory authorities
could deny approval of that drug candidate for any or all targeted indications. Even if one or more of our drug candidates were approved for sale as drugs, the occurrence of even a limited number of toxicities or adverse events when used in large
populations may cause the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to impose restrictions on, or stop, the further marketing of those drugs. Indications of potential adverse events or toxicities which do not seem significant during the course of
clinical trials may later turn out to actually constitute serious adverse events or toxicities when a drug is used in large populations or for extended periods of time.  
 We have observed certain adverse events in the clinical trials conducted with our drug candidates. For example, in BENEFIT-ALS, adverse events
of dizziness, fatigue, nausea, confusional state, muscle spasms, somnolence (sleepiness), decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and dysathria (difficulty speaking) occurred more frequently during treatment with
tirasemtiv than with placebo. In addition, weight loss was significantly greater in patients with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., nausea and decreased appetite), which occurred more frequently on tirasemtiv than on placebo. In clinical
trials of omecamtiv mecarbil, adverse events of chest discomfort, palpitations, dizziness and feeling hot, increases in heart rate, declines in blood pressure, electrocardiographic changes consistent with acute myocardial ischemia and transient
rises in the MB fraction of creatine kinase and cardiac troponins I and T, which are indicative of myocardial infarction were observed during treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil.  
 In addition, clinical trials of tirasemtiv and omecamtiv mecarbil enroll patients who typically suffer from serious diseases which put them at
increased risk of death. These patients may die while receiving our drug candidates. In such circumstances, it may not be possible to exclude with certainty a causal relationship to our drug candidate, even though the responsible clinical
investigator may view such an event as not study drug-related.    Any failure or significant delay in completing preclinical studies or
clinical trials for our drug candidates, or in receiving and maintaining regulatory approval for the sale of any resulting drugs, may significantly harm our business and negatively affect our stock price.  
   The failure of a number of Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating other compounds as potential treatments for patients with ALS may suggest
an increased risk that our planned Phase 3 clinical development program of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS will also fail.      The
FDA has not approved any drug for the treatment of ALS since its approval of riluzole in 1995. In recent years, a number of Phase 3 clinical trials of potential treatments for ALS have failed to demonstrate the requisite efficacy for approval or for
their continued development. These include Biogen s trial of dexpramipexole, known as EMPOWER, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke s trial of ceftriaxone, and Trophos SA s trial of olesoxime. Tirasemtiv, like
these compounds, may fail in Phase 3 clinical development if it does not show a statistically significant level of clinical efficacy or if the adverse event profile is too great compared to it benefits. Further, even if we believe the data collected
from our planned Phase 3 clinical development program of tirasemtiv are promising and should support approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not deem these data to be sufficient to support approval.

    We have never before conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial nor submitted an application for
marketing authorization to regulatory authorities, and may be unable to do so for tirasemtiv or any other drug candidates we are developing.    
 We are conducting VITALITY-ALS, a Phase 3 clinical trial, designed to assess the effects of tirasemtiv versus placebo on slow vital capacity
( SVC ) and other measure of respiratory function in patients with ALS. Conducting Phase 3 clinical trials and submitting a successful application for marketing authorization is complex, time consuming and expensive. We have not previously
conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial and have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting a marketing authorization. Consequently, we may be unable to effectively and efficiently execute and complete the trial in a manner that leads to
the submission to and approval by regulatory authorities of a marketing application for tirasemtiv. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of products that we
develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials, would prevent us from or delay us in commercializing tirasemtiv, and other product candidates we are developing.  
   Neither the FDA nor European regulatory authorities has accepted the primary endpoint in our Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with ALS
(a statistically significant reduction in the decline in SVC) as a sufficient measure of clinical significance alone to support regulatory approval of tirasemtiv for the treatment of ALS.    
 To commercialize tirasemtiv, we must first demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities that tirasemtiv is
sufficiently safe and effective. To date, neither the FDA nor European regulatory authorities has indicated that the primary end point that we have specified in our Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with ALS (change from baseline to 24 weeks in
SVC) is, in and of itself, a sufficient measure of clinical significance to establish the efficacy of tirasemtiv. Our Phase 3 clinical trial will also be measuring secondary endpoints of respiratory function and patient condition to provide further
evidence of the potential clinical significance of a treatment effect. However, there is no assurance as to which of these secondary endpoints (if any) will be affected even if treatment with tirasemtiv achieves the primary efficacy objective of the
trial. Further, there is no assurance as to whether regulatory authorities would accept the outcome of the trial as being a sufficient demonstration of clinical efficacy even if the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints are achieved. We will
continue interactions with regulatory authorities regarding the appropriate assessment(s) of the clinical meaningfulness and potential efficacy of therapy in the ALS population. If the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial in ALS are not sufficient
to persuade regulatory authorities of the safety and efficacy of tirasemtiv, either because of a failure to achieve pre-specified endpoints or because the authorities do not accept such endpoints as being sufficient, then we would be required to
conduct successfully one or more additional Phase 3 clinical trials, prior to receiving marketing authorization, which would be expensive, time consuming and uncertain.  
   It is not known whether the FDA or other regulatory authorities would accept a single Phase 3 clinical trial as being adequate to
support marketing approval of tirasemtiv, even if the results of such trial are positive.      The conventional standard for granting
marketing authorization of a new investigational medicine is the demonstration of safety and efficacy in two large, well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials. The Phase 3 trial of tirasemtiv in ALS that we are currently conducting will be the first
Phase 3 trial of this drug candidate. In the case of diseases with high unmet medical need, such as ALS, regulatory authorities may exercise their discretion to approve a new pharmaceutical on the basis of a single outcomes trial (sometimes subject
to the conduct of subsequent confirmatory trial(s)). However, this is always within the judgment of the regulatory authorities and is dependent on their assessment of the degree of success achieved in the clinical trial as balanced by the potential
risks associated with treatment. In addition, the design of the VITALITY-ALS Phase 3 clinical may not provide conclusive data on the most safe and effective dose of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS that meets the satisfaction of regulatory
authorities, thereby requiring us to conduct another Phase 3 trial. Even if our first Phase 3 trial of tirasemtiv shows positive results and provides all necessary data to determine appropriate dosing, regulatory authorities may nonetheless require
us to successfully conduct one or more additional Phase 3 clinical trials prior to receiving marketing authorization, which would be expensive, time consuming and uncertain.  
   Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and subject to delay.    
 Clinical trials are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements and are very expensive, difficult and time-consuming to design and implement.
The length of time and number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially based on the type, complexity, novelty, intended use of the drug candidate and safety concerns. We estimate that the clinical trials of our
current drug candidates will each continue for several more years. However, the clinical trials for all or any of our drug candidates may take significantly longer to complete. The commencement and completion of our or our partners  clinical
trials could be delayed or prevented by many factors, including, but not limited to:      

delays in obtaining, or inability to obtain, regulatory or other approvals to commence and conduct clinical trials in the manner we or our partners deem necessary for the appropriate and timely development of our drug
candidates and commercialization of any resulting drugs;        

delays in identifying and reaching agreement, or inability to identify and reach agreement, on acceptable terms, with prospective clinical trial sites and other entities involved in the conduct of our or our
partners  clinical trials;    
      Page 49  

Table of Contents  

delays or additional costs in developing, or inability to develop, appropriate formulations of our drug candidates for clinical trial use, including an appropriate modified release oral formulation for omecamtiv
mecarbil;        

slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, including as a result of competition for patients with other clinical trials; limited numbers of patients that meet the enrollment criteria;
patients , investigators  or trial sites  reluctance to agree to the requirements of a protocol; or the introduction of alternative therapies or drugs by others;    

for those drug candidates that are the subject of a strategic alliance, delays in reaching agreement with our partner as to appropriate development strategies;    

a regulatory authority may require changes to a protocol for a clinical trial that then may require approval from regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions where the trial is being conducted;    

an institutional review board ( IRB ) or its foreign equivalent may require changes to a protocol that then require approval from regulatory agencies and other IRBs and their foreign equivalents, or regulatory
authorities may require changes to a protocol that then require approval from the IRBs or their foreign equivalents;        

for clinical trials conducted in foreign countries, the time and resources required to identify, interpret and comply with foreign regulatory requirements or changes in those requirements, and political instability or
natural disasters occurring in those countries;        

lack of effectiveness of our drug candidates during clinical trials;        

unforeseen safety issues;        

inadequate supply, or delays in the manufacture or supply, of clinical trial materials;        

uncertain dosing issues;        

failure by us, our partners, or clinical research organizations, investigators or site personnel engaged by us or our partners to comply with good clinical practices and other applicable laws and regulations, including
those concerning informed consent;        

inability or unwillingness of investigators or their staffs to follow clinical protocols;        

failure by our clinical research organizations, clinical manufacturing organizations and other third parties supporting our or our partners  clinical trials to fulfill their obligations;    

inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;        

introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our drug candidates or their clinical trial endpoints obsolete; and    

results from non-clinical studies that may adversely impact the timing or further development of our drug candidates.    
 We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, or whether planned or currently ongoing clinical trials will need to be
restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant delays in clinical trials will impede our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and generate revenue and could significantly increase our development costs.  
   We depend on Amgen for the conduct and funding of the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil.    
 Under our strategic alliance, Amgen holds an exclusive worldwide license to our drug candidate omecamtiv mecarbil. As a result, Amgen is
responsible for the development and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure worldwide.  
      Page 50

  While we announced in September 2016 that Amgen was advancing omecamtiv mecarbil into
Phase 3 clinical development, we do not control the development activities being conducted or that may be conducted in the future by Amgen, including, but not limited to, the timing of initiation, termination or completion of clinical trials,
the analysis of data arising out of those clinical trials or the timing of release of data concerning those clinical trials, which may impact our ability to report on Amgen s results. Amgen may conduct these activities more slowly or in a
different manner than we would if we controlled the development of omecamtiv mecarbil. Amgen is responsible for filing future applications with the FDA and other regulatory authorities for approval of omecamtiv mecarbil and will be the owner of
marketing approvals issued by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for omecamtiv mecarbil, subject to Servier s exclusive rights for the commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe, as well as the CIS, including Russia. If the FDA or
other regulatory authorities approve omecamtiv mecarbil, Amgen will also be responsible for the marketing and sale of the resulting drug, subject to our right to co-promote omecamtiv mecarbil in North America if we exercise our option to co-fund
Phase 3 development costs of omecamtiv mecarbil under the collaboration and subject to Servier s exclusive rights for the commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe, as well as the CIS, including Russia. However, we cannot control
whether Amgen will devote sufficient attention and resources to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil or will proceed in an expeditious manner, even if we do exercise our option to co-fund the development of omecamtiv mecarbil. Even if the FDA or
other regulatory agencies approve omecamtiv mecarbil, Amgen or Servier may elect not to proceed with the commercialization of the resulting drug in one or more countries.  
 If the results of one or more clinical trials with omecamtiv mecarbil do not meet Amgen s expectations at any time, Amgen may elect to
terminate further development of omecamtiv mecarbil or certain of the potential clinical trials for omecamtiv mecarbil, even if the actual number of patients treated at that time is relatively small. In addition, Amgen generally has discretion to
elect whether to pursue or abandon the development of omecamtiv mecarbil and may terminate our strategic alliance for any reason upon six months prior notice. With our consent, Amgen granted Servier an option to commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in
Europe and the CIS, including Russia, which Servier decided to exercise. In August 2016, we entered into a letter agreement with Amgen and Servier, which provides that if Amgen s rights to omecamtiv mecarbil are terminated with respect to the
territory subject to Servier s sublicense, the sublicensed rights previously granted by Amgen to Servier with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the CIS, including Russia, will remain in effect and become a direct license or sublicense
of such rights by us to Servier, on substantially the same terms as those in the Option, License and Collaboration Agreement between Amgen and Servier. If Amgen abandons omecamtiv mecarbil, it would result in a delay in or could prevent us from
commercializing omecamtiv mecarbil, and would delay and could prevent us from obtaining revenues for this drug candidate. In addition, we would be required to provide Servier with a direct license or sublicense and the rights to commercialize
omecamtiv mecarbil in Europe and the CIS, including Russia on terms that were not negotiated by us. There can be no assurance that we would be able to negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement with Servier on terms favorable or acceptable to
us, or at all.    Disputes may arise between us and Amgen, which may delay or cause the termination of any omecamtiv mecarbil clinical
trials, result in significant litigation or cause Amgen to act in a manner that is not in our best interest. The costs associated with the continuing development of omecamtiv mecarbil may cause Amgen to reconsider the terms of its investment and
seek to amend or terminate our collaboration agreement or to suspend the development of omecamtiv mecarbil. If development of omecamtiv mecarbil does not progress for these or any other reasons, we would not receive further milestone payments or
royalties on product sales from Amgen with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil. If Amgen abandons development of omecamtiv mecarbil prior to regulatory approval or if it elects not to proceed with commercialization of the resulting drug following
regulatory approval, we would have to seek a new partner for development or commercialization, curtail or abandon that development or commercialization, or undertake and fund the development of omecamtiv mecarbil or commercialization of the
resulting drug ourselves. If we seek a new partner but are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, or do not have sufficient funds to conduct the development or commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil ourselves, we would have to curtail or
abandon that development or commercialization, which could harm our business.      We depend on Astellas for the conduct and funding of
the development and commercialization of CK-2127107.      In December 2014, we expanded our strategic alliance with Astellas focused
on the research, development and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators, other than tirasemtiv and certain related compounds. The primary objective of the strategic alliance is to advance novel therapies for indications associated with
muscle weakness.    Under this strategic alliance, we have granted Astellas an exclusive license to co-develop and commercialize CK-2127107
for potential application in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and potentially other indications worldwide. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with SMA and in June 2016, Astellas, in collaboration with us, initiated a
Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in patients with COPD.    In July 2016, we expanded our collaboration with Astellas and granted
Astellas an option to enter into a pre-negotiated agreement for a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of tirasemtiv, including worldwide commercialization rights for Astellas outside our commercialization territory in
North America, Europe and other select countries. In addition, under this 2016 expansion, we will collaborate with Astellas to develop CK-2127107 in ALS. Astellas will be primarily responsible for the development of CK-2127107 in ALS, and the
Company will conduct the Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in ALS.  
      Page 51

  We do not control the development activities that may be conducted by Astellas, including, but
not limited to, the timing of initiation, termination or completion of clinical trials, the analysis of data arising out of those clinical trials or the timing of release of data concerning those clinical trials, which may impact our ability to
report on Astellas  results. Astellas may conduct these activities more slowly or in a different manner than we would. In general, Astellas is responsible for filing future applications with the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval
of CK-2127107 and will be the owner of any marketing approvals issued by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for CK-2127107. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve CK-2127107, Astellas will also be responsible for the marketing and
sale of the resulting drug, subject to our right to co-promote the drug in the United States, Canada and, for neuromuscular indications, Europe. However, we cannot control whether Astellas will devote sufficient attention and resources to the
development of CK-2127107 or will proceed in an expeditious manner. Even if the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve CK-2127107, Astellas may elect not to proceed with the commercialization of the resulting drug in one or more countries.  
 If the results of one or more clinical trials with CK-2127107 do not meet Astellas  expectations at any time, Astellas may elect to
terminate further development of CK-2127107 or certain of the potential clinical trials for CK-2127107, even if the actual number of patients treated at that time is relatively small. In addition, Astellas generally has discretion to elect whether
to pursue or abandon the development of CK-2127107. Astellas may terminate our strategic alliance in whole or in part for any reason upon six months prior notice at any time following expiration of the strategic alliance s research term, which
will expire December 31, 2017. If Astellas abandons CK-2127107, it would result in a delay in or could prevent us from further developing or commercializing CK-2127107, and would delay and could prevent us from obtaining revenues for this drug
candidate. Disputes may arise between us and Astellas, which may delay or cause the termination of any CK-2127107 clinical trials, result in significant litigation or cause Astellas to act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If development
of CK-2127107 does not progress for these or any other reasons, we would not receive further milestone payments or royalties on product sales from Astellas with respect to CK-2127107. If Astellas abandons development of CK-2127107 prior to
regulatory approval or if it elects not to proceed with commercialization of the resulting drug following regulatory approval, we would have to seek a new partner for development or commercialization, curtail or abandon that development or
commercialization, or undertake and fund the development of CK-2127107 or commercialization of the resulting drug ourselves. If we seek a new partner but are unable to do so on acceptable terms, or at all, or do not have sufficient funds to conduct
the development or commercialization of CK-2127107 ourselves, we would have to curtail or abandon that development or commercialization, which could harm our business.  
   The successful development of CK-2127107 in ALS under our expanded collaboration with Astellas could reduce the commercial potential of
tirasemtiv, and our share of the costs of developing CK-2127107 in ALS could limit our ability to pay for other programs, including tirasemtiv.    
 Tirasemtiv is the lead drug candidate from our skeletal muscle contractility program. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical development program
for tirasemtiv, and started a Phase 3 clinical development program for tirasemtiv in patients with ALS in July 2015. In collaboration with Astellas, we are also developing CK-2127107 for potential indications associated with muscle weakness and, as
of July 2016 expanded our collaboration with Astellas to develop CK-2127107 in ALS. We expect that we and Astellas will commence a Phase 2 clinical development program of CK-2127107 in ALS in 2017.  
 Since we will be developing both tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 for ALS, if both drugs are successfully developed and commercialized, they would
potentially compete with one another in the same indication. If approved for commercial sale, the commercial launch of CK-2127107 following the commercial launch of tirasemtiv could negatively affect the sales of tirasemtiv. Successful development
of CK-2127107 in ALS, or CK-2127107 data that Astellas views as positive, may reduce the likelihood that Astellas will exercise its option to develop and commercialize tirasemtiv, in which case we would not receive any of the payments from Astellas
associated with the option exercise, and our ability to commercially launch tirasemtiv in markets outside of North America and Europe may be diminished.  
 In addition, we and Astellas will share equally the costs of developing CK-2127107 in ALS for potential registration and marketing
authorization in the U.S. and Europe, provided that (i) Astellas has agreed to solely fund Phase 2 development costs of CK-2127107 in ALS subject to a right to recoup our share of such costs plus a 100% premium by reducing future milestone and
royalty payments to the Company and (ii) we may defer (but not eliminate) a portion of our co-funding obligation for development activities after Phase 2 for up to 18 months, subject to certain conditions. We will, however, be required to fund
one half the cost of any Phase 3 development of CK-2127107 in ALS with limited ability to defer or offset such costs. Our one-half share of the costs of any Phase 3 clinical trial of CK-2127107 in ALS could be significant, and could negatively
impact our ability to finance other programs, including potentially limiting our ability to pay for the development and/or commercial launch of tirasemtiv.  
   If we do not enter into strategic alliances for our unpartnered drug candidates or research and development programs or fail to
successfully maintain our current or future strategic alliances, we may have to reduce, delay or discontinue our advancement of our drug candidates and programs or expand our research and development capabilities and increase our expenditures.
     Drug development is complicated and expensive. We currently have limited financial and operational resources to carry out drug
development. Our strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our drug candidates currently requires us to enter into and successfully maintain strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance
our programs and reduce our expenditures on each program. Accordingly, the success of our development activities depends in large part on our current and future strategic partners  performance, over which we have little or no control.  
      Page 52

  Our ability to commercialize drugs that we develop with our partners and that generate royalties
from product sales depends on our partners  abilities to assist us in establishing the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and achieving market acceptance of the drugs once commercialized.
Our partners may elect to delay or terminate development of one or more drug candidates, independently develop drugs that could compete with ours or fail to commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of drugs developed through
their strategic alliances with us. Our partners may not proceed with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates with the same degree of urgency as we would because of other priorities they face. In addition, new business
combinations or changes in a partner s business strategy may adversely affect its willingness or ability to carry out its obligations under a strategic alliance.  
 If we are not able to successfully maintain our existing strategic alliances or establish and successfully maintain additional strategic
alliances, we will have to limit the size or scope of, or delay or discontinue, one or more of our drug development programs or research programs, or undertake and fund these programs ourselves. Alternatively, if we elect to continue to conduct any
of these drug development programs or research programs on our own, we will need to expand our capability to conduct clinical development by bringing additional skills, technical expertise and resources into our organization. This would require
significant additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.      To the extent we elect to fund the
development of a drug candidate, such as tirasemtiv, CK-2127107, or omecamtiv mecarbil, or the commercialization of a drug at our expense, we will need substantial additional funding.    
 The discovery, development and commercialization of new drugs is costly. As a result, to the extent we elect to fund the development of a drug
candidate, such as tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 or omecamtiv mecarbil, or the commercialization of a drug, we will need to raise additional capital to:      

fund clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals;        

expand our development capabilities;        

engage third party manufacturers for such drug candidate or drug;        

build or access commercialization capabilities;        

implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;        

maintain, defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property; and        

hire and support additional management and scientific personnel.      Our future funding
requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:      

the rate of progress and costs of our or our partners  clinical trials and other research and development activities;        

the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals;        

the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities;        

the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;        

the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses, products and technologies;        

the effect of competing technological and market developments; and        

the status of, payment and other terms, and timing of any strategic alliance, licensing or other arrangements that we have entered into or may establish.    
 Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to continue to
finance our future cash needs primarily through strategic alliances, public or private equity offerings and debt financings. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure
additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or future commercialization initiatives.

    We depend on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials and have
limited control over their performance.      We have used and intend to continue to use contract research organizations
( CROs ) within and outside of the United States to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates, such as tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 and omecamtiv mecarbil, and related activities. We do not have control over many aspects of our CROs 
activities, and cannot fully control the amount, timing or quality of resources that they devote to our programs. CROs may not assign as high a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking these programs
ourselves. The activities conducted by our CROs therefore may not be completed on schedule or in a satisfactory manner. CROs may also give higher priority to relationships with our competitors and potential competitors than to their relationships
with us. Outside of the United States, we are particularly dependent on our CROs  expertise in communicating with clinical trial sites and regulatory authorities and ensuring that our clinical trials and related activities and regulatory
filings comply with applicable laws.    Our CROs  failure to carry out development activities on our behalf as agreed and in accordance
with our and the FDA s or other regulatory agencies  requirements and applicable U.S. and foreign laws, or our failure to properly coordinate and manage these activities, could increase the cost of our operations and delay or prevent the
development, approval and commercialization of our drug candidates. For example, in June 2013, we learned from our data management vendor for our BENEFIT-ALS clinical trial that a programming error in the electronic data capture system controlling
study drug assignment caused 58 patients initially randomized to and treated with tirasemtiv to receive placebo instead at a certain trial visit and for the remainder of the trial. In order to maintain the originally intended statistical power of
the trial, we amended the protocol to permit enrollment of approximately 680 patients, or 180 patients in addition to the 500 patients allowed under the existing protocol. This protocol amendment resulted in additional costs and delays in conducting
BENEFIT-ALS. In addition, if a CRO fails to perform as agreed, our ability to collect damages may be contractually limited. If we fail to effectively manage the CROs carrying out the development of our drug candidates or if our CROs fail to perform
as agreed, the commercialization of our drug candidates will be delayed or prevented.      We have no manufacturing capacity and depend
on our strategic partners and contract manufacturers to produce our clinical trial materials, including our drug candidates, and anticipate continued reliance on contract manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our potential
drugs.      We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. We have
limited experience in drug formulation and manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our drug candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Amgen has assumed responsibility to conduct these activities for
the ongoing development of omecamtiv mecarbil worldwide. Following our conduct of the early development of CK-2127107, including the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SMA, Astellas will assume primary responsibility to conduct the
manufacturing for the ongoing development of CK-2127107 worldwide. For tirasemtiv, we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers. In particular, we rely on single-source contract manufacturers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the
drug product supply for our clinical trials, as well as other materials required for the conduct of our clinical trials. We expect to rely on contract manufacturers to supply all future drug candidates for which we conduct development, as well as
other materials required for the conduct of our clinical trials. If any of our existing or future contract manufacturers fail to perform satisfactorily, it could delay development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of
our drugs, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenues. In addition, if a contract manufacturer fails to perform as agreed, our ability to collect damages may be contractually limited.  
 Our drug candidates require precise high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including
failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors or the frequent occurrence of such errors, could result in patient injury or death, discontinuance or delay of ongoing or planned clinical trials, delays or failures in
product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals and other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Contract drug manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality
assurance and shortages of qualified personnel. These manufacturers are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including the FDA s current good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign laws and standards. Each contract
manufacturer must pass a pre-approval inspection before we can obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates and following approval will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
and other regulatory agencies, to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign laws and standards. We seek to ensure that our contract manufacturers comply
fully with all applicable regulations, laws and standards. However, we do not have control over our contract manufacturers  compliance with these regulations, laws and standards. If one of our contract manufacturers fails to pass its
pre-approval inspection or maintain ongoing compliance at any time, the production of our drug candidates could be interrupted, resulting in delays or discontinuance of our clinical trials, additional costs and potentially lost revenues. In
addition, failure of any third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations, including pre-or post-approval inspections and the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies,
could result in sanctions being imposed on us. These sanctions could include fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delay, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license
revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business.

  In addition, our existing and future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not
remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store and distribute our drug candidates. If a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty occurs, we may be unable to replace these
contract manufacturers in a timely or cost-effective manner and the production of our drug candidates would be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs.  
 Switching manufacturers or manufacturing sites would be difficult and time-consuming because the number of potential manufacturers is limited.
In addition, before a drug from any replacement manufacturer or manufacturing site can be commercialized, the FDA and, in some cases, foreign regulatory agencies, must approve that site. These approvals would require regulatory testing and
compliance inspections. A new manufacturer or manufacturing site also would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our drugs and drug candidates. It may be difficult or impossible to transfer certain
elements of a manufacturing process to a new manufacturer or for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all, either of which would delay or prevent our ability to develop drug candidates and commercialize any
resulting drugs.      We may not be able to successfully scale-up manufacturing of our drug candidates in sufficient quality and
quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our drug candidates and commercializing resulting approved drugs, if any.    
 To date, our drug candidates have been manufactured in quantities adequate for preclinical studies and early through late-stage clinical
trials. In order to conduct larger scale clinical trials for a drug candidate and for commercialization of the resulting drug if that drug candidate is approved for sale, we will need to manufacture some drug candidates in larger quantities. We may
not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our drug candidates, whether in collaboration with third-party manufacturers or on our own, in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If a contract manufacturer makes
improvements in the manufacturing process for our drug candidates, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which
are costly and which regulatory authorities must review and approve. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a drug candidate itself or of a drug candidate in combination with
other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the finished product or active pharmaceutical ingredients. If we are unable to successfully scale-up manufacture of any of our drug candidates
in sufficient quality and quantity, the development of that drug candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting drugs may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply, which could significantly harm our business. In
addition, data demonstrating the stability of both drug substance and drug product using the commercial manufacturing process and at commercial scale are required for marketing applications. Failure to produce drug substance and drug products in a
timely manner and obtain stability data could result in delay of submission of marketing applications.      The mechanisms of action of
our drug candidates are unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any drug of commercial value.      We have
discovered and are currently developing drug candidates that have what we believe are novel mechanisms of action directed against cytoskeletal targets, and intend to continue to do so. Because no currently approved drugs appear to operate via the
same biochemical mechanisms as our compounds, we cannot be certain that our drug candidates will result in commercially viable drugs that safely and effectively treat the indications for which we intend to develop them. The results we have seen for
our compounds in preclinical models may not translate into similar results in humans, and results of early clinical trials in humans may not be predictive of the results of larger clinical trials that may later be conducted with our drug candidates.
Even if we are successful in developing and receiving regulatory approval for a drug candidate for the treatment of a particular disease, we cannot be certain that it will be accepted by prescribers or be reimbursed by insurers or that we will also
be able to develop and receive regulatory approval for that or other drug candidates for the treatment of other diseases. If we or our partners are unable to successfully develop and commercialize our drug candidates, our business will be materially
harmed.      Our success depends substantially upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection relating to our
drug candidates, compounds and research technologies.      We own, or hold exclusive licenses to, a number of U.S. and foreign patents
and patent applications directed to our drug candidates, compounds and research technologies. Our success depends on our ability to obtain patent protection both in the United States and in other countries for our drug candidates, their methods of
manufacture and use, and our technologies. Our ability to protect our drug candidates, compounds and technologies from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends substantially on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents. If our
issued patents and patent applications, if granted, do not adequately describe, enable or otherwise provide coverage of our technologies and drug candidates, including tirasemtiv, CK-2127107 and omecamtiv mecarbil, we or our licensees would not be
able to exclude others from developing or commercializing these drug candidates. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or
keep our competitive advantage.

  Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of
patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the claim scope of these patents, our ability to enforce our existing patents and to obtain and enforce patents that may issue from any pending or future patent applications is uncertain and involves
complex legal, scientific and factual questions. The standards which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and are subject to change. To date, no
consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Thus, we cannot be sure that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if
patents do issue, we cannot be sure that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by a court of law, will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or will afford us a commercial advantage over
competitive products. In particular:      

we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;    

we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications and issued patents;    

others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;    

some or all of our or our licensors  pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or the claims that issue may be narrow in scope and not provide us with competitive advantages;    

our and our licensors  issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs or therapies or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;    

our or our licensors  patent applications or patents may be subject to interference, opposition or similar administrative proceedings that may result in a reduction in their scope or their loss altogether;

we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or drug candidates that are patentable; or        

the patents of others may prevent us or our partners from discovering, developing or commercializing our drug candidates.    
 Patent protection is afforded on a country-by-country basis. Some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as in the United States. Many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. Some of our development efforts are performed in countries outside of
the United States through third party contractors. We may not be able to effectively monitor and assess intellectual property developed by these contractors. We therefore may not be able to effectively protect this intellectual property and could
lose potentially valuable intellectual property rights. In addition, the legal protection afforded to inventors and owners of intellectual property in countries outside of the United States may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as
in the United States. Therefore, we may be unable to acquire and protect intellectual property developed by these contractors to the same extent as if these development activities were being conducted in the United States. If we encounter
difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.  
 We rely on intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other
collaborators to grant us ownership of new intellectual property that is developed. These agreements may not result in the effective assignment to us of that intellectual property. As a result, our ownership of key intellectual property could be
compromised.    Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of
our intellectual property or our ability to obtain patents. For example, the America Invents Act of 2011 may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights in the United States or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by
us related to our patent rights in the United States.    If one or more products resulting from our drug candidates is approved for sale by
the FDA and we do not have adequate intellectual property protection for those products, competitors could duplicate them for approval and sale in the United States without repeating the extensive testing required of us or our partners to obtain FDA
approval. Regardless of any patent protection, under current law, an application for a generic version of a new chemical entity cannot be approved until at least five years after the FDA has approved the original product. When that period expires,
or if that period is altered, the FDA could approve a generic version of our product regardless of our patent protection. An applicant for a generic version of our product may only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that
its product is bioequivalent to our product, and may not have to repeat the lengthy and expensive clinical trials that we or our partners conducted to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective. In the absence of adequate patent protection
for our products in other countries, competitors may similarly be able to obtain regulatory approval in those countries of generic versions of our products.

  We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly where we believe patent
protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are often difficult to protect, especially outside of the United States. While we endeavor to use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or our partners 
employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, confidentiality agreements, if any, executed by those individuals may not be enforceable or
provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Pursuing a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets would be expensive and
time-consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Even if we are able to maintain our trade secrets as confidential, if our competitors independently develop information equivalent or similar to our trade secrets, our business could be harmed.
   If we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our technologies and drug candidates, then we will not be
able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing drugs, and we may not generate enough revenue from product sales to justify the cost of development of our drugs or to achieve or maintain profitability.  
   If we are sued for infringing third party intellectual property rights, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome
could have a significant adverse effect on our business.      Our ability to commercialize drugs depends on our ability to use,
manufacture and sell those drugs without infringing the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the therapeutic areas in which we
are developing drug candidates and seeking new potential drug candidates. In addition, because patent applications can take several years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which could later result in issued
patents that our activities with our drug candidates could infringe. There may also be existing patents, unknown to us, that our activities with our drug candidates could infringe.  
 Other future products of ours may be impacted by patents of companies engaged in competitive programs with significantly greater resources.
Further development of these products could be impacted by these patents and result in significant legal fees.    If a third party claims
that our actions infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of issues that could seriously harm our competitive position, including, but not limited to:  

infringement and other intellectual property claims that, even if meritless, can be costly and time-consuming to litigate, delay the regulatory approval process and divert management s attention from our core
business operations;        

substantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court determines that our drugs or technologies infringe a third party s patent or other proprietary rights;    

a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our drugs or technologies unless the holder licenses the patent or other proprietary rights to us, which it is not required to do; and    

if a license is available from a holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights.    
 If any of these events occur, it could significantly harm our business and negatively affect our stock price.  
   We may undertake infringement or other legal proceedings against third parties, causing us to spend substantial resources on litigation
and exposing our own intellectual property portfolio to challenge.      Third parties may infringe our patents. To prevent
infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to file infringement suits, which are expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is invalid, unenforceable, or both. In this case,
third parties may be able to use our technology without paying licensing fees or royalties. Even if the validity of our patents is upheld, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the ground that the other
party s activities are not covered by our patents. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may
not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, third parties may affirmatively challenge our rights to, or the scope or validity of, our patent rights.

    We may become involved in disputes with our strategic partners over intellectual property
ownership, and publications by our research collaborators and clinical investigators could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, either of which would have a significant impact on our business.
     Inventions discovered under our current or future strategic alliance agreements may become jointly owned by our strategic
partners and us in some cases, and the exclusive property of one of us in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes could arise regarding
ownership or use of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect or license rights to these inventions. In
addition, our research collaborators and clinical investigators generally have contractual rights to publish data arising from their work. Publications by our research collaborators and clinical investigators relating to our research and development
programs, either with or without our consent, could benefit our current or potential competitors, and may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which could significantly harm our business.  
   We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed trade secrets of their former employers.
     Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our
competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of
their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending these claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research
personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop and commercialize certain potential drugs, which could significantly harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could
result in substantial costs and distract management.      Our competitors may develop drugs that are less expensive, safer or more
effective than ours, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any drugs that we may commercialize.      We compete
with companies that have developed drugs or are developing drug candidates for cardiovascular diseases, diseases and conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting and other diseases for which our drug candidates may be useful treatments. For
example, if tirasemtiv is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the treatment of ALS, it may then compete with other potential new therapies for ALS that are currently being developed by companies such as Neuraltus
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is developing NP001; Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (in collaboration with Biogen, Inc.), which is developing Ionis-SOD1Rx; AB Science, which is developing masitinib; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, which is
developing Radicut (edaravone); Eisai Co. Ltd., which is developing mecobalamin; Orion Pharma (UK) Ltd., which is developing levosimendan; Genervon Biopharmaceuticals, LLC, which is developing GM604; Q Therapeutics, which is developing Q Cells;
Genentech, Inc., which is developing GCD-0134; MediciNova, Inc. which is developing ibudilast, Edison Pharma which is developing EPI-589, and VM BioPharm which is developing VM202. In addition, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics and Neuralstem, Inc.
are each conducting clinical development of stem cell therapies for the potential treatment of ALS. Tirasemtiv may also compete with Rilutek (riluzole), manufactured by Sanofi and several generics manufacturers including Apotex Corp., Glenmark
Generics, and Sun Pharmaceuticals.    If CK-2127107 is approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the potential treatment of
SMA, potential competitors include Roche (in collaboration with PTC Therapeutics and Trophos SA), AveXis, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (in collaboration with Biogen, Inc,), Novartis AG, and Bioblast Pharma, Ltd. Drugs that could
compete with CK-2127107 could also compete against tirasemtiv in ALS or other neuromuscular diseases, should the appropriate clinical trials be conducted. If CK-2127107 is approved by the FDA for the potential treatment of non-neuromuscular
indications associated with muscle weakness, potential competitors include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (in collaboration with Sanofi), which is developing SAR391786, a monoclonal antibody targeted to GDF8, for sarcopenia; Acceleron Pharma, which
is developing ACE-083 for diseases such as inclusion body myositis and certain forms of muscular dystrophy; Eli Lilly and Company, which is developing landogrozumab, a monoclonal antibody to myostatin, in muscle wasting after hip arthroplasty; vTv
Therapeutics, which is developing HPP593, a PPAR delta agonist, in muscle weakness; Summit Therapeutics, which is developing SMT-C1100, a utrophin stimulator, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Pfizer Inc., which is developing PF-06252616, a monoclonal
antibody targeted to myostatin, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and Novartis (in collaboration with Morphosys AG), is conducting clinical development with an activin type-IIB receptor antagonist, bimagrumab, to evaluate its ability to treat diseases
involving the loss of muscle mass, strength and function.

  If omecamtiv mecarbil is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for
the treatment of heart failure, it would compete against other drugs used for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. These include generic drugs, such as milrinone, dobutamine or digoxin and branded drugs such as Natrecor (nesiritide)
Procoralan/Corlanor (ivabradine), and Entresto. Omecamtiv mecarbil could also potentially compete against other novel drug candidates and therapies in development, such as bucindolol, which is being developed by ARCA biopharma, Inc.; Reasanz
(serelaxin), from Novartis; cenderitide (CD-NP), which is being developed by Carpicor Therapeutics, Inc.; ularitide, which is being developed by Cardiorentis Ltd.; aladorian, which is being developed by ARMGO Pharma, Inc; certain cardioprotectants
which are being developed by Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; glial growth factor (GGF-2) which is being developed by Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.; Neurocardin, which is being developed by Zensun Sci   Tech, Ltd; elamipretide, which is being
developed by Stealth Therapeutics, Inc.; ONO-4232, which is being developed by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; finerenone and vericiguat, which are being developed by Bayer, AG; and levosimendan, which was acquired for development by Oxygen
Biotherapeutics, Inc. In addition, there are a number of medical devices being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure.  
 Our competitors may:      

develop drug candidates and market drugs that are less expensive or more effective than our future drugs;        

commercialize competing drugs before we or our partners can launch any drugs developed from our drug candidates;        

hold or obtain proprietary rights that could prevent us from commercializing our products;        

initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;        

more successfully recruit skilled scientific workers and management from the limited pool of available talent;        

more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic alliances;        

take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can;        

develop drug candidates and market drugs that increase the levels of safety or efficacy that our drug candidates will need to show in order to obtain regulatory approval; or    

introduce therapies or market drugs that render the market opportunity for our potential drugs obsolete.    
 We will compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with
larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their partners, may develop new drug candidates
that will compete with ours. Many of these competitors have larger research and development programs or substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our competitors may also have significantly greater experience in:  

developing drug candidates;        

undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;        

building relationships with key customers and opinion-leading physicians;        

obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drug candidates;        

formulating and manufacturing drugs; and        

launching, marketing and selling drugs.      If our competitors market drugs that are less
expensive, safer or more efficacious than our potential drugs, or that reach the market sooner than our potential drugs, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the life sciences industry is characterized by rapid technological change.
If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by improving existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches,
potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies.

    We have been granted orphan designations in the U.S. and in the E.U. for tirasemtiv;
however, there can be no guarantee that we will receive orphan approval for tirasemtiv nor that we will be able to prevent third parties from developing and commercializing products that are competitive to tirasemtiv.    
 We have been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. by the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency,
in each case for tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS. In the U.S., upon approval from the FDA of an NDA, products granted orphan drug approval are generally provided with seven years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S., meaning the FDA
will generally not approve applications for other product candidates for the same orphan indication that contain the same active ingredient. Even if we are the first to obtain approval of an orphan product and are granted exclusivity in the U.S.,
there are limited circumstances under which a later competitor product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our product or
due to an inability to assure a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug.    Orphan medicinal product status in Europe Union can provide up to
10 years of marketing exclusivity, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the European Union. Although we may have drug
candidates that may obtain orphan drug exclusivity in Europe, the orphan approval and associated exclusivity period may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or approval criteria
after market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g ., product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more
effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug.    We are not guaranteed to maintain orphan status for tirasemtiv
or to receive orphan status for tirasemtiv for any other indication or for any of our other drug candidates for any indication. If our drug candidates that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the marketing
exclusivity provided for them in the U.S. or the European Union, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity
in the U.S. and the European Union for the time periods specified above, we would not be able to exclude other companies from manufacturing and/or selling products using the same active ingredient for the same indication beyond the exclusivity
period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that another company will not receive approval before we do of an orphan drug application in the U.S. or the European Union for a product candidate
that has the same active ingredient or is a similar medicinal product for the same indication as any of our drug candidates for which we plan to file for orphan designation and status. If that were to happen, our orphan drug applications for our
drug candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the European Union, as applicable. Further, application of the orphan drug regulations in the U.S. and Europe
is uncertain, and we cannot predict how the respective regulatory bodies will interpret and apply the regulations to our or our competitors  products.  
   Our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could impair our drug development and commercialization activities.    
 Our business depends on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel. The loss of the services of any
member of our senior management or key scientific or technical staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of drug development and other business objectives by diverting management s attention to transition matters and identifying
suitable replacements. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have
conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us. In addition, if and as our business grows, we will need to recruit additional executive
management and scientific and technical personnel. There is intense competition for skilled executives and employees with relevant scientific and technical expertise, and this competition is likely to continue. Our inability to attract and retain
sufficient scientific, technical and managerial personnel could limit or delay our product development activities, which would adversely affect the development of our drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs and growth of our
business.      Any future workforce and expense reductions may have an adverse impact on our internal programs and our ability to hire
and retain skilled personnel.      Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
personnel. In light of our continued need for funding and cost control, we may be required to implement future workforce and expense reductions, which could further limit our research and development activities. For example, in October 2011, we
reduced our workforce by approximately 18% in order to reduce expenses and to focus resources primarily on our later-stage development programs for tirasemtiv and omecamtiv mecarbil and certain other research and development programs also directed
to muscle biology. These headcount reductions and the cost control measures we have implemented may negatively affect our productivity and limit our research and development activities. We may have difficulty retaining and attracting such personnel
as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions. In addition, the implementation of any additional workforce or expense reduction programs may divert the efforts of our management team and other key employees, which could adversely
affect our business.

    We may expand our development and clinical research capabilities and, as a result, we may
encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.      We may have growth in our expenditures, the
number of our employees and the scope of our operations, in particular with respect to those drug candidates that we elect to develop or commercialize independently or together with a partner. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must
continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the
expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth
could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.      We currently have no sales or marketing capabilities
and, if we are unable to enter into or maintain strategic alliances with marketing partners or to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our potential drugs.    
 We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We plan to commercialize drugs that can be effectively marketed and sold
in concentrated markets that do not require a large sales force to be competitive. To achieve this goal, we will need to establish our own specialized sales force and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution
capabilities. Developing such an organization is expensive and time-consuming and could delay a product launch. In addition, we may not be able to develop this capacity efficiently, cost-effectively or at all, which could make us unable to
commercialize our drugs. If we determine not to market our drugs on our own, we will depend on strategic alliances with third parties, such as Amgen and Astellas, which have established distribution systems and direct sales forces to commercialize
them. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully commercialize these drugs. To the extent that we are not successful in commercializing any drugs ourselves or through a strategic
alliance, our product revenues and business will suffer and our stock price would decrease.      Our internal computer systems, or those
of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs.    
 Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are
vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an
event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing clinical studies for any of our drug
candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or
applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.  
   We are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. In the future, we may not
complete our execution of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial
statements and may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.      We are
required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  
 Complying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. We may not be able to complete our
internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to assert that our internal
controls are effective. For example, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2016, because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting
related to research and development expenses associated with the review of clinical trial expenses incurred under our clinical research organization trial agreements, including in part, our review of information received from third party service
providers that is used in the operation of this control. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or other material weaknesses are identified in the future or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely
manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated, we would receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm, and we could be subject to
investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, and the value of our common stock could decline. In addition, because we have concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting is not effective, and to the extent we identify future weaknesses or deficiencies, there could be material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. As a
result, our ability to obtain additional financing, or obtain additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and the
value of our common stock. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion or expresses an adverse
opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls in the future, investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports could be further eroded, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

   Risks Related To Our Industry   
   The regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent our partners or us from obtaining approvals to
commercialize some or all of our drug candidates.      The research, testing, manufacturing, selling and marketing of drugs are
subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor our partners are permitted to market our potential drugs in the
United States until we receive approval of a new drug application ( NDA ) from the FDA. Neither we nor our partners have received NDA or other marketing approval for any of our drug candidates.  
 Obtaining NDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable foreign and
U.S. regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. These include warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of
production, and refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.

Table of Contents  

  Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is never guaranteed, and the approval process
typically takes several years and is extremely expensive. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies also have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, and the guidance and advice issued by such agencies is subject to change at any time.
Despite the time and efforts exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we may encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical testing and clinical trials. The number and focus of
preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for approval by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the
regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. In addition, the FDA may require that a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, also known as a REMS, be submitted as part of an NDA if the FDA determines that it is necessary to
ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:  

they might determine that a drug candidate is not safe or effective;        

they might not find the data from nonclinical testing and clinical trials sufficient and could request that additional trials be performed;    

they might not approve our, our partner s or the contract manufacturer s processes or facilities; or        

they might change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.      Even if we receive
regulatory approval to manufacture and sell a drug in a particular regulatory jurisdiction, other jurisdictions  regulatory authorities may not approve that drug for manufacture and sale. If we or our partners fail to receive and maintain
regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates, it would significantly harm our business and negatively affect our stock price.  
   If we or our partners receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates, we or they will be subject to ongoing obligations to and
continued regulatory review by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and may be subject to additional post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit commercialization of our potential drugs.    
 Any regulatory approvals that we or our partners receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which
the drug may be marketed or require potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or compliance with a REMS. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies approves any of our drug candidates, the labeling, packaging, adverse event
reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug, including adverse events of unanticipated
severity or frequency, or the discovery that adverse events or toxicities observed in preclinical research or clinical trials that were believed to be minor actually constitute much more serious problems, may result in restrictions on the marketing
of the drug or withdrawal of the drug from the market.    The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may change their policies and additional
government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or
administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business would suffer.  
   If physicians and patients do not accept our drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.    
 Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, the resulting drugs, if any, may not gain market acceptance among physicians,
healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Even if the clinical safety and efficacy of drugs developed from our drug candidates are established for purposes of approval, physicians may elect not to recommend these drugs for a variety of
reasons including, but not limited to:      

introduction of competitive drugs to the market;        

clinical safety and efficacy of alternative drugs or treatments;        

cost-effectiveness;        

availability of coverage and reimbursement from health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors;        

convenience and ease of administration;        

prevalence and severity of adverse events;        

other potential disadvantages relative to alternative treatment methods; or        

insufficient marketing and distribution support.    
      Page 63  

Table of Contents  

  If our drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant
revenue and our business would suffer.      The coverage, reimbursement status and pricing of newly approved drugs is uncertain and
failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement could limit our ability to market any drugs we may develop and decrease our ability to generate revenue.    
 Even if one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale, the commercial success of our drugs in both domestic and international
markets will be substantially dependent on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for our drugs by the medical profession for use by their patients, which is highly uncertain. Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations
and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our drugs. They may not view
our drugs as cost-effective and reimbursement may not be available to consumers or may be insufficient to allow our drugs to be marketed on a competitive basis. If we are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our drugs, our
ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected. Likewise, current and future legislative or regulatory efforts to control or reduce healthcare costs or reform government healthcare programs, such as the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act
and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could result in lower prices or rejection of coverage and reimbursement for our potential drugs. Changes in coverage and reimbursement policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives
that limit or restrict reimbursement for any of our drug candidates that are approved could cause our potential future revenues to decline.  
   We may be subject to costly product liability or other liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.    
 The use of our drug candidates in clinical trials may result in adverse events. We cannot predict all the possible harms or adverse events
that may result from our clinical trials. We currently maintain limited product liability insurance. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a personal injury or other claim excluded from, or beyond the limit
of, our insurance coverage. Our insurance does not cover third parties  negligence or malpractice, and our clinical investigators and sites may have inadequate insurance or none at all. In addition, in order to conduct clinical trials or
otherwise carry out our business, we may have to contractually assume liabilities for which we may not be insured. If we are unable to look to our own or a third party s insurance to pay claims against us, we may have to pay any arising costs
and damages ourselves, which may be substantial.    In addition, if we commercially launch drugs based on our drug candidates, we will face
even greater exposure to product liability claims. This risk exists even with respect to those drugs that are approved for commercial sale by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies and manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities. We intend to
secure additional limited product liability insurance coverage for drugs that we commercialize, but may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, or at reasonable costs. Even if we are ultimately successful in
product liability litigation, the litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and may create adverse publicity, all of which would impair our ability to generate sales of the affected product and our other
potential drugs. Moreover, product recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the direction of the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, other governmental agencies or other companies having regulatory control for drug sales. Product recalls are
generally expensive and often have an adverse effect on the reputation of the drugs being recalled and of the drug s developer or manufacturer.  
 We may be required to indemnify third parties against damages and other liabilities arising out of our development, commercialization and
other business activities, which could be costly and time-consuming and distract management. If third parties that have agreed to indemnify us against damages and other liabilities arising from their activities do not fulfill their obligations, then
we may be held responsible for those damages and other liabilities.

    Our relationships with customers, healthcare providers, clinical trial sites and
professionals and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished
profits and future earnings.      Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation
and prescription of any drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other
healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, and may market, sell and distribute, our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under
applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following:      

The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to
induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has
been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and
healthcare laws and regulations.        

The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government,
claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government and qui tam relators have brought False Claims Act actions against
pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be submitted to the government. There is also a separate false claims provision imposing criminal penalties.    

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing
a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA
also imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

The federal Physician Sunshine Act requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the
Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered
recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. Payments made to physicians and research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law.

Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental
third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal
government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.    
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve
substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and
regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion
from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs would significantly impact our ability
to commercialize, sell or distribute any drug. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or
administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.  
      Page 65

  In addition, health care providers in the United States, including research institutions from
which we or our partners obtain patient information, are subject to privacy rules under HIPAA and state and local privacy laws. In the European Union, these entities are subject to the Directive 95/46-EC of the European Parliament on the protection
of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and individual European Union member states implementing additional legislation. Other countries have similar privacy legislation. We could face substantial penalties if we knowingly
receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider that has not satisfied the applicable privacy laws. In addition, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our
partners and may impose restrictions on the use and dissemination of individuals  health information and use of biological samples.  
   Responding to any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of the hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological
materials we use in our business could be time-consuming and costly.      Our research and development processes involve the
controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from
those materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our or third parties  use of
these materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production activities.  
   Our facilities in California are located near an earthquake fault, and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters, catastrophic
events or resource shortages could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results.      All of our facilities and our
important documents and records, such as hard and electronic copies of our laboratory books and records for our drug candidates and compounds and our electronic business records, are located in our corporate headquarters at a single location in
South San Francisco, California near active earthquake zones. If a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, a catastrophic event such as a disease pandemic or terrorist attack, or a localized extended outage of critical utilities or
transportation systems occurs, we could experience a significant business interruption. Our partners and other third parties on which we rely may also be subject to business interruptions from such events. In addition, California from time to time
has experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. Future shortages and conservation measures could disrupt our operations and cause expense, thus adversely affecting our business and financial results.  
  Risks Related To an Investment in Our Securities   
   We expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or at or above your
investment price.      The stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility, particularly with
respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks, which often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our
common stock include, but are not limited to:      

announcements concerning any of the clinical trials for our drug candidates, such as tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS, CK-2127107 for the potential treatment of SMA, COPD, ALS or other indications
associated with muscle weakness and omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure (including, but not limited to, the timing of initiation or completion of such trials and the results of such trials, and delays or discontinuations
of such trials, including delays resulting from slower than expected or suspended patient enrollment or discontinuations resulting from a failure to meet pre-defined clinical end points);    

announcements concerning our strategic alliance with Amgen or Astellas or future strategic alliances;        

failure or delays in entering additional drug candidates into clinical trials;        

failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;        

issuance of new or changed securities analysts  reports or recommendations;        

failure or delay in establishing new strategic alliances, or the terms of those alliances;        

market conditions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other healthcare-related sectors;        

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;        

developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;        

introduction of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;        

issues in manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our drug candidates or drugs;    
      Page 66  

Table of Contents  

market acceptance of our drugs;        

third-party healthcare coverage and reimbursement policies;        

FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;        

litigation or public concern about the safety of our drug candidates or drugs;        

additions or departures of key personnel;        

substantial sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders, whether or not related to our performance;        

automated trading activity by algorithmic and high-frequency trading programs; and        

volatility in the stock prices of other companies in our industry or in the stock market generally.    
 These and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or
prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted
securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert our management s
time and attention.      If the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent you and other
stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.    
 As of October 27, 2016, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially owned or controlled approximately 10.4% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding vested and unvested options, restricted stock units and warrants). Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a
group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant
corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of us, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading
price of our common stock due to investors  perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.      Volatility in the stock
prices of other companies may contribute to volatility in our stock price.      The stock market in general, and the NASDAQ stock
exchanges and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, there has been
particular volatility in the market prices of securities of early stage and clinical stage life sciences companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating
performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs,
potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources, and could harm our reputation and business.  
   Our common stock is thinly traded and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock.    
 There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on NASDAQ, or that the volume of trading will be
sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common stock is
limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common stock.  
   Our stockholders will experience substantial additional dilution if outstanding options or warrants are exercised for common stock.
     As of October 27, 2016, there were 4,302,388 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, having a weighted
average exercise price of $5.33 per share, 5,192,044 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options outstanding, having a weighted average exercise price of $9.26 per share. The exercise of outstanding options or warrants for
common stock would be substantially dilutive to the outstanding shares of common stock. Any dilution or potential dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the stock price of our
common stock.  
      Page 67

    Ownership changes may limit our ability to use our net operating losses and tax credits in
the future.      In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ( Section 382 ), a corporation that
undergoes an  ownership change  is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income. We have performed a Section 382 analysis as of September 30, 2016
and do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change since 2006. A portion of our existing net operating losses and tax credits are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Future changes in our stock
ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and result in additional limitations. We intend to continue to monitor public filings made by third parties with the SEC to assess
whether an ownership change under Section 382 has occurred. Our ability to accurately assess any such ownership change is limited by the timeliness and accuracy of these public filings.  
   Evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses, use of resources and continuing
uncertainty.      Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market LLC rules create uncertainty for public companies. We regularly evaluate and monitor developments with
respect to new and proposed laws, regulations and standards. We cannot accurately predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur in connection with complying with such laws, regulations and standards or the timing of these
costs. For example, compliance with the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has to date required us to commit significant resources to document and test the adequacy of our internal control over financial
reporting. We can provide no assurance as to conclusions of management or by our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. In addition, the SEC has
adopted regulations that require us to file corporate financial statement information in an interactive data format known as XBRL. We may incur significant costs and need to invest considerable resources to remain in compliance with these
regulations.    These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack
of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest the resources necessary to comply with evolving laws,
regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with
new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, due to ambiguities related to practice or otherwise, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, which could
be costly and time-consuming, and our reputation and business may be harmed.      We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.      We have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of
capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses. In addition, the terms of existing or any future debts may preclude us from paying these dividends.
