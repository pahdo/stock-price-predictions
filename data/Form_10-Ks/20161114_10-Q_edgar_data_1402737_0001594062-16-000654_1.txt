Note 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND 

HCi Viocare ("VICA" or the "Company") was incorporated on March 26, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The Company has not yet generated significant revenues from planned principal operations and is considered a start-up enterprise. The Company was formed to sell medical devices with an emphasis on portable medical devices designed for home treatments with the initial focus in the northern regions of China.  The Company s intent was to seek strategic relationships with medical device manufacturers both in China and North America with the aim to be their sales and distribution agent in Northern China and to assist Chinese medical device manufacturers on the development of the North American market. 

On September 10, 2013, the controlling shareholder of the Company sold his controlling interest in the shares of the Company and there was a change in the Board of Directors of the Company, effecting a change in control of the Company. The business of the Company remains in the field of medical devices and other opportunities related to their uses. We are currently engaged in the technology development and licensing of bioengineering innovations for the health, sports and wellness sectors, and we intend to be engaged in the operation of prosthetic and orthotic (P O) total rehabilitation clinics. 

On January 15, 2014, the Company incorporated two wholly-owned subsidiaries in Scotland, U.K., HCi Viocare Technologies Limited and HCi Viocare Clinics UK Limited. The Company intends to operate in Scotland under these two subsidiaries, one of which will undertake the development and marketing of technologies and the other which is a P O clinic, which will serve as the centre of reference and training for the company s further clinics. 

On February 12, 2014, through our wholly owned subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, the Company acquired an interest in a patented technology known as  Socket-Fit . SocketFit is a system that will help overcome technical and resource hurdles endemic to the prosthetic sector. The system has been designed with the aim of offering optimally fitted prosthetic sockets that will reduce the number of prostheses made for patients, resulting in a reduced number of visits by the patient to the prosthetic, and also assisting in the rehabilitation of amputees.  Socket-Fit is a digital system for assessing an amputee s residual limb and for the production of truly functional and comfortable prosthetic sockets. The technology takes account of the external and internal geometry of the amputee s stump, the biomechanical properties of each individual soft tissue layer and the boundary and loading conditions of a complete prosthesis to generate a virtual 3D model of the residual limb making it possible to produce an accurate, functional and comfortable prosthetic socket. By minimizing the time and cost of socket production and reducing the number of faulty sockets there will be a reduction in costs incurred by health services and insurance companies worldwide as well as benefits to the amputee. The Company intends to undertake and fund, through its U.K. subsidiary, a project to improve the nature of the data used in socket modeling software with a view to creating a system that will enable prosthetists to build a socket that evenly distributes weight, provides enhanced comfort, and can be marketed and used across the industry for improved socket creation. 

On February 19, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change the name of the Company to HCi Viocare effective March 21, 2014.  Effective March 21, 2014, in accordance with approval from FINRA, we changed our name from China Northern Medical Device, Inc. to HCi Viocare. Concurrently we commenced trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol  VICA . 

On April 16, 2014, through our wholly owned subsidiary HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, we acquired all rights and interest in and to the background Intellectual Property Rights ( IPR ) for a developing technology known as  Smart Insole .  The Smart Insole system is believed to be a state-of-the-art, pressure and shear (friction)-sensing insole that can wirelessly communicate with connected devices.  The insole has a number of applications, including the mitigation of diabetic foot complications, such as ulceration, infection and amputation, in clinical gait analysis and in sports, as a wearable device to help athletes optimize their performance and prevent injury. The sensing system is very low cost, compared to traditional pressure sensing technologies, in our opinion making such applications affordable to the consumer for the first time.

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND (continued) 

On June 9, 2014, the Company, through our wholly owned subsidiary, HCi Viocare Clinics, acquired W D Spence Prosthetics Limited (the  Clinic ). The Clinic is located in Glasgow, Scotland, and is a fully operational prosthetics and orthotics clinic. The acquisition of the Clinic is the first step to the Company s and HCi Viocare Clinics  intention to develop the first chain of prosthetics and orthotics (P O) and diabetic foot rehabilitation clinics in the European market, covering Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. 

On March 31, 2015 the Company s wholly owned subsidiary HCi Viocare Clinics and its subsidiary W D Spence Prosthetics Limited completed a merger with the resulting combined entity having the name HCi Viocare Clinics UK Limited. 

On July 8, 2015 the Company incorporated HCi Viocare Clinics (Hellas) S A in order to carry out operations for the P O clinic under development in Athens, Greece. 

On August 8, 2015 FINRA approved a seven (7) new for one (1) old forward split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common.  A Certificate of Change for the stock split was filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on August 7, 2015.  Consequently, our authorized share capital increased from 100,000,000 to 700,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding common stock increased accordingly, all with a par value of $0.0001.  Our preferred stock remained unchanged.  All share and per share figures contained herein reflect the impact of the forward split. 

Note 2 - GOING CONCERN 

The Company incurred net losses of $1,215,551 and $8,792,480 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and has a retained deficit of $31,368,599. In addition, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1,290,467 and a stockholders' deficit of $1,048,108 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company's existing stockholders. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company has relied heavily for its financing needs on its Chief Executive Officer and President as more fully disclosed in Note 10. 

Note 3 - CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER/OFFICER 

Our Chief Executive Officer owns beneficially and in the aggregate, the majority of the voting power of the Company. Accordingly, the Chief Executive Officer has the ability to control the approval of most corporate actions, including approving significant expenses, increasing the authorized capital stock and the dissolution, merger or sale of the Company's assets.

Note 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principals of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCi Viocare and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, HCi Viocare Clinics UK Limited and HCi Viocare Clinics (Hellas) S.A. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). They do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC. The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those audited financial statements included in Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results when ultimately realized could differ from these estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits in banks with maturities of three months or less, and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have original maturities of three months or less. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying value of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments. 

Foreign Currencies 

Functional and presentation currency  - Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company and its subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the  functional currency ). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Company s functional and presentation currency. 

Transactions and balances  - Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at quarter end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of operations.

Note 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Foreign Currencies (cont d) 

Subsidiaries  The results and financial position of all subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 

i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet; 

ii) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates; 

iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognized as other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. This generally occurs when prosthetic products are fitted to customers, both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred or services have been rendered and accepted, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. 

Inventory 

Inventories,  which consist principally of raw materials and parts,  are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method and are adjusted to actual cost quarterly based on a physical count. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.  Work-in-process inventory consists of materials, labor and a predetermined fixed rate of overhead which is valued based on established standards for the stage of completion of each custom order. We do not carry finished goods on hand. Material, labor and overhead costs are determined at the individual clinic level. Presently we only maintain very limited parts and raw materials inventory. 

Warranty  

We do not record warranty liabilities at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under the terms of the applicable limited warranty as all component parts are covered by our respective industry suppliers.  

Advertising Costs 

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place, whichever is earlier, in accordance with ASC 720-35. Advertising costs were immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Research and Development Costs 

The Company charges research and development costs to expense when incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 730,  Research and Development . Research and development costs were $279,658 and $5,194,925 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Related parties 

For the purposes of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party in making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Company and the party are subject to common control or common significant influence. Related parties may be individuals or other entities.

Note 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Stock-based compensation 

For stock-based compensation the Company follows the guidance codified in the Compensation   Stock Compensation Topic of FASB ASC ( ASC 718 ). The Company determines the value of stock issued at the date of grant. It also determines at the date of grant, the value of stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily determinable. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, "Income Taxes", which requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

The Company has retained deficit from operations. Because there is no certainty that we will realize taxable income in the future, the Company did not record any deferred tax benefit as a result of these losses. 

Income tax years for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are open to examination by the taxing authorities. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share 

The Company reports earnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.  FASB ASC 260 requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company had potentially dilutive securities outstanding (convertible debt and liabilities) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, however, since the Company reflected a net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents, if outstanding, would have been anti-dilutive. A separate computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is not presented. 

Comprehensive Income 

FASB ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. 

Segment Reporting 

FASB ASC 820  Segments Reporting  establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial statements. Our proposed business segments are expected to span more than one geographical area. Specifically, the Company intends to operate prosthetic and orthotic rehabilitation clinics with various European based locations, as well as a corporate development and technology center which will undertake ongoing research and marketing activities.

Note 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Fair Value of Measurements 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States define fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 

Level 1:  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2:  Input other than quoted market prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, and reasonably available. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. 

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions that the Company develops based on available information about what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. 

An asset or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a variety of factors. The Company uses judgment in determining fair value of assets and liabilities and Level 3 assets and liabilities involve greater judgment than Level 1 and Level 2 assets or liabilities. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Valuation Assumptions 

The Company accounts for share-based payments pursuant to ASC 718,  Stock Compensation  and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company s stock price and expected dividends.  

Stock compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the vesting period of the award.  

The following table presents the range of the weighted average fair value of options granted and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock option grants: 

a) 

Expected life : The expected term of options granted is determined using the  shortcut  method allowed by SAB No.107. Under this approach, the expected term is presumed to be immediately after the vesting date at the end of the contractual term of one (1) year. 

b) 

Risk-free interest rate : The rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options. 

c) 

Volatility:  The expected volatility of the Company s common stock is calculated by using the historical daily volatility of the Company s stock price calculated over a period of time representative of the expected life of the options. 

d) 

Dividend yield : The dividend yield rate is not considered in the model, as the Company has not established a dividend policy for the stock.

Note 13  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES: 

The Company has experienced losses since inception. As a result, it has incurred no Federal income tax. The Internal Revenue Code allows net operating losses (NOL's) to be carried forward and applied against future profits for a period of twenty years. The Greece Tax Code permits such carryforwards for a period of five years. The United Kingdom Tax Code permits such carryforwards indefinitely. The total of these NOL's at September 30, 2016 was $4,587,000 in the U.S., $1,237,000 in Greece and $166,000 in the U.K and at December 31, 2015 was $3,843,000 in the U.S., $800,840 in Greece and $453,700 in the U.K.

Note 13   PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES: (continued) 

The Company has no tax position at September 30, 2016 and 2015 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the period presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward may be unlikely as a result of its intended activities. 

The Company recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company will establish a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Tax years since inception to fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 have been filed and are still open for examination by the taxing authorities.

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of HCi Viocare for the period ended September 30, 2016 shall be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results of the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors, Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in our Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016 We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend,   may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We were incorporated on March 26, 2007 under the laws of Nevada. Our activities have been limited to developing our business plan.  The Company was formed to sell medical devices with an emphasis on portable medical devices designed for home treatments with the initial focus in the northern regions of China.  The Company s intent was to seek strategic relationships with medical device manufacturers both in China and North America with the aim to be their sales and distribution agent in Northern China and to assist Chinese medical device manufacturers on the development of the North American market. 

On September 10, 2013, the controlling shareholder of the Company sold his controlling interest in the shares of the Company and there was a change in the Board of Directors of the Company, effecting a change in control of the Company. The business of the Company remains in the field of medical devices and other opportunities related to their uses. We are currently engaged in the technology development and licensing of bioengineering innovations for the health, sports and wellness sectors, and we intend to be engaged in the operation of prosthetic and orthotic (P O) total rehabilitation clinics. 

On February 12, 2014, the Company, through our newly incorporated Scottish subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, entered into an acquisition agreement with Christos Kapatos, a director of both the Company and HCi Viocare Technologies ( Kapatos ), to acquire all rights and interest in and to a patented technology known as  Socket-Fit .  Socket-Fit is a system that will help overcome technical and resource hurdles endemic to the prosthetic sector. The system has been designed with the aim of offering optimally fitted prosthetic sockets that will reduce the number of prostheses made for patients, resulting in a reduced number of visits by the patient to the prosthetic, and also assisting in the rehabilitation of amputees.  Socket-Fit is a digital system for assessing an amputee s residual limb and for the production of truly functional and comfortable prosthetic sockets.    The technology takes account of the external and internal geometry of the amputee s stump, the biomechanical properties of each individual soft tissue layer and the boundary and loading conditions of a complete prosthesis to generate a virtual 3D model of the residual limb making it possible to produce an accurate, functional and comfortable prosthetic socket.   By minimizing the time and cost of socket production and reducing the number of faulty sockets there will be a reduction in costs incurred by health services and insurance companies worldwide as well as benefits to the amputee.    The Company intends through the acquisition of the background intellectual property rights ( IPR ) to undertake and fund, through its U.K. subsidiary, a project as defined in the Acquisition Agreement to improve the nature of the data used in socket modeling software with a view to creating a system that will enable prosthetists to build a socket that evenly distributes weight, provides enhanced comfort, and can be marketed and used across the industry for improved socket creation. 

HCi Viocare Technologies intends to fund any further development on the aforementioned innovative technology, as well as to complete the development of #additional technologies in P O and wearable devices which were acquired from Dr. Kapatos as part of the extended technology applications of the insole technology discussed below. The company is seeking to operate a technology licensing model, collaborating with Global leading companies in their respective fields, to develop innovative products and receive royalties once they are launched. It is intended that such collaboration and licensing agreements be entered into during 2015 and 2016, with some products launching during 2016. Socket-Fit, however will take a minimum of two years to get to market from the commencement of the research and development of the product. 

On February 19, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change the name of the Company to HCi Viocare effective March 21, 2014.    Effective March 21, 2014, in accordance with approval from FINRA, we changed our name from China Northern Medical Device, Inc. to HCi Viocare.   Concurrently we commenced trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol  VICA .    

On April 16, 2014, the Company, through our Scottish subsidiary, HCi Viocare Technologies Limited, entered into an acquisition agreement with Dr. Christos Kapatos, a director of both the Company and HCi Viocare Technologies ( Kapatos ), to acquire all rights and interest in and to the background IPR for a developing technology known as  Smart Insole .  Kapatos has conceived and been working on a low-cost Smart Insole system, believed to be a state-of-the-art, pressure and shear (friction)-sensing insole that can wirelessly communicate with connected devices. The insole has a number of applications, including the mitigation of diabetic foot complications, such as ulceration, infection and amputation, in clinical gait analysis and in sports, as a wearable device to help athletes optimize their performance and prevent injury. The sensing system is very low cost, compared to traditional pressure sensing technologies, in our opinion making such applications affordable to the consumer for the first time. 

As the Company has pursued relationships with leading sports and medical device companies, it has become clear that the Smart Insole sensing technology has even more applications, and the company now intends to also co-develop a smart mattress, to help prevent pressure ulcers, and a low-cost bicycle power meter. 

On June 9, 2014, the Company, through our Scottish subsidiary, HCi Viocare Clinics, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Mr. William Donald Spence, Miss Catriona Ann Spence, and Mrs. Eilidh Isabel Malcolm (together the  vendors ), to acquire 100% of the issued capital of W D Spence Prosthetics Limited (the  Clinic ). The Clinic is incorporated in Scotland under company number SC307652, having its registered office at 8 Tomcroy Terrace, Pitlochry, Perthshire, PH16 5JA, UK. The Clinic is a private company limited by shares, with no registered charges, and the total issued share capital amounts to 1,000 ordinary shares par value of  1 each. The vendors to the Share Purchase Agreement are the beneficial owners and registered holders of all (100%) the shares of the Clinic, with Mr. William Donald Spence holding 520 ordinary shares, and Miss Catriona Ann Spence and Mrs. Eilidh Isabel Malcolm each holding 240 ordinary shares. Mr. Spence is also the director of the Clinic, and Miss Malcolm is the secretary. The Clinic has no employees or subsidiaries, and is not a subsidiary of another company.

The Clinic is located in Glasgow, Scotland, and is a fully operational prosthetics clinic. The acquisition of the Clinic is the first step to the Company s and HCi Viocare Clinics  intention to develop the first chain of P O and diabetes clinics in the European market, covering Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. 

On July 25, 2014, the Company entered into another Loan Agreement with the Company s CEO, President and Director, Sotirios Leontaritis, (the  Lender ), whereby the Lender, in order to provide general working capital and to allow the Company to effectuate its business plan, agreed to provide the Company a loan facility of 300,000 Euros with an annual interest of 5%, and the Company agreed to repay the Facility within 5 years from the date of the loan agreement. If for any reason the Company fails to repay the loan facility on the due date, the Lender has the right to convert it into shares of the common stock of the Company at Three Cents in the lawful currency of the United States (USD $0.00429) per share. 

On December 10, 2014, the Company applied for three patents arising from the Company s development of the Smart Insole IPR, to protect the essential workings of the technology, as well as it being used in a wide range of applications. The patent applications were submitted to the UK Patent Office by the patent and trade mark attorney firm JA Kemp of London, UK, thereby cementing the filing date for future application of the patents to overseas territories.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Profit  - We have incurred losses since inception. We generated $463,350 in revenues from operations and $115,917 in cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $17,539 in revenue and $716,109 in costs of goods sold for the three month periods ended September 30, 2015.  The substantive increase in revenue is due to an increase to our customer base as a direct result of marketing efforts undertaken by the Company during fiscal 2016 which has established the clinic as a key P O service center in Glasgow. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $278,235, compared to $554,117 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses    Operating expenses totaling $(191,405) in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $ $ 745,522 in 2016 compared to $554,117 in operating expenses in 2015, a decrease of approximately over 100%.  The substantial decrease period over period is almost entirely attributable to the termination of certain consulting agreements during the period, where under the service provider agreed to waive accrued fees totaling $469,640 resulting in net income from consultancy fees in the period of $(383,993).  Further, there was a substantive decrease in both professional fees and office expenses during the most recent three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the fact that certain stock awards issued in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to in-house legal counsel and an administrative support assistant had no comparative charges during the most recently completed three-month period.  

Loss from Operations -  Due to the substantive increase in revenue and decrease in operating expenses and cancelation of fees payable under a terminated consulting contract we recorded income from operations totaling $538,838during the 3 rd  QTR 2016 as compared to an operating loss of  $552,687during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Other expenses   - during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded income from other expenses of $1,213 as  result of gains from foreign currency transactions as opposed to a loss from other income of $1,694 in the prior comparative period.  

Net Loss  - As a result of the substantial decrease in operating expenses during the current three month period and the substantive increase to gross profit, the Company recorded net income during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $539,946 compared to a net loss of $555,291 in the prior comparative period. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Profit  - We have incurred losses since inception. We generated $652,287 in revenues from operations and $195,286 in cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $54,748 in revenue and $29,399 in costs of goods sold for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  The substantive increase in revenue is due to an increase to our customer base as a direct result of marketing efforts undertaken by the Company during fiscal 2016 which has established the clinic as a key P O service center in Glasgow. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,684,028, compared to $6,634718 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating Expenses    Operating expenses decreased by $4,950,690 to $1,684,028 in 2016 compared to $6,634,718 in operating expenses in 2015, decrease of approximately 75%.  The substantial decrease in research and development by $4,915,267 from $5,194,925 (2015) to $279,658 (2016) is predominantly related to the issuance  of 7,000,000 shares of common stock to Kapatos valued at fair market value on issuance totaling $4,550,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. However, consultancy fees increased substantially from $148,817 (2015) to $411,791 in the current period, predominantly related to  the issuance of 700,000 shares as a result of various consulting agreement with third parties valued at $591,500, with no comparative expenses in the prior period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase to consultancy fees in the current nine-month period is net $469,640 in accruals which were reversed in the current period as a certain services agreement was terminated and fees accrued waived in full.  Further, there was a decrease in both professional fees and office expenses during the most recent three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the fact that certain stock awards issued in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to in-house legal counsel and an administrative support assistant had no comparative charges during the most recently completed nine-month period.  

Loss from Operations -  Due to the substantive increase in revenue and decrease in operating expenses, including a dramatic reduction to fees allocated to Research and Development, as well as the cancelation of fees payable under a terminated consulting contract we recorded a loss from operations of $1,227,027 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $6,609,369 in the prior comparative nine month period. 

Other expenses   - during nine months ended September 30, 2016, a substantive decrease to interest from $377,687(2015) to $4,016 (2016). During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a substantive loss on debt settlement of $1,804,704 was recorded, with no comparative amount in the same period in 2016.  

Net Loss  - As a result of the substantial decrease in operating expenses during the current nine-month period and the substantive increase to gross profit, the Company recorded a net loss during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 of $51,215,551 compared to a net loss of $8,792,480 in the prior comparative period. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

At September 30, 2016, we had $9,153 cash on hand and liabilities of $1,004,703 in accounts payable and accrued expenses (including amounts due to related parties) and $655,441 in advances from related parties as compared to cash on hand of $9,579, liabilities of $650,389 in accounts payable and accrued expenses (including amounts due to related parties), $649,420 in advances from related parties, liabilities for unissued shares of $249,040 and corporate taxes of $12,074 at December 31, 2015.  Accounts receivable increased substantially during the current nine months totaling $254,423 at September 30, 2016 compared to only $3,075 at December 31, 2015 as the Company s prosthetics and orthotics clinic in Glasgow has greatly increased its patient through-put.  Presently we rely on our President and director, as well as private placements from qualified investors to fund our general operating expenses.   All new loans and advances secured from officers sand directors during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been repaid in the current period. The Company has closed private placements in the amount of $709,527 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These amounts contribute to our ongoing operating expenses and obligations until such time as the Company can conclude a larger equity based financing, anticipated during the fiscal year 2016.  

The Company expects it will need to raise a total of $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 to fund its proposed operations for the next twelve to thirty-six months, including the planned expansion of its Viocare Clinics to add up to 5 additional site locations. It intends to fund operations by a combination of related party loans, debt financing and equity placements. The Company is seeking equity private placements from qualified investors with which to fund operations until such time as it can secure alternate financing arrangements.  The Company is also seeking joint venture partners for its various Insole technology applications as a further means to fund ongoing commercialization efforts. 

There can be no assurance that continued funding will be available on satisfactory terms.

GOING CONCERN 

The Company incurred net losses of $1,215,551and $8,792,480 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and has a retained deficit of $31,368,599. In addition, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1,290,467 and a stockholders' deficit of $1,048,108 at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company's existing stockholders. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

During the period September 2013 through September 30, 2016, the Company relied heavily for its financing needs on its CEO, President and director, Mr. Sotirios Leontaritis.  The Company is actively seeking alternative financing sources. 

NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING 

Costs associated with being a public company are much higher than those of a private company. HCi Viocare has chosen public registration before the business has developed a predictable cash flow. There are present registration expenses and future legal and accounting expenses, future reporting requirements to the SEC, future exchange listing requirements, and future investor relations costs that must be borne by a public company but not by a private company. These costs can be a burdensome expense which could adversely affect our financial survival. The ongoing regulatory costs, reporting requirements, and management details, which must be met when registering and maintaining a public company, may make the economic viability of HCi Viocare very doubtful.  In addition, the Company requires additional financing in order to continue to execute its business plan which includes the commercialization of one or more technologies, the ongoing operation of a P O clinic in Glasgow, the opening of a new clinic planned for 2016 in Athens, as well as other strategically placed P O clinics, as well as ongoing research and development to bring new technologies to market. 

In the past we have relied on advances from our president and private placements to cover our operating costs. There can be no assurance that our president will continue to fund the Company or that any other capital will be available if and when required from qualified investors.   Our need for capital may change dramatically if we acquire an interest in a business opportunity during that period. At present, we have no commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any business venture, however, we are currently looking at a number of business opportunities in the medical field. There can be no assurance that we will identify a business venture suitable for acquisition in the future. Further, we cannot assure that we will be successful in consummating any acquisition on favorable terms or that we will be able to profitably manage any business venture we acquire. Should we require additional capital, we may seek additional advances from officers, sell common stock or find other forms of debt financing. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, and revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements. 

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 4 of our financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016.  While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Company will rely on the information contained in this Questionnaire for the purposes of such determination.
