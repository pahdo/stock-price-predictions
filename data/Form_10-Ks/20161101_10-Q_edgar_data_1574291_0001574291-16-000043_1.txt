Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management's expectations as of the filing date of this report with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "likely," "predict," any variation thereof,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include plans, projections and estimates contained in   "Part I Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   ("MD A") herein.  Such forward-looking statements include (1) expectations regarding anticipated growth in the wireless industry, carriers' investments in their networks, tenant additions, customer consolidation or ownership changes, or demand for our sites, (2) expectations regarding non-renewals of tenant leases, (including the impact of our customers' decommissioning of the former Leap Wireless, MetroPCS and Clearwire networks (collectively, the "Acquired Networks")), (3) availability and adequacy of cash flows and liquidity for, or plans regarding, future discretionary investments including: capital expenditure limitations created as a result of being a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Crown Castle International Corp. ("CCIC" or "Crown Castle") and reliance on strategic decisions made by CCIC management that enable such discretionary investments, (4) potential benefits of our discretionary investments, (5) anticipated changes in our financial results, including future revenues, margins, and operating cash flows, (6) expectations regarding our capital structure and the credit markets, our availability and cost of capital, or our ability to service our debt and comply with debt covenants, (7) expectations for sustaining capital expenditures, and (8) expectations related to CCIC's ability to remain qualified as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and the advantages, benefits or impact of, or opportunities created by the inclusion of our assets and operations in CCIC's REIT.  
  Such forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions, risk factors described in   "Item 1A. Risk Factors"   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 Form 10-K") and other factors.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected.  As used herein, the term "including," and any variation thereof, means "including without limitation." The use of the word "or" herein is not exclusive.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of CC Holdings GS V LLC ("CCL") and its consolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Signal Operating Partnership, L.P. ("GSOP"), which is an indirect subsidiary of Crown Castle International Corp., a Delaware corporation ("CCIC" or "Crown Castle").  CCL is a Delaware limited liability company that is a holding company and an issuer of the Company's debt.  Intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated.  As used herein, the term "including," and any variation thereof means "including without limitation."  The use of the word "or" herein is not exclusive. 
  The information contained in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements is condensed from that which would appear in the annual consolidated financial statements; accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015  , and related notes thereto, included in the   2015   Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC.   
  The Company is organized specifically to own, lease and manage sites.  The Company's core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its sites via long-term contracts in various forms, including licenses, subleases and lease agreements.  The Company's sites are geographically dispersed throughout the United States ("U.S.").  Management services related to the Company's sites are performed by Crown Castle USA, Inc. ("CCUSA"), an affiliate of the Company, under the Management Agreement, as the Company has no employees.  
  Approximately   68%   of the Company's sites are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master lease or other agreements with Sprint ("Sprint Sites").  CCIC, through its subsidiaries (including the Company) has the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Sites from Sprint for approximately $  2.3 billion  .  CCIC has no obligation to exercise the purchase option.  
  CCIC operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company's assets and operations are part of the CCIC REIT.  See note   5  . 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the consolidated financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  , and the consolidated results of operations and the consolidated cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP").  The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the   2015   Form 10-K, other than certain recent accounting pronouncements described below. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums.  The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2016, and has applied the guidance retrospectively.  As a result, the Company reclassified $  12.9 million   of deferred financing costs as of   December 31, 2015   from "long-term prepaid rent and other assets, net" as a direct reduction of "debt."

  (Tabular dollars in thousands) 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.  The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases with a term greater than 12 months.  The accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from existing guidance.  This guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2019 and is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company expects this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and is currently evaluating the impact. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including accounts receivable.  The new guidance requires entities to estimate the expected credit loss over the life of certain financial instruments at initial recognition of the financial instrument. The guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The outstanding balance of the 2012 Secured Notes as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1.0 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively.  The   2012 Secured Notes originally consisted of    $500 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.381%   secured notes ("2.381% Secured Notes") due   December 2017   and   $1.0 billion   aggregate principal amount of   3.849%   secured notes ("3.849% Secured Notes") due   April 2023  .  In September 2016, CCIC issued   $700 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.25%   senior secured notes ("September 2016 Senior Notes").  CCIC used a portion of the net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes offering to repay in full the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes.  The Company recorded an equity contribution related to the repayment of the 2.381% Secured Notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (see note 4).   
  Interest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs 
  The components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs are as follows: 

Purchases and Redemptions of Debt 
  The following is a summary of the purchases and redemptions of debt during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .    

(a) 
    Exclusive of accrued interest. 
              (b) 
    Inclusive of   $1.8 million   related to the write off of deferred financing costs. 

4. 
    Related Party Transactions 
     Pursuant to the Management Agreement, CCUSA has agreed to employ, supervise, and pay at all times a sufficient number of capable employees as may be necessary to perform services in accordance with the operation standards defined in the Management Agreement. CCUSA currently acts as the Manager of the sites held by subsidiaries of CCIC.  The management fee is equal to 7.5% of the Company s Operating Revenues, as defined in the Management Agreement, which is based on the Company s reported revenues adjusted to exclude certain items including revenues related to the accounting for leases with fixed escalators.  The fee is compensation for those functions reasonably necessary to maintain, market, operate, manage and administer the sites, other than the operating expenses (which includes real estate and personal property taxes, ground lease and easement payments, and  
  
   7

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Unaudited 
  (Tabular dollars in thousands) 

insurance premiums).  Further, in connection with its role as Manager, CCUSA may make certain modifications to the Company's sites.  
  In addition, CCUSA may perform installation services on the Company's towers, for which the Company is not a party to any agreement and for which no operating results are reflected herein. 
  As part of the CCIC strategy to obtain long-term control of the land under its towers, affiliates of the Company have acquired rights to land interests under the Company's towers.  These affiliates then lease the land to the Company.  Under such circumstances, the Company's obligation typically continues with the same or similar economic terms as the lease agreement for the land that existed prior to an affiliate acquiring rights to such land.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   26%   of the Company's sites where the land under the tower is controlled by an affiliate.  Also, the Company receives rent revenue from affiliates for land controlled by the Company that affiliates have towers on. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a net equity contribution of   $313.8 million  , which was inclusive of (1) an equity contribution from CCIC of   $508.5 million   related to the repayment of the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes (see note 3) and (2) an equity distribution of   $194.7 million  , reflecting distributions to its member and ultimately other subsidiaries of CCIC.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an equity distribution of   $162.9 million  , reflecting distributions to its member and ultimately other subsidiaries of CCIC.  Cash on hand above the amount that is required by the Management Agreement has been, and is expected to continue to be, distributed to the Company's parent company.  

5. 
    Income Taxes 
     Effective January 1, 2014, CCIC commenced operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As a REIT, CCIC is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company's assets and operations are part of the CCIC REIT. 
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to CCIC's dividends paid deduction.   

6. 
    Fair Values 
     The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value.  The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative quotes (that are non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if applicable.  There were no changes since   December 31, 2015   in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair values.  The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments, along with the carrying amounts of the related assets and liabilities, are as follows: 

7. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits or proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters, and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In addition, CCIC, through its subsidiaries (including the Company) has the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Sites, which represent approximately   68%   of the Company's sites.  CCIC has no obligation to exercise the purchase option.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the response to Part I, Item 1 of this report and the the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes and   "Item 7."Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   ("MD A")     included in our   2015   Form 10-K. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Form 10-Q have the same meaning given to them in our   2015   Form 10-K.  Unless this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q indicates otherwise or the context requires, the terms "we," "our," "our company," "the company," or "us" as used herein refer to CC Holdings GS V LLC and its subsidiaries.  
  General Overview 
  We own, lease or manage sites that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.  The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year.   
  Business Fundamentals and Results  
  The following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
             
    Continued demand resulting from wireless network expansion and new entrants 
                
    We expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment on our wireless infrastructure. 
                
    We expect existing and potential new customer demand for our towers will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of wireless applications (including mobile entertainment, mobile internet usage, and machine-to-machine applications), (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including laptops, tablets, and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, or (6) the availability of additional spectrum. 
                
    Substantially all of our towers can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure (which may include extensions or structural reinforcement). 
                
    Wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks. 
                
    Organizational structure 
                
    CCIC operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, our assets and operations are part of the CCIC REIT. 
                
    Our subsidiaries (other than Crown Castle GS III Corp.) were organized specifically to own, lease, and manage certain shared wireless infrastructure, such as towers or other structures, and have no employees.   
                
    Management services, including those functions reasonably necessary to maintain, market, operate, manage or administer our sites, are performed by CCUSA.  The management fee is equal to 7.5% of our  Operating Revenues as defined in the Management Agreement. 
                
    Site rental revenues under long-term tenant leases with contractual escalations 
                
    Initial terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each. 
                
    The weighted-average remaining term (calculated by weighting the remaining term for each lease by the related site rental revenue) of approximately   six   years, exclusive of renewals at the tenants' option, currently representing approximately   $4.0 billion   of expected future cash inflows.  
                
    Revenues predominately from large wireless carriers 
                
    Approximately   88%   of our site rental revenues were derived from Sprint, AT T, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless.  
                
    Majority of land interests under our wireless infrastructure are under long-term control 
                
    Approximately   90%   of our site rental gross margin and approximately   50%   of our site rental gross margin is derived from sites that we own or control for greater than 10 and 20 years, respectively.  The aforementioned amounts include sites that reside on land interests that are owned, including fee interests and perpetual easements, which represent approximately one-sixth of our site rental gross margin. 
                
    Approximately   18%   of our site rental cost of operations represents ground lease payments to affiliates of ours.  Such affiliates acquired the rights to such land interests as a result of negotiated transactions with third parties in connection with a program established by CCIC to extend the rights to the land under its portfolio of towers. 
                
    Relatively fixed tower operating costs 
                
    Our operating costs tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation and are not typically influenced by tenant additions or non-renewals.  
                
    Minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements 
                
    Sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately   1%   of net revenues.

Fixed rate debt with no short-term maturities 
                
    Our debt consists of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.849% secured notes due 2023. See note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.   
                
    During September 2016, CCIC issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of September 2016 Senior Notes.  CCIC used a portion of the net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes offering to repay $500 million of our previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes.  See notes 3 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Significant cash flows from operations 
                
    Net cash provided by operating activities was   $253.2 million  . See   "Item 2. MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources." 
     Outlook Highlights 
    The following are certain highlights of our outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above. 

During 2016 and 2017, we also expect that the impact from tenant leasing will be offset by non-renewals of tenant leases, primarily from our customers' decommissioning of the Acquired Networks, at least in part. 

Results of Operations 
  The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and our   2015   Form 10-K. The following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts.  See   "Item 2. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"   herein and note   2   to our   2015   Form 10-K.

     Third Quarter   2016   and   2015    
  Site rental revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $152.5 million   compared to site rental revenues of   $152.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Site rental revenues were impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations and non-renewals of tenant leases.  Tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.  See also   "Item 2. MD A General Overview."    
  Site rental gross margins for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $105.3 million   compared to site rental gross margin of   $106.0 million   for the same period in   2015   due to the relatively fixed costs to operate our sites.  
  The management fee for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.4 million  , or   4%  , from the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , but remained approximately   7%   of total net revenues.  The management fee is equal to 7.5% of our Operating Revenues as defined in the Management Agreement. 
  Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.8 million  , or   2%  , from the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment primarily related to capital expenditures to accommodate new tenant additions. 
  During September 2016, CCIC issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% September 2016 Senior Notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all of the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes, which resulted in a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of   $10.3 million  . 
  Net income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16.9 million   compared to net income of   $28.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The decrease was due primarily to the aforementioned loss on retirement of long-term obligations recorded for the repayment of the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes. 

12 

First Nine Months   2016   and   2015    
  Site rental revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $4.5 million  , or   1%  , from the same period in the prior year.  This   increase   in site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: new tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations and non-renewals of tenant leases.  Tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.  See also    "Item 2. MD A General Overview"   herein.  
  Site rental gross margins for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $3.4 million  , or   1%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned   1%     increase   in site rental revenues and the relatively fixed costs to operate our sites.  
  The management fee for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $1.4 million  , or   4%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , but remained   7%   of total net revenues.  The management fee is equal to 7.5% of our Management Agreement Operating Revenues. 
  Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $2.3 million  , or   1%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment primarily related to capital expenditures to accommodate new tenant additions. 
  During September 2016, CCIC issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of September 2016 Senior Notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all of the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes which resulted in a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of   $10.3 million  . 
  Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $76.1 million   compared to net income of   $86.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was due primarily to the aforementioned loss on retirement of long-term obligations recorded for the repayment of the previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  General  . Our core business generates revenues under long-term leases (See   "Item 2. MD A General Overview")  , predominantly from the largest U.S. wireless carriers.  Historically, our net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded our capital expenditures.  For the foreseeable future, we expect to generate net cash provided by operating activities (exclusive of movements in working capital) that exceed our capital expenditures.  We seek to allocate the net cash generated from our business in a manner that we believe drives value for our member and ultimately CCIC. 
  From a cash management perspective, we currently distribute cash on hand above amounts required pursuant to the Management Agreement to our indirect parent, CCIC.  If any future event would occur that would leave us with a deficiency in our operating cash flow, while not required, CCIC may contribute cash back to us. 
  CCIC operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, our assets and operations are part of the CCIC REIT.  We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of CCIC's REIT status and NOLs.  
  Liquidity Position.   The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Over the next 12 months: 
             
    We expect that our net cash provided by operating activities should be sufficient to cover our expected capital expenditures. 
                
    We have no debt maturities. 
     See note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

Summary Cash Flow Information 

Operating Activities 
  The   increase   in net cash provided by operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   of   $13.0 million  , or   5%  , from the first   nine   months of   2015  , was due primarily to growth in cash revenues, including cash escalations that are subject to straight-line accounting and a benefit from other changes in working capital.  
  Investing Activities 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our capital expenditures include the following: 
             
    Site improvement capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing sites to accommodate new leasing and typically vary based on, among other factors: (1) the type of site, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the site, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards.  Our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by (1) sufficient potential to enhance CCIC's long-term stockholder value, (2) CCIC's availability and cost of capital and (3) CCIC's expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.  
                
    Sustaining capital expenditures consist of maintenance on our sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the site.   
     Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Financing Activities 
  The net cash flows used for financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes the impact from our continued practice of distributing excess cash to our member and ultimately other subsidiaries of CCIC. In September 2016, CCIC issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of September 2016 Senior Notes.  CCIC used a portion of the net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes offering to repay $500 million of our previously outstanding 2.381% Secured Notes.  We recorded an equity contribution related to the debt repayment of our 2.381% Secured Notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  See notes 3 and 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  2012 Secured Notes 
  See our   2015   Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2012 Secured Notes, debt restrictions, and disclosures about market risk.  There are no financial maintenance covenants in the 2012 Secured Notes.  We are currently not restricted in our ability to incur additional indebtedness or distribute cash to affiliates or issue dividends to our parent.

Accounting and Reporting Matters 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The critical accounting policies and estimates for   2016   are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment.  In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.  Our critical accounting policies and estimates as of December 31,   2015   are described in   "Item 7. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters"   and in note 2 in our   2015   Form 10-K.  The critical accounting policies and estimates for the first   nine   months of   2016   have not changed from the critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31,   2015  .  
  Accounting Pronouncements 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.    See note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.    See note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, including a discussion of the recently issued lease accounting standard.
