  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Knoll, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The consolidated balance sheet of the Company, as of   December 31, 2015  , was derived from the Company s audited consolidated balance sheet as of that date. All other condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein are unaudited and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to summarize fairly the financial position of the Company and the results of the Company s operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein. The guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently in the assessment phase of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 -   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)  . This ASU simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, which is consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. The new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis, and upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures necessary for a change in accounting principle. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company reclassified deferred financing fees of   $1.8 million   and   $2.3 million   from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 -   Inventory (Topic 330)  , which amends existing guidance for measuring inventories. This amendment will require the Company to measure inventories recorded using the first-in, first-out method at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This amendment does not change the methodology for measuring inventories recorded using the last-in, first-out method. This amendment will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . The amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position.

    KNOLL, INC. 
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  .  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this standard during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of the adoption of this standard, 
     excess tax benefits of less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   were recorded through income tax expense as discrete items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; 
     excess tax benefits were combined with current and deferred income taxes within operating cash flows adopted on a prospective basis; 
     the Company elected to change its policy from estimating forfeitures to recognizing forfeitures when they occur and as a result approximately   $0.1 million   of cumulative estimated forfeiture expense was recorded to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016; 
     cash paid by the Company when directly withholding shares to satisfy an employee's statutory tax obligations continued to be classified as a financing activity and are included within the purchase of common stock for treasury line item; and 
     there was no impact on prior periods due to adopting the guidance on a prospective basis. 
   
  NOTE 2. INVENTORIES 
  Information regarding the Company's inventories is as follows (in thousands): 

Inventory reserves for obsolescence and other estimated losses were $  9.9 million   and   $8.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and have been included in the amounts above. 
   
  NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provisions for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending   December 31, 2016   and   2015  , which includes items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company s effective tax rate was   34.9%   and   38.0%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was   34.7%   and   36.4%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a result of discrete items and a result of the geographic mix of pretax income and the varying effective tax rates in the countries and states in which the Company operates. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately   $1.5 million   and   $4.4 million  , respectively. These unrecognized tax benefit amounts would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid approximately   $3.2 million   of certain tax liabilities as a result of filing amended returns. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the tax years 2007 through 2015, and to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years 2009 through 2015. In addition, the Company is subject to state and local income tax examinations for the tax years 2007 through 2015.

NOTE 4. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
  Litigation 
  The Company is currently involved in matters of litigation, including environmental contingencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. Based upon information presently known, management is of the opinion that such litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
  Warranty 
  The Company provides for estimated product warranty expenses when related products are sold and are included within other current liabilities. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, primarily historical claims experience, future warranty claims may differ from the amounts provided. 
  Changes in the warranty reserve are as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 5. INDEBTEDNESS 
  The Company's long-term debt is summarized as follows (in thousands):

During nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company contributed   $8.0 million   and   $2.0 million   in discretionary contributions to the union and nonunion pension plans, respectively. 
   
  NOTE 8. COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share excludes the dilutive effect of common shares that could potentially be issued due to the exercise of stock options and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of shares and potential shares and units issued under the stock incentive plans.

  NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Financial Instruments 
  The carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 
  The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates its fair value, as it is variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates, and are classified as Level 2. 
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following table represents the assets and liabilities, measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement (in thousands): 

Pursuant to the agreement governing the acquisition of HOLLY HUNT , the Company may be required to make annual contingent purchase price payments. The payouts are based upon HOLLY HUNT  reaching an annual net sales target, for each year through 2016, and are paid out on or around February 20 of the following calendar year. The Company classifies this as a Level 3 measurement and is required to remeasure this liability at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of such contingent purchase price payments, totaling   $16.0 million  , was determined at the time of acquisition based upon net sales projections for HOLLY HUNT  for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Company paid   $5.0 million   of the remaining   $11.0 million   contingent purchase price in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of HOLLY HUNT  achieving the 2015 net sales projections. Excluding the initial recognition of the liability for the contingent purchase price payments and payments made to reduce the liability, any further changes in the fair value would be included within selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  There were no additional assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides an account of our financial performance and financial condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Forward-looking Statements 
  This Quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, principally in the sections entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  and  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  Statements and financial discussion and analysis contained in this Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future trends, plans, events, results of operations or financial condition, or state other information relating to us, based on our current beliefs as well as assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   may,   possible,   potential,   predict,   project,  or other similar words, phrases or expressions. This includes, without limitation, our statements and expectations regarding any current or future recovery in our industry and publicly announced plans for increased capital and investment spending to achieve our long-term revenue and profitability growth goals, and our expectations with respect to leverage. Although we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions, any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: the risks described in Item 1A and Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  ; changes in the financial stability of our clients or the overall economic environment, resulting in decreased corporate spending and service sector employment; changes in relationships with clients; the mix of products sold and of clients purchasing our products; the success of new technology initiatives; changes in business strategies and decisions; competition from our competitors; our ability to recruit and retain an experienced management team; changes in raw material and commodity prices and availability; restrictions on government spending resulting in fewer sales to the U.S. government, one of our largest customers; our debt restrictions on spending; our ability to protect our patents, copyrights and trademarks; our reliance on furniture dealers to produce sales; lawsuits arising from patents, copyrights and trademark infringements; violations of environmental laws and regulations; potential labor disruptions; adequacy of our insurance policies; the availability of future capital; the overall strength and stability of our dealers, suppliers, and customers; access to necessary capital; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; the success of our design and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system; and currency rate fluctuations. The factors identified above are believed to be important factors (but not necessarily all of the important factors) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material adverse effects on us. All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. Except as required under the Federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the SEC, we undertake no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
  Overview  
  We design, manufacture, market and sell high-end furnishings and accessories, textiles, fine leathers, and designer felt for the workplace and home. Our commitment to innovation and modern design has yielded a comprehensive portfolio of products and a brand recognized for high quality and a sophisticated image. Our products are targeted at the middle to upper end of the market and are sold primarily in North America and Europe through a direct sales force and a broad network of independent dealers, showrooms, retailers and websites. 
  During the last decade we have diversified our sources of revenue among our varying operating segments and we believe over the long run our diversification efforts and strategy will continue to result in a more profitable and less cyclical enterprise. At the same time, we have continued to focus on growing and improving the operating performance of our Office segment. Recent introductions of complementary products like adjustable tables, seating and ergonomic accessories have driven our recent growth in the Office business.  
  As the workplace continues to evolve and the traditional boundaries between residential and contract blur, we believe our unique combination of office furnishings, KnollStudio  design classics and lounge designs, Spinneybeck   |   FilzFelt architectural materials and our broad range of Edelman  Leather and KnollTextiles  coverings materials helps us both capture more of our clients' total spend, and improves our profitability. 
  
   13 

The changing balance between the allocation of office space between the individual and the group is creating opportunities outside the traditional workstation market. We are also seeing clients incrementally investing in more adjustable and high performance options. This can increase the average selling price of an individual space and, coupled with an increased focus on well-being, also creates opportunities to innovate with new types of products. 
  We continue to increase our footprint in the residential market through our strategy of showroom expansion, and use this foundation as a platform for growth. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, our HOLLY HUNT  division completed the acquisition of Vladimir Kagan Design Group, known for its elegant, mid-century and contemporary designs. HOLLY HUNT , together with residential opportunities domestically and internationally, gives us exposure to a sophisticated client le that is pleased to invest in the finest in modern design. 
  Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    

Net Sales 
  Net sales for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $292.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $28.5 million  , or   10.8%  , from sales of   $263.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in sales was largely due to a $25.0 million increase in our Office segment sales, where we experienced growth in our core office systems as well as in our recently introduced complementary products, such as adjustable tables and storage products. Our Studio segment sales also increased 6.5% from the same period in the prior year, due primarily to strong sales growth in Europe and KnollStudio.

Other expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily related to exchange losses that resulted from the revaluation of intercompany balances between our foreign entities. The gain in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was due to the settlement of an outstanding receivable with our Canadian subsidiary.

  Our effective tax rate was   34.7%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   36.4%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a result of a favorable income tax examination ruling received from a non-U.S. income tax jurisdiction and the geographic mix of pretax income and the varying effective tax rates in the countries and states in which we operate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows: 

We have historically funded our business through cash generated from operations, supplemented by debt borrowings. Available cash is primarily used for our working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of quarterly dividends, and the repurchase of shares. Our investment in capital expenditures shows our commitment to improving our operating efficiency, innovation and modernization, and includes leasehold improvements for our showrooms, new product tooling, manufacturing equipment and technology. 
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $95.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $38.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of   $93.2 million   from net income and various non-cash charges, as well as   $2.4 million   of cash from lower working capital. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , cash provided by operating activities consisted of   $69.4 million   from net income and various non-cash charges, partially offset by   $31.2   million of cash used to fund working capital requirements. Cash from working capital requirements improved in the nine months ending 2016 compared to the nine months ending 2015 due to greater cash collections from customers, lower accounts payable and lower cash outflow for inventory investments. 
  Cash used in investing activities was   $33.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the purchase of Vladimir Kagan Design Group as well as additional investments in capital expenditures. 
  Cash used in financing activities was   $55.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $24.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash used in financing activities was the result of a $27.0 million net repayment of our revolving credit facilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million net repayment from our revolving credit facilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, we made dividends payments of $21.9 million and $17.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in dividend payments was the result of increasing our quarterly dividends from $0.12 to $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  We use our credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs and, at times, make significant borrowings and repayments under the facility depending on our cash needs and availability. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there was approximately $195.0 million and $222.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility may be repaid at any time, but no later than May 2019. 
  Our credit facility requires that we comply with two financial covenants, consolidated leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement) and consolidated interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of our consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement) to our consolidated interest expense. Our consolidated leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.0 to 1, and our consolidated interest coverage ratio must be a minimum of 3.0 to 1. We are also required to comply with various other affirmative and negative covenants including, without limitation, covenants that prevent or restrict our ability to pay dividends, engage in certain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments or loans, incur future indebtedness, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, alter our capital structure or line of business, prepay subordinated indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and sell stock or assets. 
  
   19 

We are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.25. We believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund working capital needs, capital spending requirements, debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. However, because of the financial covenants mentioned above, our capacity under our credit facility could be reduced if our trailing twelve month consolidated EBITDA (as defined by our credit agreement) declines significantly. Future debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations, from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness, satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance, which is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. 
  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A  non-GAAP financial measure  is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). We present non-GAAP measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful to display ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our operating performance. Pursuant to applicable reporting requirements, the Company has provided reconciliations below of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
  The non-GAAP financial measures presented within this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are Last Twelve Months ( LTM ) Adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP measures are not indicators of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, in evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur adjustments similar to those in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing equal prominence of our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only as supplemental presentations.

The following table reconciles net earnings to adjusted EBITDA and computes our bank leverage calculations for the periods shown. The bank leverage calculation is in accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 20, 2014. 

(1) Outstanding debt levels include outstanding letters of credit and guarantee obligations. Excess cash over $15.0 million reduces outstanding debt per the terms of our credit facility, a copy of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21, 2014. 
  (2) Non-cash items include, but are not limited to, an intangible asset impairment charge, a pension settlement and other postretirement benefit curtailment, stock-based compensation expenses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange, and restructuring charges. 
  (3) Debt divided by LTM (Last Twelve Months) adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit facility. 
  Environmental Matters 
  Our past and present business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. As a result, we are involved from time-to-time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures by us, some of which may be material. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 ( CERCLA ) for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used. The remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these CERCLA sites are unknown. We may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to CERCLA sites. We reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange-traded contracts. As a result, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Actual results may differ from such estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our accounting policies and procedures.  A more detailed review of our critical accounting policies is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   21 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We provided a discussion of our market risk in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no substantive changes in our market risk described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K except for the items noted below. During the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements. Interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non-U.S. operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers. 
  We also have risk in our exposure to certain materials and transportation costs. Steel, leather, wood products and plastics are all used in our products. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we estimated that materials deflation was approximately $0.8 million and transportation deflation was less than $0.1 million. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we estimated that materials and transportation inflation were approximately $1.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively. We continue to work to offset price increases in raw materials and transportation through our global sourcing initiatives, cost improvements and price increases to our products. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in U.S. dollars. A change in interest rates will impact the interest costs incurred and cash paid on the variable rate debt. During both the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our weighted average interest rates were approximately   2.0%  . 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We manufacture our products in the United States, Canada and Italy, and sell our products primarily in those markets as well as in other European countries. Our foreign sales and certain expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Our production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Additionally, as our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Canadian dollar and the Euro. Approximately 11.7% and 11.2% of our revenues in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and 27.2% and 26.5% of our cost of goods sold in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in $3.8 million of translation losses and $8.7 million of translation gains for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.      We, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 30, 2016) ("Disclosure Controls"). Based upon the Disclosure Controls evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Disclosure Controls are effective in reaching a reasonable level of assurance that (i) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting.    There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On February 4, 2008, our board of directors expanded this previously authorized $50.0 million stock repurchase program by an additional $50.0 million. 
   
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
  (1) There is no limit on the number or value of shares that may be purchased by us under the Options Proceeds Program. Under our   $50.0 million   stock repurchase program, which was expanded by an additional $50.0 million in February 2008, we are only authorized to spend an aggregate of $100.0 million on stock repurchases. Amounts in this column represent the amounts that remain available under the $100.0 million stock repurchase program as of the end of the period indicated. There is no scheduled expiration date for the Option Proceeds Program or the $100.0 million stock repurchase program, but our Board of Directors may terminate either program in the future. 
  (2) In July 2016, 8,333 shares of outstanding restricted stock vested. Concurrently with the vesting, 3,912 shares were forfeited by the holders of the restricted shares to cover applicable taxes paid on the holders' behalf by the Company. 
  (3) These shares were purchased under the Options Proceeds Program.
