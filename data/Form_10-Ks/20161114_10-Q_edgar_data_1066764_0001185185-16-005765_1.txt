NOTE 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Spine Injury Solutions Inc. (the  Company ,  we  or  us ) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. We changed our name to Spine Injury Solutions Inc. on September 1, 2015.  We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quad Video Halo, Inc. which holds certain assets associated with our Quad Video Halo ( QVH ) business, and Gleric Holdings, LLC which holds certain intangible assets.

We are a technology, marketing, billing, and collection company facilitating diagnostic services for patients who have sustained spine injuries. In addition, we are developing QVH programs to assist surgeons and other healthcare providers with treatment documentation in specialized areas, such as spine injuries and regenerative medicine.  We deliver turnkey solutions to spine surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers who treat spine injuries.  Our goal is to become a leader in providing technology and monetizing services to spine and orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers.  By monetizing the providers  accounts receivable, patients are not unnecessarily delayed or prevented from obtaining needed treatment.   After a patient is billed for the procedures performed we oversee collection.

We currently are providing technology and/or collection services to five spine injury diagnostic centers in the United States, which are located in Houston, Texas; Odessa, Texas; Tyler, Texas; El Paso, Texas and Dallas, Texas. We are seeking additional funding for expansion by way of reasonable financing to accelerate future development.  In connection with this strategy, we plan to offer our technology to additional diagnostic centers in new market areas that are attractive under our business model, assuming adequate funds are available.

We own a patented device and process by which a video recording system is attached to a fluoroscopic x-ray machine, the  four camera technology,  which we believe can attract additional physicians and patients, and provide us with additional revenue streams with our new programs designed to assist in treatment documentation.  We have refined the technology, through research and development, resulting in a fully commercialized Quad Video Halo System 3.0.  Using this technology, diagnostic and treatment procedures are recorded from four separate video feeds that capture views from both inside and outside the body, and a video is made which is given to the patient s representative to verify the treatment received.   Additionally, we anticipate independent medical representatives will sell Quad Video Halo units to additional hospitals and clinics.

NOTE 2.  GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS

Since our inception in 1998, until commencement of our spine injury diagnostic operations in August, 2009, our expenses substantially exceeded our revenue, resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit from operations of $15,004,698 as of December 31, 2009.  Since that time, our accumulated deficit has increased $1,607,226 to $16,611,924 as of September 30, 2016. We plan to increase our operating expenses as we increase our service development, marketing efforts and brand building activities. We also plan to increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve our business plan. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan, as well as our ability to increase revenue from services and obtain additional capital from borrowing and selling securities, as needed, to fund our operations. There is no assurance that additional capital can be obtained or that it can be obtained on terms that are favorable to us and our existing stockholders.  Any expectation of future profitability is dependent upon our ability to expand and develop our healthcare services business, of which there can be no assurances.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 3.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following are summarized accounting policies considered to be critical by our management:

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. Nevertheless, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report as filed on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position with respect to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the results of our operations for the interim period ended September 30, 2016, have been included. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Quad Video Halo, Inc. and Gleric Holdings, LLC. All material intercompany balances of transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Accounting Method

Our financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the reported amounts of our financial position and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized in accordance with SEC staff accounting bulletin, Topic 13, Revenue Recognition, which specifies that only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured can revenue be recognized.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is obtained prior to services being rendered when the patient completes and signs the medical and financial paperwork.  Delivery of services is considered to have occurred when medical diagnostic services are provided to the patient.  The price and terms for the services are considered fixed and determinable at the time that the medical services are provided and are based upon the type and extent of the services rendered.  Our credit policy has been established based upon extensive experience by management in the industry and has been determined to ensure that collectability is reasonably assured.  Payment for services are primarily made to us by a third party and the credit policy includes terms of net 240 days for collections; however, collections occur upon settlement or judgment of cases (see Note 4).

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and notes payable as reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, approximates fair value.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.  We maintain cash and cash equivalents in banks which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on these deposits.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Intangible assets acquired are initially recognized at cost. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Intangibles with a finite life are amortized, ratably, based on the contractual terms of the associated agreements.

Goodwill recognized in a business combination is subjective and represents the value of the excess amount given to the acquired company above the estimated fair market value of the identifiable net assets on the acquisition date. Each year, during the fourth quarter, the goodwill amount is reviewed to determine if any impairment has occurred. Impairment occurs when the original amount of goodwill exceeds the value of the expected future net cash flows from the business acquired.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no impairment to the asset was determined to have occurred.

Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review and evaluate long-lived assets such as intangible assets, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. In performing our review for recoverability, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of such assets and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the related assets, an impairment loss is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of such assets over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no impairment of the long-lived assets was determined to have occurred.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Assets that expose us to credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable are from a diversified customer base and, therefore, we believe the concentration of credit risk is minimal. We evaluate the creditworthiness of customers before any services are provided.  We record a discount based on the nature of our business, collection trends, and an assessment of our ability to fully realize amounts billed for services.  Additionally, we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $663,439 and $503,477, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Stock Based Compensation

We account for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors and consultants, including employee stock options, based on estimated fair values.  Under authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), companies are required to estimate the fair value or calculated value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.  The value of awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  We use the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized compensation expense related to our stock options of $6,200 and $0, respectively. We also recognized compensation and consulting expense for issuances of our common stock in exchange for services of $79,300 and $136,233 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $9,800 and $37,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  Topic 740-10-25 defines the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as  more likely than not  (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent). Under ASC Topic 740-10-25, the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained.

We are subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters. In addition, when applicable, we will adjust tax expense to reflect our ongoing assessments of such matters which require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective rate as well as impact operating results.

Under ASC Topic 740-10-25, only the portion of the liability that is expected to be paid within one year is classified as a current liability. As a result, liabilities expected to be resolved without the payment of cash (e.g. resolution due to the expiration of the statute of limitations) or are not expected to be paid within one year are not classified as current. We record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized no estimated interest or penalties as income tax expense.

With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal or state income tax examinations for years before 2012.

Legal Costs and Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we incur costs to hire and retain external legal counsel to advise us on regulatory, litigation and other matters. We expense these costs as the related services are received.

If a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. If we have the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, we make a separate assessment of recoverability and reduce the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we recognized no estimated or contingent losses.

Net Loss per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share is presented in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share,  for all periods presented. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents from outstanding stock options, warrants and convertible debt have been excluded from the calculation of the diluted loss per share in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, because all such securities were anti-dilutive.  The net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This ASU is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions.  The provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 include a five-step process by which entities will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the payment to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The standard also will require enhanced disclosures, provide more comprehensive guidance for transactions such as service revenue and contract modifications, and enhance guidance for multiple-element arrangements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-14 which delayed the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year (effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017). Early adoption is permitted. We are currently reviewing the effect of ASU No. 2014-09 on our revenue recognition and have not yet determined the method with which we will adopt the standard in 2018. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  This new accounting guidance under ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , provides explicit guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a non-vesting condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The guidance will become effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting entity will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an entity s management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by entities today in the financial statement footnotes. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplified Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.  This ASU eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.  Subtopic 225-20 ,  Income statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items,  requires that an entity separately classify, present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments of ASU No. 2015-01 can be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-01 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. ASU No. 2015-02 focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB ASC and improves current GAAP by: (1) Placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain criteria are met; (2) Reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity; and (3) Changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or variable interest entities. ASU No. 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The amendments in ASU 2015-03 are intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. These amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases , which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability , which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under ASU No. 2016-02, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early application permitted. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounted for leases expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. Management is currently evaluating the future impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

NOTE 4.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

We recognize revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with SEC staff accounting bulletin, Topic 13,  Revenue Recognition , which requires persuasive evidence that a sales arrangement exists; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized. The patients are billed by the healthcare provider based on Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) codes for the medical procedure performed. CPT codes are numbers assigned to every task and service a medical practitioner may provide to a patient including medical, surgical and diagnostic services. CPT codes are developed, maintained and copyrighted by the American Medical Association. Patients are billed at the normal billing amount, based on national averages, for a particular CPT code procedure.

Revenue and corresponding accounts receivable are recognized by reference to  net revenue  and  accounts receivable, net  which is defined as gross amounts billed using CPT codes less account discounts that are expected to result when individual cases are ultimately settled.  While we do collect 100% of the accounts on some patients, our historical collection rate is used to calculate the carrying balance of the accounts receivable and the estimated revenue to be recorded.   A discount rate of 48%, based on payment history, was used to reduce revenue to 52% of CPT code billings ( gross revenue ) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The discount rate was 52% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which reduced revenue to 48% of gross revenue.

The patients who receive medical services at the diagnostic centers are typically patients involved in auto accidents or work injuries. The patient completes and signs medical and financial paperwork, which includes an acknowledgement of the patient s responsibility of payment for the services provided. Additionally, the paperwork should include an assignment of benefits.  The timing of collection of receivables varies depending on patient sources of payment. Historical experience, through 2015, demonstrated that the collection period for individual cases may extend for two years or more. Accordingly, we have classified receivables as current or long term based on our experience, which indicates that as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that 30% and 25%, respectively, of cases will be collected within one year of a medical procedure.    

NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate 300,000 shares of common stock, valued at $0.30 per share, in connection with a financing agreement with a director of the Company for his assistance in obtaining a line of credit. The 300,000 shares issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes 100,000 shares that vested during the fourth quarter of 2015. Accordingly, the associated expense of $30,000 was expensed during 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed the remaining $60,000 related to the financing agreement pursuant to the agreement s vesting schedule, which is included in operating, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no issuances of stock related to this agreement.

NOTE 7.  NOTES PAYABLE

On August 29, 2012, we issued Peter Dalrymple, a director of the Company, a $1,000,000 three-year secured promissory note bearing interest at 12% per year. This promissory note is secured by $3,000,000 in gross accounts receivable. On the maturity date, one balloon payment of the entire outstanding principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest is due. On August 20, 2014, in connection with a financing agreement with Mr. Dalrymple, the promissory note was amended to extend the term by one year to mature on August 29, 2016 and the interest rate was reduced to 6%. To date, a total of $750,000 of advances under the line of credit with Wells Fargo (as described below) has been used as payment on the promissory note. In August 2016, the note was amended to extend the maturity date to August 29, 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, the note has a principal balance of $250,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded interest expense of $21,250 and $22,500, respectively, related to the note.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or of the entire year ending December 31, 2016.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 as included in our previously filed report on Form 10-K.

Comparison of the three month period ended September 30, 2016 with the three month period ended September 30, 2015.

We recorded $782,276 in gross revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, offset by $323,318 of the expected settlement discount resulting in net revenue of $458,958.  For the same period in 2015, gross revenue was $1,110,533, offset by $597,770 of the expected settlement discount, resulting in net revenue of $512,763.  We ceased providing collection services to the San Antonio diagnostic center during the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly had no revenue in San Antonio for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same quarter in 2015.  This is the primary reason for the above decline in gross revenue between those two periods.  Net revenue as a percentage of gross revenue increased to 58.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 46.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a higher collection percentage in the 2016 quarter. We are currently providing technology and funding services to five spine injury diagnostic centers in the United States, which are located in Houston, Texas; Odessa, Texas; Tyler, Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Dallas, Texas.

Service cost was $146,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $221,557 for the same period in 2015.  The decrease is due mainly to lower volume.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $459,126 of operating, general and administrative expenses compared with the $409,532 for the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to increases in (i) travel costs of approximately $19,000, (ii) marketing costs of approximately $29,000, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3,000, (iv) payroll and benefit costs of approximately $10,000, (v) legal expenses of approximately $3,000 and (vi) office and operating expenses of $9,000, coupled with a decreases of (i) approximately $18,000 in consulting costs, and (ii) approximately $5,000 in subscriptions costs  . 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $18,862 of research and development expenses compared with $89,512 for the same period in 2015.  The decrease is attributable to costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for engineering and testing fees to verify the Quad Video Halo ( QVH ) meets certain standards. Our patented (Patent No. 9,084,577) technology meets UL compliance with specific immunity and emissions standards required by IEC 60601-1-2-2007.    

As a result of the aforementioned, we had a net loss of $178,401 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $219,674 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Comparison of the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 with the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.

We recorded $2,837,823 in gross revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, offset by $1,176,817 of the expected settlement discount resulting in net revenue of $1,661,006.  For the same period in 2015, gross revenue was $3,070,903, offset by $1,573,669 of the settlement discount, resulting in net revenue of $1,497,234.  We ceased providing collection services to the San Antonio diagnostic center during the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly had no revenue in San Antonio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015.  This loss of revenue was partially offset by our sale of a Quad Video Halo unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net revenue as a percentage of gross revenue increased to 58.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 48.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to a higher collection percentage in the 2016 period.

Service cost was $559,413 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $635,064 for the same period in 2015. The decrease in service cost is attributable to the higher case volume in 2015.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $1,240,058 of operating, general and administrative expenses compared with the $1,370,781 for the same period in 2015.  The decrease is attributable to decreases in (i) consulting costs of approximately $100,000, (ii) legal fees of approximately $17,000, (iii) marketing expense of approximately $14,000 and (iv) travel expenses of approximately $9,000, coupled with increases of approximately $8,000 in insurance costs and approximately $1,000 of other net general and administrative expenses.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $38,709 of research and development expenses compared with the $265,510 for the same period in 2015.  The decrease is attributable to costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for engineering and testing fees to verify the QVH meets certain standards.  Our patented (Patent No. 9,084,577) technology meets UL compliance with specific immunity and emissions standards required by IEC 60601-1-2-2007.    

As a result of the aforementioned, we had a net loss of $217,229 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $815,724 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided in operations was $26,492, which primarily included a net loss of $217,229, an increase in inventories of $88,053, an increase in prepaid expenses  of $9,250, a decrease in accounts receivable of $61,093, a decrease in accounts payable of $18,303, and an increase in related party payables of $13,427,   offset by non-cash expenses, including bad debt expense, stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaling $284,807. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operations was $395,537, which primarily included a net loss of $815,724, an increase in inventories of $61,816, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $14,590, a decrease in accounts receivable of $168,302, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $48,923, and an increase in related party payables of $13,918, offset by non-cash expenses, including bad debt expense, stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaling $334,116. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no cash flows related to investing activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was $13,025, which was used for the purchase of equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in financing activities was $70,000 which included repayments on notes payable and long-term debt of $250,000, partially offset by amounts borrowed from the line of credit totaling $180,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 cash provided by financing activities was $250,000, which included amounts borrowed from the line of credit totaling $600,000, partially offset by repayments on notes payable and long-term debt of $350,000.

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we collected $575,133 and $556,275 in settlements, respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we collected $1,659,599 and $1,669,830 in settlements, respectively.

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. Such officers have concluded (based upon their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report) that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this report is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have also indicated that, upon evaluation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or other factors during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, one should carefully consider the discussion of various risks and uncertainties contained in Part I, Item 1A,   Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
