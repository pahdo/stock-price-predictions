3. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
  Basic earnings (loss) per common share was calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per common share was calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year plus the effect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock unit awards.  Weighted average number of common shares outstanding was calculated by using the sum of the shares determined on a daily basis divided by the number of days in the period.  The table below reconciles the Company s earnings per share (in thousands, except for per share data):  

(1) 
    Due to a net loss, the Company excluded from the calculation of loss per share the effect of equity awards representing the rights to acquire   988   and   974   shares of common stock for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company had   317   and   326   anti-dilutive stock options, respectively. Stock options are anti-dilutive when the exercise price of the options is greater than the average market price of the common stock for the period or when the results from operations are a net loss. 
              (2) 
    For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the 2019 convertible senior notes were not dilutive, as the average price of the Company s stock was less than the effective conversion price of such notes. It is the Company's stated intention to redeem the principal amount of its 2019 convertible senior notes in cash and the Company has used the treasury method for determining potential dilution in the diluted earnings per share computation. 
              (3) 
    Dilutive unvested restricted stock units are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the Company s performance compared to a predetermined set of performance criteria. See Note   6   to these financial statements for further information regarding certain of the Company s restricted stock grants. 

4  . Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Asset Impairment Assessment 
    
  In accordance with ASC 360, the Company periodically reviews long-lived asset valuations when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable.  If indicators of impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset group over their remaining estimated useful lives.  If the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows or appraised values attributable to the assets.  The future cash flows are subjective and are based on the Company s current assumptions regarding future dayrates, utilization, operating expense, G A expense and recertification costs that could differ from actual results.   
    
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company determined that it observed indicators of impairment related to its vessels.  This resulted from the rapid deterioration of its second quarter   2016   operating results, as well as the uncertainty regarding future market conditions and the related impact on the Company's projected operating results.  For the purposes of calculating the undiscounted cash flows, the Company groups its vessels into two groups, OSVs and MPSVs, and used a probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow projection to test for recoverability.  After reviewing the results of this calculation, the Company determined that each of its asset groups has sufficient projected undiscounted cash flows to recover

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the remaining book value of the Company's long-lived assets within such group.  During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company reviewed the assumptions used in preparing the undiscounted cash flow projections and it concluded that such assumptions remain consistent with current market conditions.  In addition, the Company has not observed any additional indicators of impairment related to its vessels during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .    
    
  Vessel Sales 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of its last remaining non-core conventional OSV, the   Cape Breton  , for cash consideration of   $420,000  . The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately   $45,000   (  $31,000   after-tax or   $0.00   per diluted share).  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company sold vessel-related equipment for cash consideration of   $0.1 million  .  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $81,000   (  $53,000   after-tax or   $0.00   per diluted share). 
    
  On February 27, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of   three   250EDF class OSVs, the   HOS Arrowhead  , the   HOS Eagleview   and the   HOS Westwind  , which were previously chartered to the U.S. Navy, for cash consideration of   $114.0 million  .  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $33.1 million   (  $20.7 million   after-tax or   $0.57   per diluted share).  On August 28, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of the   HOS Black Powder   for cash consideration of   $38.0 million  . The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $11.0 million   (  $6.7 million   after-tax or   $0.19   per diluted share). These vessels are now managed by the Company for the U.S. Navy.

Revolving Credit Facility 
  On   July 29, 2016  , the Company amended its existing revolving credit facility. The amended facility provides continued access to a reduced level of standby liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, newbuild and conversion programs and other capital expenditures.  The changes to the Company s revolving credit facility were effective July 29, 2016, and commenced with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016.  The more significant changes to the facility are noted below:  
              
    increase the unused commitment fee to 50 basis points for all pricing levels; 
                
    increase the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, spreads on funded borrowings by 25 basis points for all pricing levels; 
                
    increase the minimum collateral-to-loan value ratio from   150%   of the borrowing base to   200%   of the borrowing base, which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged from   $450.0 million   to   $400.0 million  ; 
                
    delay the previously scheduled step-down in the total debt-to-capitalization ratio, as defined, from   55%   to   50%   by   six   quarters to commence with the fiscal quarter ending September 30,   2018  ;  
                 
    allow the Company the option of making a one-time election to suspend the interest coverage ratio for a holiday period of no more than   four   quarters, ending no later than December 31,   2017  , with a single permitted rescission.  If the Company elects to exercise the interest coverage holiday, then the borrowing base will be capped at   $75.0 million   during the holiday and the LIBOR spreads for funded borrowings will be increased by an additional 50 basis points during and after the interest coverage holiday; 
                
    inclusion of an anti-cash hoarding provision that limits the Company's cash balance to no more than   $50.0 million   at any time during which the revolving credit facility is drawn; 
                
    increase minimum liquidity (cash and credit facility availability) required for prepayment of the Company's 2019 convertible senior notes, 2020 senior notes, and 2021 senior notes from   $100.0 million   to   $150.0 million   subject to a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of   2  -to-1; 
                
    permit the Company to create one or more Investment Entities, as defined.  The Investment Entities would be capitalized (i) by the Company, by transferring certain vessels identified in the First Amendment and (ii) by one or more unaffiliated third parties, by depositing cash, with the cash funding being available for acquisitions;  
                
    amend the definitions of EBITDA and Pro Forma EBITDA to provide that, commencing with the earlier of (a) the first full fiscal quarter after the expiration of the interest coverage holiday and (b) the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, or the Applicable Period, and until the third immediately following fiscal quarter thereafter, EBITDA and Pro Forma EBITDA, as applicable, shall mean, with respect to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, (a) for the Applicable Period, EBITDA, or Pro Forma EBITDA, as applicable, for such fiscal quarter multiplied by four, (b) for the Applicable Period and the immediately following fiscal quarter, EBITDA, or Pro Forma EBITDA, as applicable, for such fiscal quarters multiplied by two, and (c) for the Applicable Period and the two immediately following fiscal quarters, EBITDA, or Pro Forma EBITDA, as applicable, for such fiscal quarters multiplied by one and one-third;

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

reduce the amount of liens permitted to secure debt (other than the Amended Facility) of any loan party from   $50.0 million   at any one time to   $15.0 million  , and to prohibit such liens during the interest coverage holiday; 
                
    condition Restricted Payments, as defined, on pro forma compliance with the interest coverage ratio and the total debt-to-capitalization ratio and compliance with a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 2-to-1; 
                
    increase the amount of cash or cash equivalents on deposit or unused availability under the Amended Facility or a combination of both from   $20.0 million   to   $100.0 million   and require a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 2-to-1 in order to permit a loan party to merge with another person, acquire or form a new subsidiary, make an investment (other than in an Investment Entity) or acquire any vessel or other capital assets; and 
                
    limit sales or other dispositions of property or subsidiaries owning properties, other than inventory, certain equipment or investments in the Investment Entities, to (i) less than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated net tangible assets of the Company if at the time of such sale or disposition the senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2-to-1, or (ii) less than ten percent (10%) of the consolidated net tangible assets of the Company if at the time of such sale or disposition the senior secured leverage ratio is greater than 2-to-1. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no amounts drawn under the Company s   $200.0 million   revolving credit facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants required by its revolving credit facility and the full amount of the undrawn borrowing base under the facility was available to the Company for all permissible uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary, but subject to the anti-cash hoarding provision described above.  
  The Company estimates the fair value of its   2020   senior notes,   2021   senior notes and   2019   convertible senior notes by primarily using quoted market prices.  The fair value of the Company s revolving credit facility, when there are outstanding balances, approximates its carrying value.  Given the observability of the inputs to these estimates, the fair values presented for long-term debt have been assigned a Level 2 of the three-level valuation hierarchy.  As of the dates indicated below, the Company had the following face values, carrying values and fair values (in thousands): 

Capitalized Interest 
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company capitalized approximately   $4.2 million   and $  14.3 million  , respectively, of interest costs related to the construction of vessels.  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company capitalized approximately   $6.3 million   and   $18.2 million  , respectively, of interest costs related to the construction of vessels.

6  . Incentive Compensation 
  Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan 
  The Company s stock-based incentive compensation plan covers a maximum of   4.95 million   shares of common stock that allows the Company to grant restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or collectively restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights and fully-vested common stock to employees and directors.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has granted awards covering   4.4 million   shares of common stock under such plan.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted phantom restricted stock units, time-based restricted stock units and fully-vested common stock as noted in the table below.

The shares to be received under the performance-based phantom restricted stock units are calculated based on the Company's performance compared to three pre-determined criteria, as defined by the phantom restricted stock agreements governing such awards.  The actual number of shares that could be received by the award recipients can range from   0%   to   150%   of the awards granted depending on the Company's performance.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   396,369   time-based restricted stock units,   467,272   time-based and   522,402   performance based phantom restricted stock units and   139,133   shares of fully-vested common stock. 
  The fair value of the Company s performance-based restricted stock units and phantom restricted stock units, which is the stock price on the date of grant, is applied to the total shares that are expected to fully vest and is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally   three   years, based on the Company s internal performance measured against the pre-determined criteria, as applicable.  The compensation expense related to time-based restricted stock units and phantom restricted stock units are amortized over a vesting period of up to   three   years, as applicable, and is determined based on the market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant applied to the total shares that are expected to fully vest.  In addition, all phantom restricted stock units are re-measured quarterly and classified as a liability, due to the settlement of these awards in cash.  In addition to the restricted stock units granted in   2016  , the Company granted performance-based and time-based restricted stock units and phantom stock units in prior years.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   389,355   shares, in the aggregate, of stock due to: 1) vestings of restricted stock units, 2) employee purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 3) the issuance of fully-vested common stock. 
  The impact of stock-based compensation expense charges on the Company s operating results are reflected in the table below (in thousands, except for per share data):

7. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Vessel Construction 
  In February 2016, the Company announced plans to enhance the marketability of the   four   remaining 310 class MPSVs.  The first   two   of those MPSVs, which were delivered in the third quarter of 2016, were enhanced by increasing the berthing capacity, expanding the cargo-carrying capabilities and expanding the work area for ROVs.  The functionality of the second   two   MPSVs, which are still under construction, will be increased by adding a 60-foot mid-body plug, installation of an additional crane, increasing the berthing capacity, expanding the cargo-carrying capacities and expanding the work areas for ROVs.  These latter two MPSVs have been upgraded to a 400 class designation.  The incremental aggregate cost of these four conversions and construction change orders will be approximately   $70.0   million.   
  In August 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the shipyard to postpone the delivery of the final two 400 class MPSVs to be delivered under this program to the first and second quarters of 2018 without any additional cost to the Company.  In addition, the payment terms for the remainder of the contract were adjusted to shift $43.3 million of construction milestone draws from the remainder of 2016 and 2017 into 2018.  The Company's fifth OSV newbuild program consists of   four   300 class OSVs,   five   310 class OSVs,   ten   320 class OSVs,   three   310 class MPSVs and   two   400 class MPSVs.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had placed   22   vessels in service under such program.  The aggregate cost of the Company's fifth OSV newbuild program, excluding construction period interest, is expected to be approximately   $1,335.0 million  , of which   $6.9 million  ,   $21.8 million  , and   $43.3 million   are expected to be incurred in the remainder of   2016  ,   2017  , and 2018, respectively.  From the inception of this program through   September 30, 2016  , the Company had incurred   $1,263.0 million  , or   94.6%  , of total expected project costs. 
  Contingencies 
  In the normal course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various claims and legal proceedings in which monetary damages are sought.  It is management's opinion that the Company's liability, if any, under such claims or proceedings would not materially affect the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company insures against losses relating to its vessels, pollution and third party liabilities, including claims by employees under Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or the Jones Act. Third party liabilities and pollution claims that relate to vessel operations are covered by the Company s entry in a mutual protection and indemnity association, or P I Club, as well as by marine liability policies in excess of the P I Club s coverage.  The Company provides reserves for any individual claim deductibles for which the Company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers Company-specific and industry data, as well as management s experience, assumptions and consultation with outside counsel.  As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to its pending claims and revise its estimates.  Although historically revisions to such estimates have not been material, changes in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
  Vessel charters with Petrobras included limitations regarding fuel consumption. Petrobras has asserted claims against the Company relating to excess fuel consumption in 2010 and 2011. The Company s exposure for these assessments, net of amounts accrued, is in the range of approximately   $0.5 million   to   $3.0 million  . The Company disagrees with a majority of these assessments.  During the second quarter of 2015, the Brazilian court ruled in the Company's favor related to these claims.  Subsequent to this ruling, Petrobras has filed and been denied multiple appeals.  Petrobras has the ability to request a final review of the case by the Supreme Court.  While the Company cannot currently estimate the amounts or timing of the resolution of these

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

matters, the Company believes that the outcome will not have a material impact on its liquidity or financial position, but the ultimate resolution could have a material impact on its interim or annual results of operations.       
  During 2013, the Company commenced the process of assigning the in-country vessel management services for its   four   vessels operating in Brazil from a third-party provider to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  As a result, this assignment has been interpreted by local authorities as a new importation of these vessels resulting in an importation assessment ranging from   $0.5 million   to   $3.5 million  .  The Company disagrees with this interpretation and related assessment.  During the third quarter of 2015, the Brazilian court ruled in the Company's favor related to these claims and this decision has been appealed to another court.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these potential duties have not been assessed or recorded in its financial statements.  While the Company cannot estimate the amounts or timing of the resolution of this matter, the Company believes that the outcome will not have a material impact on its liquidity or financial position, but the ultimate resolution could have a material impact on its interim or annual results of operations.   
  During 2012, a customer, ATP Oil and Gas, Inc., initiated a reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which was subsequently converted to a Chapter 7 case.  Pre-petition receivables from ATP are   $4.8 million   and the Company has recorded   $0.9 million   in reserves. The Company believes its claim is secured under the Louisiana Oil Well Lien Act.  A legal challenge related to the Company's liens has been raised in the bankruptcy proceedings by parties whose interests are affected by the liens. The Company, together with its outside legal counsel, believe its lien position is valid, but the Bankruptcy Court has disagreed. The matter is now being reviewed by the federal district court in Houston, Texas.  An unfavorable final judgment would render the Company's position to that of an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding.  While the Company believes that the net receivables are collectible, it will continue to monitor the proceedings, which may result in actual collections that may materially differ from the current estimate.

Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.  Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  See  Forward Looking Statements  for additional discussion regarding risks associated with forward-looking statements.  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  company,   we,   us,   our  or like terms refer to Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated. Please refer to Item 5 Other Information for a glossary of terms used throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we rely on and refer to information regarding our industry from the BOEM, EIA and IHS-Petrodata, Inc.  These organizations are not affiliated with us and are not aware of and have not consented to being named in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  We believe this information is reliable.  In addition, in many cases we have made statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our industry and our position in the industry based on our experience in the industry and our own evaluation of market conditions. 
   
  General  
    
  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , oil prices averaged $41 per barrel.  The drop in oil price, since October 2014, is due to surplus oil, driven in part by a significant rise in U.S. shale oil production, as well as other previously unavailable sources of supply, coupled with Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, suppliers in the Middle East and Russia not reducing their output.  In addition, economic weakness in many regions of the world, notably Europe and China, has reduced the previously expected oil consumption growth rate.  As a result of lower oil prices, major and independent oil companies with deepwater operations have significantly reduced their capital spending budgets, which are the principal demand drivers for our services.  Less spending by our customers combined with a global oversupply of OSVs for current market conditions, including high-spec OSVs in our core markets, have resulted in significant reductions in our dayrates and utilization.  
  The principal issue facing the industry is the ultimate duration of the current downturn.  While we have taken extensive measures to reduce costs, these reductions alone will not be sufficient to mitigate the full impact of revenue loss over an extended period of time.  Even in light of the currently reduced level of EBITDA generation, our cash on hand provides a healthy cushion for the foreseeable future.  However, we do not believe that our current cash on hand, revolving credit availability and cash generated from operations under current market conditions will be sufficient to repay all three tranches of our $1,125.0 million of face value in funded debt that begins to mature in September 2019.  We are proactively considering various ways to address these maturities well in advance and have retained the advisory firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Finance, LLC to advise us in this effort.   
  In the GoM, nine high-spec OSVs have been delivered into the domestic market during   2016  , including one of our own.  We expect an additional 13 high-spec OSVs to be delivered into domestic service through 2018.  We do not anticipate significant growth in the supply of high-spec OSVs beyond the currently anticipated level of 207 of such vessels by the end of 2018.  In the market place, we continue to observe operators shortening or canceling rig contracts, which we believe will further reduce demand for vessels.  During the   third quarter   of   2016  , there was an average of roughly 38 floating rigs available in the GoM, while an average of 22.6 were working.  This average active rig count decreased 4.8 and 14.8 rigs from the sequential and prior-year quarters, respectively.  As of   November 2, 2016  , there were 37 rigs available and 24  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

were working.  However, five floating rigs have contracts that will expire during the remainder of   2016  .  We do not know whether the remaining rigs will receive contract renewals for operations in the GoM.  We expect two new rigs to arrive in the GoM during the   fourth quarter   of   2016  .  Once a rig arrives in the GoM, it can take several months to commence work and, therefore, we do not know the timing of when operations of newly arrived rigs will begin.  Given these market conditions, we anticipate our average dayrates and utilization levels will continue to be depressed.  However, the GoM is one of the premier deepwater markets in the world and we are committed to supporting our customers in this market.  We feel that once the current supply and demand fundamentals return to more normal conditions, our results from operations will improve.     
  In recognition of these weak market conditions, we stacked   45   OSVs on various dates from October 2014 through   September 2016  .   Post quarter-end, we have stacked an additional new generation OSV to date and we currently plan to stack two more vessels during the fourth quarter of 2016.  These 48 stacked vessels represent 71% of our current OSV and MPSV vessel headcount and 54% of our fleetwide total deadweight tonnage.  By stacking vessels, we have significantly reduced and expect to continue reducing our cash outlays and lower our risk profile; however, we will also have fewer revenue-producing units in service that can contribute to our results and produce cash flows to cover our fixed costs and commitments.  While we may choose to stack additional vessels should market conditions warrant, our current expectation is to retain our current active fleet of 24 vessels in the market and to accept contracts at the best available terms even if such contracts are below our cash break even cost of operations. 
  In Mexico, while the energy reform continues to progress, questions remain on the timing of the incremental activity expected in the Mexican deepwater GoM given the current oil price environment.  PEMEX budget reductions have resulted in contract cancellations and drastically curtailed the number of our vessels operating in Mexico from 2015 levels.    In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, six of our Mexican-flagged vessels were stacked.  Nevertheless, we consider Mexico to be a long-term market for our services, especially in light of energy reforms expected to be carried out there.  Despite current oil prices, 26 companies have been pre-approved as bidders for the first Mexican deepwater lease auction, which is scheduled to occur in December 2016.  We continue to explore opportunities to place additional vessels into Mexico to support PEMEX in its ongoing shallow water activity and non-PEMEX customers in support of future shelf and deepwater activity there.  
  In Brazil, Petrobras has moved towards an "all Brazilian flag" vessel fleet, which has limited opportunities in Brazil for foreign-flagged vessels, except where highly specialized services are required.  In January 2016, we placed one of our newbuild HOSMAX 310 class OSVs into Brazilian registry and have imported the vessel into Brazil.  In October 2016,  Brazil enacted new legislation that will allow international oil companies to participate as an operator of pre-salt offshore developments, reversing a policy that reserved these properties to Petrobras exclusively.  By doing so, the Brazilian government has created the possibility that foreign operators might spur additional activity that has been dampened by low oil prices and Petrobras' difficulties.

Our Vessels 
  All of our current vessels are qualified under the Jones Act to engage in U.S. coastwise trade, except for eight foreign-flagged new generation OSVs, one foreign-flagged well-stimulation vessel and two foreign-flagged MPSVs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our 17 active new generation OSVs,   eight   MPSVs and   four   managed OSVs were operating in domestic and international areas as noted in the following table: 
  Operating Areas

    Includes two owned vessels and   four   managed vessels supporting the military. 
       
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP.  In other circumstances, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on available information.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we identified indicators of impairment relating to our vessels.  As required by current accounting guidance, we calculated the probability-weighted undiscounted cash flows for each of our asset groups over their respective remaining useful lives.  The total of the probability-weighted undiscounted cash flows was greater than the net book values of our asset groups and, therefore, we concluded that we did not have an impairment to our long-lived assets as of June 30, 2016.  See Note   4   to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion.  We have not observed any additional indicators of impairment related to our vessels subsequent to June 30, 2016.  We will continue to closely monitor market conditions and potential impairment indicators as long as this market downturn persists. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  The tables below set forth the average dayrates, utilization rates and effective dayrates for our new generation OSVs and the average number and size of vessels owned during the periods indicated.  These vessels generate a substantial portion of our revenues and operating profit.  Excluded from the OSV information below are the results of operations for our MPSVs, our shore-base facility and vessel management services, including the   four   vessels managed for the U.S. Navy.  The Company does not provide average or  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

effective dayrates for its MPSVs.  MPSV dayrates are impacted by highly variable customer-required cost-of-sales associated with ancillary equipment and services, such as ROVs, accommodation units and cranes, which are typically recovered through higher dayrates charged to the customer.  Due to the fact that each of our MPSVs have a workload capacity and significantly higher income-generating potential than each of the Company s new generation OSVs, the utilization and dayrate levels of our MPSVs can have a very large impact on our results of operations.  For this reason, our consolidated operating results, on a period-to-period basis, are disproportionately impacted by the level of dayrates and utilization achieved by our   eight   MPSVs. 

(1) 
    We owned 62 new generation OSVs as of   September 30, 2016  .  Excluded from this data are   eight   MPSVs owned and operated by the Company as well as   four   vessels managed for the U.S. Navy.  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , we placed in service two 310 class OSVs, the   HOS Briarwood   and the   HOS Brass Ring.  
              (2) 
    In response to weak market conditions, we elected to stack   45   new generation OSVs on various dates from October 2014 through   September 2016  .  Active new generation OSVs represent vessels that are immediately available for service during each respective period. 
              (3) 
    Utilization rates are average rates based on a 365-day year.  Vessels are considered utilized when they are generating revenues. 
              (4) 
    Effective utilization rate is based on a denominator comprised only of vessel-days available for service by the active fleet, which excludes the impact of stacked vessel days. 
              (5) 
    Average new generation OSV dayrates represent average revenue per day, which includes charter hire, crewing services, and net brokerage revenues, based on the number of days during the period that the OSVs generated revenues. 
              (6) 
    Effective dayrate represents the average dayrate multiplied by the average utilization rate. 
      
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We disclose and discuss EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure in our public releases, including quarterly earnings releases, investor conference calls and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We define EBITDA as earnings (net income) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. 
  We view EBITDA primarily as a liquidity measure and, as such, we believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this measure is cash flows provided by operating activities. Because EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  EBITDA is widely used by investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental financial measure that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ability to service debt, pay deferred taxes and fund drydocking charges and other maintenance capital expenditures. We also believe the disclosure of EBITDA helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

EBITDA is also a financial metric used by management (i) as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; (ii) as a significant criteria for annual incentive cash compensation including, when applicable, bonuses paid to our executive officers and other shore-based employees; (iii) to compare to the EBITDA of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions; and (iv) to assess our ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness. 
  The following table provides the detailed components of EBITDA as we define that term for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands):   

  The following table reconciles EBITDA to cash flows provided by operating activities for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands): 

In addition, we also make certain adjustments, as applicable, to EBITDA for loss on early extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense and interest income to compute ratios historically used in certain financial covenants of our revolving credit facility with various lenders.  We believe that these ratios are a material component of certain financial covenants in such credit facility and failure to comply with the financial covenants could result in the acceleration of indebtedness or the imposition of restrictions on our financial flexibility.

  Adjustments to EBITDA for Computation of Financial Ratios Used in Debt Covenants    

Set forth below are the material limitations associated with using EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating activities. 
             
    EBITDA does not reflect the future capital expenditure requirements that may be necessary to replace our existing vessels as a result of normal wear and tear, 
                
    EBITDA does not reflect the interest, future principal payments and other financing-related charges necessary to service the debt that we have incurred in acquiring and constructing our vessels, 
                
    EBITDA does not reflect the deferred income taxes that we will eventually have to pay once we are no longer in an overall tax net operating loss carryforward position, as applicable, and 
                
    EBITDA does not reflect changes in our net working capital position. 
     Management compensates for the above-described limitations in using EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure by only using EBITDA to supplement our GAAP results.

Summarized financial information for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues  . Revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $64.4 million  , or   55.3%  , to   $51.9 million   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Our weighted-average active operating fleet for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was 25 and 48 vessels, respectively. 
  Vessel revenues   decreased     $64.6 million  , or   59.7%  , to   $43.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $108.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in vessel revenues was primarily due to soft market conditions worldwide, which led to our decision to stack 28 incremental OSVs on various dates since   June     2015  .  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we had an average of 44.1 vessels stacked compared to 18.1 vessels stacked in the prior-year quarter.  The   decrease   in vessel revenues was partially offset by $3.0 million in revenues earned from the full or partial-period contribution of five vessels that were placed in service since   June     2015   under our fifth OSV newbuild program.  Average new generation OSV dayrates were $  25,639   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to $  25,699   for the same period in   2015  .  Our new generation OSV utilization was   22.0  % for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   50.3%   for the same period in   2015  .  This   decrease   in utilization is primarily due to soft market conditions for high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessels that were stacked.  Our new generation OSVs were stacked for an aggregate of 4,060 days during the   third quarter of 2016  .  Excluding stacked vessel days, our new generation OSV effective utilization was   76.3%   and   72.2%   for the same periods, respectively. Domestic vessel revenues   decreased   $  37.8   million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower dayrates earned by vessels operating in our fleet during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and the stacking of additional vessels since   June     2015  .  Foreign vessel revenues   decreased   $  26.9   million primarily due to an average of 12 OSVs and one MPSV that have relocated to the GoM or have been removed from service on various dates since   June     2015  .  Foreign vessel revenues for the   third quarter of 2016   comprised   19.9%   of our total revenues compared to   32.8%   for the year-ago period.

Non-vessel revenues increased   $0.3 million  , or   3.6%  , to   $8.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.0 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This increase is due to incremental revenues associated with management services provided to an additional third-party vessel during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Such additional revenues were partially offset by lower activity at our shorebase facility.     
  Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $29.4 million  ,   a decrease   of   $25.6 million  , or   46.5%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $54.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Operating expenses   decreased   primarily due to vessels that we removed from our active fleet count through our stacking strategy since   June     2015  , which resulted in a substantial reduction in mariner headcount, mariner pay cuts and reductions in other operating expenses.  This   decrease   was partially offset by $3.7 million of operating costs related to the full or partial-period contribution from newbuilds added to our fleet since   June     2015  .  Aggregate cash operating expenses for our vessels are projected to be in the approximate annual range of $133.0 million to $138.0 million for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  Such cash operating expense estimate is exclusive of any additional repositioning expenses we may incur in connection with the potential relocation of more of our vessels into international markets or back to the GoM, and any customer-required cost-of-sales related to future contract fixtures that are typically recovered through higher dayrates. 
  Depreciation and Amortization  . Depreciation and amortization expense of   $28.0 million   was   $0.7 million  , or   2.5%  ,   higher   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Depreciation   increased   by   $2.5 million   primarily due to the addition of five vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since   June     2015  .  The depreciation   increase   was partially offset by a   decrease   in amortization expense of $1.8 million, which was mainly driven lower by postponed recertifications for certain of our stacked OSVs. Depreciation expense is expected to increase from current levels as the vessels under our current newbuild program are placed in service.  Amortization expense is expected to decrease as the result of the deferral of regulatory recertification activities for vessels that have been stacked. 
  General and Administrative Expense  . G A expense of   $9.0 million  , or   17.4%   of revenues, was   $3.2 million     lower   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in G A expense was primarily attributable to lower shoreside compensation expense and to a lesser extent a decrease in bad debt reserves.  Shoreside compensation expense was lower due to workforce reductions that were implemented in late 2015 and during the first nine months of 2016, as well as lower long-term and short-term incentive compensation expense.  
  Gain on Sale of Assets  .  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold vessel-related equipment for cash consideration of $0.1 million.  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $81,000 ($53,000 after-tax or $0.00 per diluted share).  During the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we completed the sale of one 250EDF class OSV, the   HOS Black Powder  , to the U.S. Navy for cash consideration of   $38.0 million  .  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $11.0 million   (  $6.7 million   after-tax or   $0.19   per diluted share).  
  Operating Income (Loss)  . Operating income   decreased   by   $47.3 million  , or   144.0%  , from income of   $32.8 million   to a loss of   $(14.4) million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for the reasons discussed above. Operating loss as a percentage of revenues was   (27.8%)   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to an operating income margin of   28.2%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense of   $12.8 million     increased     $3.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to capitalizing a lower percentage of interest compared to the prior-year period driven by a lower average construction work-in-progress balance under our nearly completed newbuild program.  We recorded   $4.2 million   of capitalized construction period interest, or roughly   24.7%   of our total interest costs, for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $6.3 million  , or roughly   39.4%   of our total interest costs, for the year-ago period.  
  Interest Income  . Interest income was   $0.4 million   during each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Our average cash balance decreased to $230.1 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $289.0 million for the same period in   2015  . The average interest rate earned

     Table of Contents  

on our invested cash balances was 0.7% and 0.5% during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in average cash balance was primarily due to outflow associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program and lower revenues earned by active vessels operating in our fleet during   2016   compared to the prior year period.  
  Income Tax Expense (Benefit).   Our effective tax rate was (34.7)% and 38.8% for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  We expect our tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be a benefit between (40)% and (45)%, due to a favorable election to be included in our 2015 tax return when filed, but will revert to our historical rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2017.  
  Net Income (Loss)  . Operating performance   decreased   by   $30.9 million   for a reported net loss of   $(16.5) million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net income of   $14.4 million   for the same period during   2015  .  Excluding the gain on sale of assets, net income would have been $7.7 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This year-over-year   decrease   in net income for the   third quarter of 2016   was primarily driven by lower revenues due to soft market conditions discussed above and the reduction of active vessels in our operating fleet.

Summarized financial information for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues  . Revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $204.9 million  , or   52.9%  , to $  182.4 million   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Our weighted-average active operating fleet for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   28   and   51   vessels, respectively. 
  Vessel revenues   decreased     $209.4 million  , or   57.1%  , to   $157.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $366.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in vessel revenues primarily resulted from soft market conditions in the GoM, which led to our decision to stack 40 additional OSVs on various dates from December 2014 through   September 30, 2016  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had an average of 39.9 vessels stacked compared to 15.1 vessels stacked in the prior-year period.  This   decrease   in vessel revenues was partially offset by $13.3 million in revenues earned from the full or partial-period contribution of eight vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since December 2014.  Average new generation OSV dayrates were   $25,488   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $26,885   for the same period in   2015  , a   decrease   of   $1,397  , or   5.2%  . Our new generation OSV utilization was   27.0%   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   57.1%   for the same period in   2015  .  This   decrease   in utilization is primarily due to soft market conditions for high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessels that were stacked during the current-year period.  Our new generation OSVs incurred 147 days of aggregate downtime for regulatory drydockings and were stacked for an aggregate of 10,939 days during the first   nine months   of   2016  .  Excluding stacked vessel days, our new generation OSV effective utilization was   76.0%   and   76.2%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Domestic vessel revenues   decreased   $  119.6 million   from the year-ago period primarily due to lower dayrates earned by vessels operating in our fleet during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the stacking of vessels since December 2014.  Foreign vessel revenues   decreased   $  89.8 million   primarily due to an average of 12 OSVs and one MPSV that have relocated to the GoM from foreign regions or have been stacked on various dates since December 2014.  Foreign vessel revenues for the first   nine months of 2016   comprised   19.1%   of our total vessel revenues compared to   32.7%   for the year-ago period.

Non-vessel revenues   increased     $4.5 million  ,   21.7%  , to   $25.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $20.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in non-vessel revenues is primarily due to incremental revenues associated with management services provided to one additional third-party vessel during   2016   compared to the year-ago period.   
  Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $104.1 million  ,   a decrease   of   $69.8 million  , or   40.1%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $173.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Operating expenses were primarily driven   lower   by vessels that were removed from our active fleet count since December 2014, which resulted in a substantial reduction in mariner headcount coupled with reductions to mariner pay.  This   decrease   was partially offset by $9.9 million of operating costs related to the full or partial-period contribution from vessels added to our fleet since December 2014.  
  Depreciation and Amortization  . Depreciation and amortization expense of   $85.0 million   was $  3.7 million  , or   4.5%  ,   higher   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Depreciation   increased   by   $7.2 million   primarily due to the contribution of eight vessels that were placed in service on various dates since December 2014.  The depreciation   increase   was partially offset by a   decrease   in amortization expense of   $3.5 million  , which was mainly driven by postponed recertifications for certain of our stacked OSVs. Depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase from current levels as the vessels under our current newbuild program are placed in service.  Amortization expense is expected to decrease as the result of the deferral of regulatory recertification activities for vessels that have been stacked.   
  General and Administrative Expense  . G A expense of   $30.1 million  , or   16.5%   of revenues, was   $7.1 million     lower   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in G A expense was primarily due to lower short-term and long-term shoreside compensation expense.  Shoreside compensation expense was lower due to workforce reductions that were implemented in late 2015 and during the first nine months of 2016, as well as lower short-term incentive compensation expense.  These favorable variances were partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in bad debt reserves.   
  Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets.   During the first   nine months of 2016  , we sold our last remaining non-core conventional OSV, the   Cape Breton  , and certain vessel-related equipment for an aggregate cash consideration of $0.5 million.  These sales resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $36,000   ($23,000 after-tax or $0.00 per diluted share).  During the first   nine months   of 2015, we completed the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs previously chartered to the U.S. Navy for cash consideration of $152.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately   $44.1 million   ($27.6 million after-tax or $0.76 per diluted share).  
  Operating Income (Loss)  . Operating income   decreased   by   $175.8 million  , or   126.4%  , to a loss of   $(36.7) million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for the reasons discussed above.  Operating loss as a percentage of revenues was   (20.1%)   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to an operating income margin of   35.9%   for the same period in   2015  .  Excluding the 2015 gain on sale of assets, our operating income for the first   nine months   of   2015   would have been $95.0 million, or 24.5% of revenues.   
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense of   $34.9 million     increased     $5.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to capitalizing a lower percentage of interest compared to the prior-year period driven by a lower average construction work-in-progress balance under our newbuild program in   2016  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $14.3 million   of capitalized construction period interest, or roughly   29.1%   of our total interest costs, compared to having capitalized   $18.2 million  , or roughly   37.8%   of our total interest costs, for the year-ago period.  
  Interest Income  . Interest income was   $1.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which was   $0.2 million     higher   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Our average cash balance decreased to $242.7 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $266.0 million for the same period in   2015  .  The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was 0.6% and 0.5% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in average cash balance was primarily due to outflow associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program and lower revenues earned by active vessels operating in our fleet during   2016   compared to the prior-year period.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit).   Our effective tax rate was (34.8)% and 37.5% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes.  Our income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes. We expect our tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be a benefit between (40)% and (45)%, due to a favorable election to be included in our 2015 tax return when filed, but will revert to our historical rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2017.  
  Net Income (Loss)  . Operating performance decreased by   $114.1 million   for a reported net loss of   $(44.6) million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net income of   $69.5 million   for the same period during   2015  .  Excluding the gain on sale of assets, net income would have been $41.9 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   in net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by lower revenues due to soft market conditions discussed above and the reduction of active vessels in our operating fleet.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our capital requirements have historically been financed with cash flows from operations, proceeds from issuances of our debt and common equity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash received from the sale of assets. We require capital to fund on-going operations, remaining obligations under our expanded fifth OSV newbuild program, vessel recertifications, discretionary capital expenditures and debt service and may require capital to fund potential future vessel construction, retrofit or conversion projects, acquisitions, stock repurchases or the retirement of debt. The nature of our capital requirements and the types of our financing sources are not expected to change significantly for the remainder of   2016   and into   2017  .   
  We have reviewed all of our debt agreements, including our recently amended revolving credit facility, as well as our liquidity position and projected future cash needs.  Despite volatility in commodity markets, we remain confident in the short- and long-term viability of our business model.  To date, our liquidity has been impacted by such volatility through lower than normal cash flow from operations.  However, we project that, even with the current depressed operating levels, cash generated from operations together with cash on hand should be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments at least through the end of 2017, the end of our current guidance period, without drawing on our revolving credit facility. We also believe that we will be able to fund all of the deferred maintenance capital expenditures that will be required upon reactivation of our stacked vessels when market conditions improve with existing sources of liquidity.  We have three tranches of funded unsecured debt outstanding that mature in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.  We remain fully cognizant of the challenges currently facing the offshore oil and gas industry and are proactively taking steps to protect the business enterprise.  Accordingly, we have engaged the advisory firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Finance, LLC to begin the process of independently reviewing our capital structure and assessing our strategic options.     
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total cash and cash equivalents of $  225.5   million.  On   July 29, 2016  , we amended our existing revolving credit facility and as of November 9, 2016 we remain in compliance with all covenants under such facility.  The amended facility provides continued access to a reduced level of standby liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, newbuild and conversion programs and other capital expenditures. The borrowing base of the amended credit facility was reduced from   $300.0 million   to   $200.0 million  .  Among other things, the amended revolving credit facility limits our cash balance to   $50 million   at any time the facility is drawn, increases the minimum liquidity (cash and revolver availability) level required for prepayment of our 2019 convertible senior notes, 2020 senior notes, and 2021 senior notes from   $100 million   to   $150 million  , and increases the minimum liquidity level required to permit a merger, formation or acquisition of a subsidiary or an investment (other than certain permitted investments) from $20 million to $100 million.  The amended facility also increases the unused commitment fee to 50 basis points for all pricing levels and the LIBOR spreads for funded borrowings to a new range of L+225 to L+325.  The minimum collateral-to-loan value ratio under the amended facility was restored to its prior level of   200%   of the borrowing base, which had been reduced to   150%   of the borrowing base when the facility was amended and extended in February 2015.  Accordingly, the number of vessels pledged as collateral was increased from 10 OSVs valued in excess of   $450 million   to 12 OSVs valued in excess of   $400 million  .  None of our remaining assets have been granted as security.  The amended credit facility reduces the minimum interest coverage  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

ratio from   3.00  x to   1.00  x with step-ups to   1.25  x in the third quarter of   2018   and   1.50  x in the first quarter of   2019   and delays the step-down in the total debt-to-capitalization ratio from   55%   to   50%   by   six   quarters to the third quarter of   2018  .  We have the option of making a one-time election to suspend the interest coverage ratio for a holiday period of no more than   four   quarters, ending no later than the fourth quarter of   2017  , with a single permitted rescission.  If the Company elects to exercise the interest coverage holiday, then the borrowing base will be capped at   $75 million   during the period of the holiday and the LIBOR spreads for funded borrowings will be increased by an additional   50   basis points during and after the holiday.  For additional information with respect to other changes to our revolving credit facility, please refer to Note   5   of our consolidated financial statements included herein and the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement referenced as an exhibit to this Form 10-Q.  The full undrawn amount of such facility is available for all uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary, except during an interest coverage ratio holiday, when the borrowing base will be capped at   $75 million  , and subject to the anti-cash hoarding provision discussed above.  If we were not able to maintain compliance with certain covenants of our currently undrawn revolving credit facility, the proceeds of such facility would not be available to us.  
  On October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common stock from time to time, $25 million of which was used to buy-back 891,396 shares during the fourth quarter of   2014  .  There were no such repurchases during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  In addition to the foregoing, we may, subject to market conditions and our other strategic options, from time to time amend, extinguish or repurchase our outstanding debt securities or exchange them for other debt or equity securities or loans.  While we have an authorized share repurchase program, we currently intend, subject to market conditions, to prioritize our cash usage appropriate to the current market cycle, our longer term commitments and our strategic objectives.   
  Although in current market conditions, we were still able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the   third quarter of 2016  , events beyond our control, such as sustained low prices for oil and natural gas, a further significant decline in such commodity prices, renewed regulatory-driven delays in the issuance of drilling plans and permits in the GoM, declines in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, any extended reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products and other reasons discussed under the  Forward Looking Statements  on page ii and the Risk Factors stated in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.  Should the need for additional financing arise, we may not be able to access the capital markets on attractive terms at that time or otherwise obtain sufficient capital to meet our maturing debt obligations or finance growth opportunities that may arise.  We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity position, as well as the state of the global capital and credit markets. 
  Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities  . We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations.  Cash flows from operating activities were $  56.7   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and $  184.5   million for the same period in   2015  .  Operating cash flows for the first   nine months of 2016   were unfavorably affected by soft market conditions for our vessels operating worldwide which led to a decline in our weighted average active operating fleet from   51   to   28   vessels.  
  Investing Activities.   Net cash   used in   investing activities was $  91.8   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $  63.7   million for the same period in   2015  .  Cash used during the first   nine months of 2016   consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program.  Cash used during the first   nine months of 2015   consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program partially offset by proceeds from the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs to the U.S. Navy.    
  Financing Activities  . Net cash   used in   financing activities was   $0.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.1 million   net cash   used in   financing activities for the same period in   2015  .  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the   nine months

ended September 30, 2015   primarily resulted from deferred financing costs related to the amendments of our existing revolving credit facility offset by net proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to our employee stock-based incentive compensation plans.  
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  Debt 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding long-term debt (in thousands, except effective interest rate): 

(1) 
    The senior notes do not require any payments of principal prior to their stated maturity dates, but pursuant to the indentures under which the 2020 and 2021 senior notes were issued, we would be required to make offers to purchase such senior notes upon the occurrence of specified events, such as certain asset sales or a change in control. 
     On   July 29, 2016  , we amended our existing revolving credit facility.  The amended revolving credit facility remains undrawn as of   November 9, 2016  .  With the revolving credit facility, we have the option of borrowing at a variable rate of interest equal to (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 3.25% or (ii) the greatest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or LIBOR, plus 1.0%; plus in each case an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for each base rate is determined by a pricing grid, which is based on a total debt-to-capitalization ratio, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility, as amended.  Unused commitment fees are payable quarterly at the annual rate of   50.0   basis points of the unused portion of the borrowing base of the new revolving credit facility, based on the defined total debt-to-capitalization ratio.  For additional information with respect to our amended revolving credit facility, our 2020 senior notes, our 2021 senior notes and our 2019 convertible senior notes, please refer to Note   5   of our consolidated financial statements included herein. 
  The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our 2020 and 2021 senior notes impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us.  Such restrictions affect, and in many cases limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, redeem equity, create liens, sell assets and pay dividends or make other restricted payments. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. If we do not maintain compliance with certain covenants of our currently undrawn revolving credit facility, the proceeds of such facility will not be available to us.  However, the recent amendment added greater flexibility under applicable covenants, subject to the anti-cash hoarding provision that limits our cash balance to no more than $50 million at any time the facility is drawn and has a balance outstanding and the reduced borrowing base during the period of any interest coverage holiday.  We continuously review our debt covenants and report to our lenders our compliance with financial ratios on a quarterly basis.  We also consider such covenants in evaluating transactions that will have an effect on our financial ratios.

Capital Expenditures and Related Commitments 
  The following table sets forth the amounts incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program, before construction period interest, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and since such program s inception, as well as the estimated total project costs for such program (in millions): 

(1) 
    Estimated Program Totals and Projected Delivery Dates are based on internal estimates and are subject to change due to delays and possible cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including, without limitation, shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, the inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials, component equipment or skilled labor.  All of the above historical and budgeted capital expenditure project amounts for our newbuild program represent estimated cash outlays and do not include any allocation of capitalized construction period interest.  Projected delivery dates correspond to the first and last vessels that are contracted with shipyards for construction and delivery under our currently active program, respectively. 
              (2) 
    Our fifth OSV newbuild program consists of vessel construction contracts with three domestic shipyards to build   four   300 class OSVs,   five   310 class OSVs,   ten   320 class OSVs,   three   310 class MPSVs and   two   400 class MPSVs.  As of   November 2, 2016  , we had placed 22 vessels in service under such program.  The remaining two vessels under this 24-vessel domestic newbuild program are currently expected to be placed in service during   2018  .  
     The following table summarizes the costs incurred, prior to the allocation of construction period interest, for the purposes set forth below, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a forecast for the fiscal year ending December 31,   2016   (in millions): 

(1) 
    Deferred drydocking charges for   2016   include the projected recertification costs for four OSVs and one MPSV. 
              (2) 
    Other vessel capital improvements include costs for discretionary vessel enhancements, which are typically incurred during a planned drydocking event to meet customer specifications. 
              (3) 
    Commercial-related vessel improvements include items such as cranes, ROVs, helidecks, living quarters and other specialized vessel equipment, which costs are typically included in and offset, in whole or in part, by higher dayrates charged to customers. 
              (4) 
    Non-vessel capital expenditures are primarily related to information technology and shoreside support initiatives.

Forward Looking Statements  
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements,  as contemplated by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, in which the Company discusses factors it believes may affect its performance in the future. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than historical facts, such as statements regarding assumptions, expectations, beliefs and projections about future events or conditions. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by the appearance in such a statement of words like  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   may,   might,   plan,   potential,   predict,   project,   remain,   should,   will,  or other comparable words or the negative of such words. The accuracy of the Company s assumptions, expectations, beliefs and projections depends on events or conditions that change over time and are thus susceptible to change based on actual experience, new developments and known and unknown risks. The Company gives no assurance that the forward-looking statements will prove to be correct and does not undertake any duty to update them. The Company s actual future results might differ from the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a variety of reasons, including sustained or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; continued weakness in demand for the Company s services through and beyond the maturity of any of the Company's long-term debt; unplanned customer suspensions, cancellations, rate reductions or non-renewals of vessel charters, vessel management contracts, or failures to finalize commitments to charter or manage vessels; sustained or further reductions in capital spending budgets by customers; the inability to accurately predict vessel utilization levels and dayrates; fewer than anticipated deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling units operating in the GoM or other regions where the Company operates; the effect of inconsistency by the United States government in the pace of issuing drilling permits and plan approvals in the GoM or other drilling regions; the Company s inability to successfully complete the remainder of its current vessel newbuild program on-time and on-budget, which involves the construction and integration of highly complex vessels and systems; the inability to successfully market the vessels that the Company owns, is constructing or might acquire; the government's cancellation or non-renewal of the management, operations and maintenance contracts for vessels; an oil spill or other significant event in the United States or another offshore drilling region that could have a broad impact on deepwater and other offshore energy exploration and production activities, such as the suspension of activities or significant regulatory responses; the imposition of laws or regulations that result in reduced exploration and production activities or that increase the Company s operating costs or operating requirements; environmental litigation that impacts customer plans or projects; disputes with customers; bureaucratic, administrative or operating barriers that delay vessels in foreign markets from going on-hire or result in contractual penalties or deductions imposed by foreign customers; industry risks; the impact stemming from the reduction of Petrobras' announced plans for or administrative barriers to exploration and production activities in Brazil; recent disruption in Mexican offshore activities; age or other restrictions imposed on our vessels by customers; unanticipated difficulty in effectively competing in or operating in international markets; less than anticipated subsea infrastructure and field development demand in the GoM and other markets affecting our MPSVs; sustained vessel over capacity in the markets in which the Company competes; economic and geopolitical risks; weather-related risks; upon a return to improved operating conditions, the shortage of or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, when needed, including vessel personnel for active vessels or vessels the Company may reactivate or acquire; any success in unionizing the Company's U.S. fleet personnel; regulatory risks; the repeal or administrative weakening of the Jones Act or changes in the interpretation of the Jones Act related to the U.S. citizenship qualification; drydocking delays and cost overruns and related risks; vessel accidents, pollution incidents or other events resulting in lost revenue, fines, penalties or other expenses that are unrecoverable from insurance policies or other third parties; unexpected litigation and insurance expenses; or fluctuations in foreign currency valuations compared to the U.S. dollar and risks associated with expanded foreign operations, such as non-compliance with or the unanticipated effect of tax laws, customs laws, immigration laws, or other

legislation that result in higher than anticipated tax rates or other costs; the inability to repatriate foreign-sourced earnings and profits; or the inability of the Company to refinance or otherwise retire funded debt obligations that come due in 2019, 2020 and 2021. In addition, the Company s future results may be impacted by adverse economic conditions, such as inflation, deflation, or lack of liquidity in the capital markets, that may negatively affect it or parties with whom it does business resulting in their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to the Company, such as the failure of customers to fulfill their contractual obligations or the failure by individual banks to provide funding under the Company s credit agreement, if required. Further, the Company can give no assurance regarding when and to what extent it will effect share repurchases. Should one or more of the foregoing risks or uncertainties materialize in a way that negatively impacts the Company, or should the Company s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company s actual results may vary materially from those anticipated in its forward-looking statements, and its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and, if sufficiently severe, could result in noncompliance with certain covenants of the Company's recently amended and currently undrawn revolving credit facility. Additional factors that you should consider are set forth in detail in the  Risk Factors  section of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other filings the Company has made and will make with the Securities and Exchange Commission which, after their filing, can be found on the Company s website, www.hornbeckoffshore.com.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1 Legal Proceedings 
    
  In December 2000, LEEVAC Marine Inc. (a predecessor entity to our current subsidiary Hornbeck Offshore Transportation, LLC, or HOT) was one of several companies that formed a limited liability company, SSIC Remediation, LLC, or SSIC, which conducted interim phase environmental remedial activities at the SBA Shipyards site in Jennings, Louisiana pursuant to a December 9, 2002 Order and Agreement with the EPA.  In 2015, the EPA notified SSIC s counsel of its renewed interest in the site and on September 9, 2016 published a final rule (effective October 11, 2016) adding the site to the General Superfund section of the CERCLA National Priorities List.  In November 2016, HOT and six other parties voluntarily entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study, or RIFS, in connection with the site.  HOT has accrued a liability of $100,000 to cover expenses anticipated to be incurred with respect to conducting the RIFS.  Under the Agreement, HOT s percentage of liability for the RIFS cost and subsequent cleanup efforts with other members of the group is 4%.  The Company has not made a judgment concerning the ultimate cost of clean up should it be required.

              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
