1.    Nature of Operations, Background, and Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information or footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a
comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared following the same
policies and procedures used in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements and reflect all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Xcel
Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the  Company ). The results of operations for the interim periods presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year or for any future interim periods. These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016.    

The Company is a brand management and media
company engaged in the design, production, licensing, marketing, and direct to consumer sales of branded apparel, footwear, accessories,
jewelry, home goods, and other consumer products, and the acquisition of dynamic consumer lifestyle brands. Currently, the Company s
brand portfolio consists of the Isaac Mizrahi brand (the  Isaac Mizrahi Brand ), the Judith Ripka brand (the  Ripka
Brand ), the H by Halston and H Halston brands (collectively, the  H Halston Brands ), the C Wonder brand (the
 C Wonder Brand ), and the Highline Collective brand. The Company also managed and designed the Liz Claiborne New York
brand ( LCNY Brand ) through July 31, 2016. 

The Company licenses its brands to third
parties, provides certain design, production, and marketing services, and generates royalty design and service fee revenues through
licensing and other agreements with manufacturers and retailers. These activities include licensing its own brands for promotion
and distribution through a ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy, which encompasses distribution through interactive television,
the internet, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. 

In December 2014, the Company decided to
close its retail stores. Accordingly, the Company s retail operations are treated and presented as discontinued operations
(see Note 8). 

Certain reclassifications have been made
to the prior period condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. 

For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be
recognized in the income statement as discrete tax items in the interim period in which they occur, clarifies that employee taxes
paid when an employer withholds shares for tax purposes should be presented on the statement of cash flows as a financing activity,
and changes the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows from a financing activity to an operating activity.
ASU 2016-09 also provides for a policy election to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest (as per current GAAP)
or account for forfeitures when they occur. This new accounting guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016 (i.e., calendar years beginning on January 1, 2017), including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of
ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

XCEL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)     

In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ), and in May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ).
These Accounting Standards Updates contain amendments that provide additional guidance, clarification, and practical expedients
related to ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which was issued by
the FASB in May 2014. ASU 2016-10 amends certain aspects of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations
and applying the new revenue guidance to licensing transactions. ASU 2016-12 addresses topics of collectability, presentation of
sales tax collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition, and transition
disclosures. The Company will incorporate the guidance contained in ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 into its overall evaluation and
adoption of ASU 2014-09, which collectively will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods
therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these ASUs will have on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ).
ASU 2016-15 provides guidance and clarification regarding the presentation and classification on the Statement of Cash Flows for
eight specific cash flow issues, including: 

debt prepayment and extinguishment costs,

settlement of zero-coupon (or insignificant
coupon interest rate) debt instruments,     

contingent consideration payments made
after a business combination,     

proceeds from settlement of insurance
claims,     

proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance policies,    

distributions received from equity method
investees,     

beneficial interests in securitization
transactions, and    

separately identifiable cash flows / application
of predominance principle.    

 This new accounting guidance is effective
for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (i.e., calendar years beginning on January 1, 2018), including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply
it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. Early adoption is permitted,
provided all amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU
2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

2.    Trademarks, Goodwill and Other Intangibles  

Trademarks and other intangibles, net consist of the following: 

Amortization expense for intangible assets
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (the  Current Quarter ) and the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the  Prior
Year Quarter ) was $282,000 and $211,000, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 ( Current Nine Months ) and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (the  Prior Year Nine
Months ) was $847,000 and $525,000, respectively. 

The trademarks related to the Isaac Mizrahi
Brand, the Ripka Brand, and the H Halston Brands have been determined to have indefinite useful lives, and accordingly no amortization
has been recorded for these assets. 

XCEL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)     

The Company has $12.371 million of goodwill
related to the 2011 acquisition of the Isaac Mizrahi business. There was no change in goodwill during the Current Nine Months. 

3.    Significant Contracts  

QVC Agreements   

Under the Company s agreements with
QVC, QVC is required to pay the Company fees based primarily on a percentage of its net sales of Isaac Mizrahi, Ripka, H Halston,
and C Wonder branded merchandise. QVC royalty revenue represents a significant portion of the Company s total revenues. Revenues
from QVC totaled $7.00 million and $6.30 million for the Current Quarter and Prior Year Quarter, respectively, representing approximately
84% and 86% of the Company s total revenues, respectively. Revenues from QVC totaled $22.14 million and $17.78 million for
the Current Nine Months and the Prior Year Nine Months, respectively, representing approximately 86% and 88% of the Company s
total revenues, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had receivables from QVC of $7.27 million
and $6.40 million, respectively, representing approximately 83% and 84% of the Company s total receivables, respectively.
Total receivables include $0.29 million and $1.18 million of earned revenue that had been accrued but not billed as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company s net carrying amount
of debt is comprised of the following: 

Xcel Term Loan   

On February 26, 2016, Xcel and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, IM Brands, LLC, JR Licensing, LLC, H Licensing, LLC, C Wonder Licensing, LLC, Xcel Design Group, LLC, IMNY
Retail Management, LLC, and IMNY E-Store, USA, LLC (each a  Guarantor  and collectively, the  Guarantors ),
as Guarantors, entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Bank Hapoalim
B.M. ( BHI ), as agent (the  Agent ), and the financial institutions party thereto as lenders (the  Lenders ).
The Loan Agreement amended and restated the IM Term Loan, the JR Term Loan, and the H Term Loan. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement,
Xcel assumed the obligations of each of IM Brands, LLC, JR Licensing, LLC, and H Licensing, LLC under the respective term loans
with BHI in the aggregate principal amount of $27,875,000 (the loan under the Loan Agreement is referred to as the  Xcel
Term Loan ). 

XCEL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)     

The Xcel Term Loan matures on January 1,
2021. Principal on the Xcel Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments on each of January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1.
The aggregate remaining annual principal payments are as follows: 

Under the Loan Agreement, the Company has
the right to prepay the Xcel Term Loan, provided that any prepayment of less than all of the outstanding balance shall be applied
to the remaining amounts due in inverse order of maturity. If the Xcel Term Loan is prepaid on or prior to the third anniversary
of the closing date (including as a result of an event of default), the Company shall pay an early termination fee as follows:
an amount equal to the principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan on the date of prepayment, multiplied by: (i) two
percent (2.00%) if the Xcel Term Loan is prepaid on or after the closing date and on or before the second anniversary of the closing
date; and (ii) one percent (1.00%) if the Xcel Term Loan is prepaid after the second anniversary of the closing date and on or
before the third anniversary of the closing date. 

Commencing with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017, the Company is required to repay a portion of the Xcel Term Loan in an amount equal to 10% of the excess cash
flow for the fiscal year; provided that no early termination fee shall be payable with respect to any such payment. Excess cash
flow means, for any period, cash flow from operations (before certain permitted distributions) less (i) capital expenditures not
made through the incurrence of indebtedness, (ii) all cash interest and principal and taxes paid or payable during such period,
and (iii) all dividends declared and paid during such period to equity holders of any credit party treated as a disregarded entity
for tax purposes. 

Xcel s obligations under the Loan
Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by all of the assets of Xcel and the Guarantors (as well as any subsidiary
formed or acquired that becomes a credit party to the Loan Agreement) and, subject to certain limitations contained in the Loan
Agreement, equity interests of the Guarantors (as well as any subsidiary formed or acquired that becomes a credit party to the
Loan Agreement). 

The Loan Agreement contains customary covenants,
including reporting requirements, trademark preservation, and the following financial covenants of the Company (on a consolidated
basis with the Guarantors and any subsidiaries subsequently formed or acquired that become a credit party under the Loan Agreement): 

net worth (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of at least $90,000,000 at the end of each fiscal
quarter ending on June 30 and December 31 of each fiscal year;   

a fixed charge ratio of at least 1.20 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ended June 30 and December
31 for the twelve fiscal month period ending on such date;   

The Company was in compliance with all
applicable covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

XCEL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)     

In connection with the refinancing of its
term loan debt, the Company paid $116,000 of fees to or on behalf of BHI. These fees, along with $466,000 of remaining unamortized
deferred finance costs related to the previous term loan debt, have been deferred on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as
a reduction to the carrying value of the Xcel Term Loan, and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Xcel
Term Loan using the interest method. 

Interest on the Xcel Term Loan accrues
at a fixed rate of 5.1% per annum and is payable on each day on which the scheduled principal payments are required to be made.
For the Current Quarter and Prior Year Quarter, the Company incurred interest expense of $340,000 and $304,000, respectively, related
to the Xcel Term Loan. For the Current Nine Months and Prior Year Nine Months, the Company incurred interest expense of $1,003,000
and $918,000, respectively, related to the Xcel Term Loan. 

IM Seller Note   

On September 29, 2011, as part of the consideration
for the purchase of the Isaac Mizrahi Business, the Company issued to IM Ready-Made, LLC ( IM Ready ) a promissory
note in the principal amount of $7,377,000 (as amended, the  IM Seller Note ). The stated interest rate of the IM Seller
Note was 0.25% per annum. Management determined that this rate was below the Company s expected borrowing rate, which was
then estimated at 9.25% per annum. Therefore, the Company discounted the IM Seller Note by $1,740,000 using a 9.0% imputed annual
interest rate, resulting in an initial value of $5,637,000. In addition, on September 29, 2011, the Company prepaid $123,000 of
interest on the IM Seller Note. The imputed interest amount was amortized over the term of the IM Seller Note and recorded as other
interest and finance expense on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

On December 24, 2013, the IM Seller Note
was amended to (1) revise the maturity date to September 30, 2016, (2) revise the date to which the maturity date may be extended
to September 30, 2018, (3) provide the Company with a prepayment right with its common stock, subject to remitting in cash certain
required cash payments and a minimum common stock price of $4.50 per share, and (4) require interim scheduled payments. 

On September 19, 2016, the IM Seller Note
was further amended and restated to (1) revise the maturity date to March 31, 2019, (2) require six semi-annual principal and interest
installment payments of $750,000, commencing on September 30, 2016 and ending on March 31, 2019, (3) revise the stated interest
rate to 2.236% per annum, (4) allow for optional prepayments at any time at the Company s discretion without premium or penalty,
and (5) require that all payments of principal and interest be made in cash. Management assessed and determined that this amendment represented a debt modification and, accordingly, no gain or loss was
recorded. 

The Company paid the scheduled semi-annual installment payment
of $750,000 on September 30, 2016. The aggregate remaining annual principal payments under the IM Seller Note are as follows: 

For the Current Quarter and Prior Year
Quarter, the Company incurred interest expense of $70,000 and $79,000, respectively, which includes amortization of the discount
on the IM Seller Note of $70,000 and $74,000, respectively. For the Current Nine Months and the Prior Year Nine Months, the
Company incurred interest expense of $210,000 and $237,000, respectively, which includes amortization of the discount on the IM
Seller Note of $210,000 and $223,000, respectively. 

XCEL BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)     

Ripka Seller Notes   

On April 3, 2014, as part of the consideration
for the purchase of the Ripka Brand, JR Licensing issued to Ripka promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $6,000,000
(the  Ripka Seller Notes ). The Ripka Seller Notes have a term of five years from the date of issuance, are payable
in cash or shares of the Company s common stock valued at the time of payment, at the Company s option, and with a
floor price of $7.00 per share if paid in stock, with Ripka having certain rights to extend the maturity of the Ripka Seller Notes
in the event the Company s stock is trading at a price of less than $7.00 per share. On February 20, 2015, a portion of the
Ripka Seller Notes was amended and satisfied. 

Management determined that the Company s
expected borrowing rate was estimated to be 7.33% per annum and, therefore, discounted the Ripka Seller Notes by $1,835,000 using
a 7.33% imputed annual interest rate, resulting in an initial value of $4,165,000. The imputed interest amount is being amortized
over the term of the Ripka Seller Notes and recorded as other interest and finance expense on the Company s condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

On February 20, 2015, the Company agreed
to cancel Ripka Seller Notes in the principal amount of $3.0 million and execute in its place: (i) a $2.4 million principal amount
promissory note issued in the name of Ripka (the  $2,400,000 Seller Note ) and (ii) a $600,000 principal amount promissory
note issued in the name of Ripka (the  $600,000 Seller Note ), each with substantially the same terms as the Ripka
Seller Notes; provided, however, that the Company and Ms. Ripka agreed that, upon Ripka s assignment of the $600,000 Seller
Note to a permitted assignee, the principal payments under the $600,000 Seller Note shall accelerate to be payable in eight equal
quarterly installments of $75,000 with the first payment due on March 31, 2015 and with the final principal payment payable on
December 31, 2016. As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the $600,000 Seller Note has not been assigned.
The $2,400,000 Seller Note was assigned by Ripka to Judith Ripka Creations, Inc. and then assigned by Judith Ripka Creations, Inc.
to Thai Jewelry Manufacturer Co. LTD. ( Thai Jewelry ). 

On February 20, 2015, the Company entered
into a release letter (the  Release Letter ) with Thai Jewelry, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Thai
Jewelry an aggregate of 266,667 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the $2,400,000 Seller
Note. On March 25, 2015, the Company issued the shares of common stock pursuant to the Release Letter. The carrying value, net
of the discount at the time of the redemption of the $2.4 million Ripka Seller Notes was $1.79 million and, as a result, the Company
recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.61 million during the Prior Year Nine Months, which is included in the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

On April 21, 2015, the Company satisfied
an additional $3.00 million principal amount of the Ripka Seller Notes by issuing 333,334 shares of the Company s common
stock. The carrying value, net of the discount at the time of the redemption of the $3.00 million Ripka Seller Notes was $2.24
million and, as a result, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.76 million, and when combined with
the loss recorded on February 20, 2015, totals a $1.37 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt which is included in the
accompanying Prior Year Nine Months condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

For both the Current Quarter and Prior
Year Quarter, the Company incurred interest expense of $9,000 and $8,000, respectively, which consists solely of amortization of
the discount on the Ripka Seller Notes. For the Current Nine Months and the Prior Year Nine Months, the Company incurred interest
expense of $26,000 and $96,000, respectively, which consists solely of amortization of the discount on the Ripka Seller Notes.

Contingent Obligation   IM
Seller (QVC Earn-Out)   

The Company was obligated to pay IM Ready
$2.76 million, payable in cash or common stock, at the Company s option, contingent upon IM Brands receiving aggregate net
royalty income of at least $2.5 million from QVC in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2015 with the number of shares
of such stock based upon the greater of (x) $4.50 per share, and (y) the average stock price for the last twenty business days
prior to the time of such issuance. The $2.5 million in net royalty income from QVC for the twelve-month period ended September
30, 2015 was met and, therefore, the Company issued IM Ready 290,473 shares of common stock, valued at $2.51 million as of September
30, 2015 and made a $0.25 million payment in cash in January 2016 to satisfy this obligation. 

Contingent Obligation   JR Seller (Ripka Earn-Out)   

In connection with the purchase of the
Ripka Brand, the Company agreed to pay Ripka additional consideration of up to $5 million in aggregate (the  Ripka Earn-Out ),
payable in cash or shares of the Company s common stock based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock
at the time of payment, and with a floor of $7.00 per share, based on the Ripka Brand achieving in excess of $1 million of net
royalty income during each of the 12-month periods ending on October 1, 2016, 2017 and 2018, less the sum of all earn-out payments
for any prior earn-out period. Net royalty income does not include any revenues generated by interactive television sales or any
revenue accelerated as a result of termination of any license agreement. The Ripka Earn-Out of $3.78 million is recorded in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets of the
Ripka Brand at the acquisition date and the total consideration paid. In accordance with ASC Topic 480, the Ripka Earn-Out obligation
is classified as a liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets because of the variable number of shares
payable under the agreement.  

Contingent Obligations   CW
Seller (C Wonder Earn-Out)   

In connection with the purchase of the
C Wonder Brand, the Company agreed to pay the seller additional consideration (the  C Wonder Earn-Out ), which would
be payable, if at all, in cash or shares of common stock of the Company, at the Company s sole discretion, after June 30,
2019, with a value based on the royalties related directly to the assets the Company acquired pursuant to the purchase agreement.
The value of the earn-out shall be calculated as the positive amount, if any, of (i) two times (A) the maximum net royalties as
calculated for any single twelve month period commencing on July 1 and ending on June 30 between the closing date and June 30,
2019 (each, a  Royalty Target Year ) less (B) $4,000,000, plus (ii) two times the maximum royalty determined based
on a percentage of retail and wholesale sales of C Wonder branded products by the Company as calculated for any single Royalty
Target Year. The C Wonder Earn-Out of $2.85 million is recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based
on the probability of the C Wonder Brand achieving certain net royalty income targets within the earn-out periods and then calculating
the present value of the weighted average payment amount. In accordance with ASC Topic 480, the C Wonder Earn-Out obligation is
classified as a liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets because of the variable number of shares payable
under the agreement. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, total contingent obligations were $6.63 million and $6.88 million, respectively.

5.    Stockholders  Equity  

2011 Equity Incentive Plan   

The Company s 2011 Equity Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated (the  Plan ), is designed and utilized to enable the Company to provide its employees,
officers, directors, consultants and others whose past, present and/or potential contributions to the Company have been, are or
will be important to the success of the Company, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. A total of 13,000,000
shares of common stock are eligible for issuance under the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of any or all of the following
types of awards: stock options, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. The Plan
is administered by the Company s Board of Directors, or, at the Board s discretion, a committee of the Board. 

Effective September 13, 2016, the Plan
was amended to (a) increase the number of shares of common stock reserved and available for distribution under the Plan from 8,000,000
to 13,000,000, and (b) increase the maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to which options or restricted stock
may be granted to any participant from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000. 

The fair value of options and warrants
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The valuation determined by the Black-Scholes option
pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual
and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the expected
life at the time of grant, volatility is based on the average long-term implied volatilities of peer companies, the expected life
is based on the estimated average of the life of options and warrants using the simplified method, and forfeitures are estimated
on the date of grant based on certain historical data. The Company utilizes the simplified method to determine the expected life
of the options and warrants due to insufficient exercise activity during recent years as a basis from which to estimate future
exercise patterns. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts.  

Forfeitures are required to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

For stock option awards for which vesting
is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance targets, the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized is
based upon the Company s projections and estimates of the relevant performance metric(s). 

Stock Options   

Options granted under the Plan expire at
various times   either five, seven, or ten years from the date of grant, depending on the particular grant. 

On March 1, 2016, the Company granted options
to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock to a member of management. The exercise price of the options is $7.00
per share, and one-third of the options will vest on each of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company granted
options to purchase an aggregate of 1,671,500 shares of common stock to certain executives, non-executive management, and employees.
The exercise price of the options is $5.80 per share, and one-third of the options will vest on each of March 31, 2017, March 31,
2018, and March 31, 2019. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company granted
options to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock to certain key employees. The exercise price for 100,000 of
these options is $5.80 per share, and such options will vest on January 1, 2017. The exercise price of the remaining 400,000 options
is $7.50 per share, and the vesting of such options is dependent upon the achievement of certain royalty income targets.

6.    Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings per share ( EPS )
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period, including
stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares of common stock
if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

Shares used in calculating basic and diluted
income (loss) per share are as follows: 

As a result of the net loss from continuing
operations presented for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company calculated diluted earnings per share using basic
weighted-average shares outstanding for those periods, as utilizing diluted shares would be anti-dilutive to loss per share. 

The computation of diluted EPS excludes
the common stock equivalents of the following potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: 

7.    Income Tax  

The effective income tax rate for the Current
Quarter and the Prior Year Quarter from continuing operations was approximately 68% and 54%, respectively, resulting in a $256,000
income tax provision and a $51,000 income tax provision, respectively. 

The effective income tax rate for the Current
Nine Months and the Prior Year Nine Months was approximately 15% and 2%, respectively, resulting in a $3,000 income tax benefit
and a $35,000 income tax provision, respectively. 

During the Current Quarter and the Current
Nine Months, the respective effective tax rates were attributable to recurring permanent differences. Based on the amount of income/(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes compared
to the permanent differences, the effective rate increased by 27% and decreased by 26% for the Current Quarter and the Current
Nine Months, respectively. 

For the Prior Year Nine Months, the Company
recorded a $3.00 million gain on the reduction of contingent obligations related to the acquisition of the Isaac Mizrahi Brand,
partially offset by recurring permanent differences. This gain was not subject to tax and was therefore treated as a discrete item
(permanent difference) occurring in the Prior Year Nine Months. Based on the amount of income from continuing operations before
income taxes compared to the permanent differences, the effective rate increased by 13% and decreased by 39% for the Prior Year
Quarter and the Prior Year Nine Months, respectively.

Overview  

Xcel Brands, Inc. ( Xcel, 
the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) is a brand management and media company engaged
in the design, production, licensing, marketing, and direct to consumer sales of branded apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry,
home goods, and other consumer products, and the acquisition of dynamic consumer lifestyle brands. Currently, our brand portfolio
consists of the Isaac Mizrahi, Judith Ripka, H Halston, C Wonder, and the Highline Collective brands. We also managed and designed
the Liz Claiborne New York brand ( LCNY Brand ) through July 31, 2016. Going forward, our focus shall be on our wholly
owned brands. 

Our objective is to build a diversified
portfolio of lifestyle consumer brands through organic growth and the strategic acquisition of new brands. To achieve growth under
our brands, we are focused on two primary licensing and design activities: 

licensing our brands for distribution through interactive television (i.e. QVC and The Shopping
Channel); and   

licensing our brands to manufacturers and retailers for promotion and distribution through e-commerce,
social commerce, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels.   

We believe that Xcel offers a unique value
proposition to its licensees and customers for the following reasons: 

our management team, including our officers  and directors  historical track records
and relationships within the industry;   

our brand management platform, which has a strong focus on design, production, marketing, and social
media; and   

our operating strategy of licensing brands with significant media presence and driving sales through
our ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy across interactive television, internet and traditional retail channels.   

We license our brands to third parties,
provide certain design, production, and marketing services, and generate royalty design and service fee revenues through licensing
and other agreements with manufacturers and retailers. This includes licensing our own brands for promotion and distribution through
a ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy, which includes distribution through interactive television, the internet, and traditional
brick-and-mortar retail channels. We believe that this strategy distinguishes us from other brand management companies that rely
primarily on their licensees for design, production and distribution, and enables us to leverage the media reach of our interactive
television partners, including through television, digital and social media, to drive sales of products under our brands across
distribution channels.  

Our vision is intended to reimagine shopping,
entertainment, and social as one. By leveraging digital and social media content across all distribution channels, we seek to drive
customer (follower) engagement and generate retail sales across our brands. Our strong relationships with leading retailers and
interactive television companies, such as QVC and The Shopping Channel, enable us to reach consumers in over 350 million homes
worldwide. 

We believe our  virtual vertical 
production platform provides significant competitive advantages compared with traditional wholesale apparel companies that design,
manufacture, and distribute products. We remain focused on our core competencies of licensing, production, design, marketing and
brand development, while outsourcing manufacturing and the related inventory ownership to best-in-class partners. We believe that
we offer 360 degrees of service for a comprehensive solution for our retail partners that addresses many of the challenges facing
the retail industry today. We believe our platform is highly scalable due to our business model s low overhead and working
capital requirements, coupled with minimum guaranteed income levels through our multi-year licensing contracts. Additionally, we
believe we can quickly integrate additional brands into our platform in order to leverage our design, production oversight, and
marketing capabilities and retail and licensee relationships.  

We opened a full-price store and an outlet
store under the Isaac Mizrahi brand in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In December 2014, we decided to close our retail stores. Accordingly,
our retail operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

Our e-commerce operations, which were previously
reported as a component of retail operations, are reported as a component of our licensing business. E-commerce operations are
in the process of being phased out. 

Summary of Operating Results  

The three months ended September
30, 2016 (the  Current Quarter ) compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 (the  Prior Year Quarter )   

Total Revenues   

 Current Quarter total revenues increased
approximately $0.99 million to $8.33 million from $7.34 million in the Prior Year Quarter. This increase was attributable to increases
in net licensing revenues of approximately $1.02 million, partially offset by declines in net e-commerce sales of $0.03 million. 

The increase in net licensing revenues
for the Current Quarter as compared with the Prior Year Quarter was primarily due to (i) higher revenues from our interactive television
business of approximately $1.13 million, driven by acquisitions made in late 2014 and 2015, and (ii) increased revenues recognized
from new strategic license agreements entered into in 2015 and 2016 of approximately $0.31 million. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.42 million associated with the management and design of the LCNY brand, for
which our contract ended in July 2016. 

The decline in net e-commerce sales from
the Prior Year Quarter is the result of management s decision to phase out of e-commerce. 

Gross Profit   

 Gross profit for the Current Quarter was
$8.29 million, compared with $7.29 million for the Prior Year Quarter. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable
to the increase in net licensing revenues described above. 

Operating Expenses   

 Operating expenses totaled $7.45 million
for the Current Quarter, compared with $6.76 million for the Prior Year Quarter. The increase of approximately $0.69 million was
primarily due to an increase in salaries, benefits and employment taxes, largely driven by increased staffing to support ongoing
growth in our brand portfolio, as well as the scaling of our operations and infrastructure to support the ongoing growth of our
business. 

Interest and Finance Expense   

 Interest and finance expense for the Current
Quarter increased by approximately $0.03 million to $0.46 million, compared with $0.43 million in the Prior Year Quarter. This
increase was primarily due to the higher interest rate on our term debt following the February 2016 refinancing (the term debt
interest rate was converted from a variable rate of approximately 4.1% to a fixed rate of 5.1%). 

Income Tax Provision   

 The effective income tax rate for the Current
Quarter was approximately 68% resulting in a $0.26 million income tax provision. During the Current Quarter, the effective tax
rate was attributable to recurring permanent differences. Based on the amount of income from continuing operations before income
taxes compared to the permanent differences, the effective rate increased by 27%. 

The effective income tax rate for the Prior
Year Quarter was approximately 54% which resulted in a $0.05 million income tax provision. For the Prior Year Quarter, the effective
tax rate was attributable to recurring permanent differences. Based on the amount of income from continuing operations before income
taxes compared to the permanent differences, the effective rate decreased by 13%. 

Discontinued Operations   

 The loss from discontinued operations,
net of $0.01 million in the Prior Year Quarter was related to our retail operations and was primarily attributable to wind down
costs associated with the closing of our retail stores. As these wind down and closure activities were essentially completed by
the end of 2015, we had no such costs reported as discontinued operations in the Current Quarter. 

Net Income (Loss)   

 The Company had net income of $0.12 million
for the Current Quarter, compared with net income of $0.03 million for the Prior Year Quarter. 

Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted
EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA   

 The Company had non-GAAP net income of
$1.29 million, or $0.07 per diluted share ( non-GAAP diluted EPS ) for the Current Quarter, compared with non-GAAP
net income of $1.42 million, or non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.08 for the Prior Year Quarter. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP unaudited
term, which we define as net income (loss), exclusive of stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense from discounted debt
related to acquired assets, gain on the reduction of contingent obligations (if any), loss on extinguishment of debt (if any),
non-recurring facility exit charges, and net loss from discontinued operations. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures
do not include the tax effect of the aforementioned adjusting items, due to the nature of these items and the Company s tax
strategy. 

The Company had Adjusted EBITDA of $2.34
million for the Current Quarter, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $2.22 million for the Prior Year Quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is
a non-GAAP unaudited measure, which we define as net income (loss) before stock-based compensation, interest expense and other
financing costs (including gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt), income taxes, other state and local franchise taxes, depreciation
and amortization, gain on the reduction of contingent obligations, non-recurring facility exit charges, and net loss from discontinued
operations. 

Management uses non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP
diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period
on a consistent basis and to identify business trends relating to the Company's results of operations. Management believes Non-GAAP
net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are also useful because they provide supplemental information to assist investors
in evaluating the Company s financial results. 

Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS,
and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, earnings per share, or any other measure
of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Given that non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS,
and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures not deemed to be in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations,
our non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies, including companies in our industry, because other companies may calculate non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS,
and Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than we calculate these measures. 

In evaluating non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP
diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may or may not incur expenses similar to some of the
adjustments in this report. Our presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA does not imply that
our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance,
you should consider non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures,
including our net income and other GAAP results, and not rely on any single financial measure.

The nine months ended September 30,
2016 (the  Current Nine Months ) compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (the  Prior Year Nine
Months )   

Total Revenues   

 Current Nine Months total revenues increased
approximately $5.59 million to $25.84 million from $20.25 million in the Prior Year Nine Months. This increase was attributable
to increases in net licensing revenues of approximately $5.67 million, partially offset by declines in net e-commerce sales of
$0.08 million. 

The increase in net licensing revenues
for the Current Nine Months as compared with the Prior Year Nine Months was primarily due to (i) higher revenues from our interactive
television business of approximately $5.20 million, driven by acquisitions made in late 2014 and 2015, and (ii) increased revenues
recognized from new strategic license agreements entered into in 2015 and 2016 of approximately $1.35 million. These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.88 associated with the management and design of the LCNY brand,
for which our contract ended in July 2016. 

The decline in net e-commerce sales from
the Prior Year Nine Months is the result of management s decision to phase out of e-commerce. 

Gross Profit   

 Gross profit for the Current Nine Months
was $25.69 million, compared with $20.12 million for the Prior Year Nine Months. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable
to the increase in net licensing revenues described above. 

Operating Expenses   

 Operating expenses totaled $24.29 million
for the Current Nine Months, compared with $18.25 million for the Prior Year Nine Months. The increase of approximately $6.04 million
was primarily related to an increase in compensation-related expenses (including stock-based compensation) of approximately $3.18
million, an increase in design and marketing costs of approximately $0.68 million, and an increase in other selling, general and
administrative expenses of approximately $1.96 million, which included non-recurring charges of $0.67 million incurred in the Current
Nine Months in connection with the exit from our former leased office facilities. These increases in expenses were the result of
increased staffing and scaling of our operations and infrastructure in order to support (i) the C Wonder Brand, which we acquired
in July 2015 and which began selling on QVC in March 2016, (ii) the development and operation of our quick-time-response or short
lead time  virtual vertical  production platform, and (iii) launch and related ramp-up of the IMNYC Isaac Mizrahi,
H Halston, and Highline Collective brands at Lord   Taylor and Hudson s Bay department stores in April 2016. 

The increase in depreciation and amortization
expense of approximately $0.22 million was primarily related to the amortization of the C Wonder trademarks acquired in July 2015,
partially offset by certain other intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2015 (see Note 2 in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements). 

Other Expenses (Income)    

 Total other income, net of $1.63 million
for the Prior Year Nine Months was comprised of a $3.00 million gain on the reduction of contingent obligations, partially offset
by a $1.37 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

The gain on the reduction of contingent
obligations in the Prior Year Nine Months was a result of the Company reducing the fair value of its contingent obligation on its
earn-out obligation to the seller of the Isaac Mizrahi Brand. 

The loss on extinguishment of debt in the
Prior Year Nine Months was a result of the Company satisfying $5.40 million principal amount of Ripka Seller Notes by issuing 600,001
shares of our common stock in March and April 2015. The carrying value, net of the discount, of the Ripka Seller Notes at the redemption
date was $4.03 million, resulting in a loss of $1.37 million. 

Interest and Finance Expense   

 Interest and finance expense for the Current
Nine Months increased by approximately $0.05 million to $1.43 million, compared with $1.38 million in the Prior Year Nine Months.
This increase was primarily due to the higher interest rate on our term debt following the February 2016 refinancing (as the term
debt interest rate was converted from a variable rate of approximately 4.1% to a fixed rate of 5.1%) and fees associated with the
refinancing, largely offset by lower interest expense following the satisfaction of $5.40 million principal amount of the Ripka
Seller Notes in March 2015 and April 2015. 

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision   

 The effective income tax rate for the Current
Nine Months was approximately 15% resulting in a $0.003 million income tax benefit. During the Current Nine Months, the effective
tax rate was attributable to recurring permanent differences. Based
on the amount of loss from continuing operations before income taxes compared to the permanent differences, the effective rate
decreased by 26%. 

The effective income tax rate for the Prior
Year Nine Months was approximately 2% which resulted in a $0.04 million income tax provision. For the Prior Year Nine Months, the
Company recorded a $3.00 million gain on the reduction of contingent obligations related to the acquisition of the Isaac Mizrahi
Brand, partially offset by recurring permanent differences. This gain was not subject to tax and was therefore treated as a discrete
item (permanent difference) occurring in the Prior Year Nine Months. Based on the amount of income from continuing operations before
income taxes compared to the permanent differences, the effective rate decreased by 39%. 

Discontinued Operations   

 The loss from discontinued operations,
net of $0.28 million in the Prior Year Nine Months was related to our retail operations and was primarily attributable to compensation
expense, other general and administrative expenses, and wind down costs associated with the closing of our retail stores, partially
offset by an income tax benefit of $0.19 million. As these wind down and closure activities were essentially completed by the end
of 2015, we had no such costs reported as discontinued operations in the Current Nine Months. 

Net (Loss) Income   

 The Company had a net loss of $0.02 million
for the Current Nine Months, compared with net income of $1.81 million for the Prior Year Nine Months. 

Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted
EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA   

 The Company had non-GAAP net income of
$4.64 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for the Current Nine Months, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.20 million, or non-GAAP
diluted EPS of $0.26 for the Prior Year Nine Months. The Company had Adjusted EBITDA of $7.08 million for the Current Nine Months,
compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $6.32 million for the Prior Year Nine Months.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity   

Our principal capital requirements have
been to fund working capital needs, acquire new brands, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were $15.16 million and $16.86 million, respectively. 

We expect that existing cash and operating
cash flows will be adequate to meet our operating needs, debt service obligations (including debt service under the Loan Agreement),
and capital expenditure needs, for at least the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2016. We are dependent on our licensees
for most of our revenues, and there is no assurance that the licensees will perform as projected. 

Our business operating model generally
does not require significant capital expenditures. 

Our contingent obligations (see Note 4,
Debt in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) are payable in stock or cash, at the Company s discretion.
Payment of these obligations in stock would not affect our liquidity. 

Changes in Working Capital   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, our adjusted working capital (current assets less current liabilities, excluding current contingent obligations and seller
notes payable in stock (see Note 4, Debt in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)) was $14.43 million and
$16.14 million, respectively. Commentary on the components of our cash flows used in continuing operations for the Current Nine
Months as compared with the Prior Year Nine Months is set forth below. 

Operating Activities   

Net cash provided by operating activities
from continuing operations was approximately $6.77 million in the Current Nine Months, compared with net cash provided by operating
activities from continuing operations of approximately $1.29 million in the Prior Year Nine Months. 

The Current Nine Months  cash provided
by operating activities was due to the combination of a net loss of $(0.02) million, non-cash expenses of $5.95 million, and the
net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.84 million. Non-cash expenses mainly consisted of $3.75 million of stock-based
compensation, $1.17 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.38 million of amortization of debt discount and deferred finance
costs, and a non-cash charge of $0.65 million related to the exit from our former leased office facilities. The net change in operating
assets and liabilities includes an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.31 million,
largely due to withholding taxes payable related to shares surrendered for taxes on vested stock awards; and an increase in other
liabilities of $1.13 million related to the lease of our new corporate offices and operations facility, and the sublease of our
former offices; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1.21 million, primarily attributable to the increase
in revenues. 

The Prior Year Nine Months  cash
provided by operating activities was comprised of net income of $1.81 million, non-cash expenses of $3.08 million, and a net loss
from discontinued operations, net of $0.28 million, partially offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities of $(3.88)
million. Non-cash expenses mainly consisted of $3.41 million of stock-based compensation, $1.37 million of loss from the extinguishment
of debt, $0.95 million of depreciation and amortization, $(3.0) million of gain from the reduction of contingent obligations, $(0.09)
million deferred income tax benefit, and $0.45 million of amortization of debt discount and deferred finance costs. The $(3.88)
million change in operating assets and liabilities includes an increase of $3.83 million of accounts receivable primarily related
to timing of collections from QVC, including $1.47 million of earned revenue that had been accrued but not billed as of September
30, 2015. 

Net cash provided by operating activities
from discontinued operations in the Prior Year Nine Months was $0.10 million. 

Investing Activities   

Net cash used in investing activities for
the Current Nine Months was approximately $2.34 million, compared with approximately $4.81 million in the Prior Year Nine Months. 

The Current Nine Months  net cash
used in investing activities was primarily attributable to $1.91 million of capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements,
furniture and fixtures, and equipment for our new corporate offices and operations facility, and $0.40 million of restricted cash
related to the security deposit of the subtenant at our former office facilities. 

The Prior Year Nine Months  net cash
used in investing activities was primarily attributable to restricted cash of $1.11 million for a security deposit on the lease
for our new office space, cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the C Wonder Brand of $3.59 million, and capital expenditures
of $0.09 million. 

Financing Activities   

Net cash used in financing activities for
the Current Nine Months was approximately $6.13 million, compared with net cash provided by investing activities for the Prior
Year Nine Months of approximately $11.09 million. 

Net cash used in financing activities for
the Current Nine Months was primarily attributable to payments on our term debt obligations of $3.13 million, payment on our IM
Seller Note obligation of $1.50 million, payment of the QVC Earn-Out obligation of $0.25 million, shares repurchased including
vested restricted stock in exchange for withholding taxes of $1.21 million, and payment of deferred finance costs of $0.07 million. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
for the Prior Year Nine Months was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of $16.11 million,
partially offset by repayments on our long-term debt of $2.26 million, payment on our installment obligation related to the Ripka
Brand of $2.19 million, and $0.71 million of repurchased shares of restricted stock that had vested.  

Other Factors  

We continue to seek to expand and diversify
the types of licensed products being produced under our brands. We plan to continue to diversify the distribution channels within
which licensed products are sold, in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer, consumer, or market sector within
each of our brands. The Mizrahi brand, H Halston brand, and C Wonder brand have a core business in fashion apparel and accessories.
The Ripka brand historically has been focused on fine jewelry, which we believe helps diversify our industry focus while at the
same time complements, expands on, and grows our overall business relationship with QVC. As of July 31, 2016, we no longer manage
and design the Liz Claiborne New York brand. In April 2016, we brought the IMNYC Isaac Mizrahi, H Halston, and Highline Collective
brands to Lord   Taylor and Hudson s Bay department stores through our quick-time-response direct-to-retail  virtual
vertical  production platform, and plan to do the same with the C Wonder Limited brand next year. We also intend to
seek new opportunities, including expansion through interactive television, our  virtual vertical  production platform,
additional domestic and international licensing arrangements, and acquiring additional brands. Our success, however, will still
remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain our brands  awareness and contract with and retain key licensees,
as well as our licensees  ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion and design trends within their respective customer
bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace. Unanticipated changes
in consumer fashion preferences, slowdowns in the U.S. economy, changes in the prices of supplies, consolidation of retail establishments,
and other factors noted in  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as
filed with the SEC could adversely affect our licensees  ability to meet and/or exceed their contractual commitments to us
and thereby adversely affect our future operating results. 

Effects of Inflation  

We do not believe that the relatively moderate
rates of inflation experienced over the past two years in the United States, where we primarily compete, have had a significant
effect on revenues or profitability. If there were an adverse change in the rate of inflation by less than 10%, the expected effect
on net income and cash flows would be immaterial.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
or liquidity.    

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to exercise judgment. We exercise considerable judgment
with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the
date of the financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates and judgments
on a variety of factors, including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and current and expected economic
conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically re-evaluate
our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications
are necessary. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound
accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Because the determination of these estimates
requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.  

Please refer to our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to these policies. 

ITEM 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

A. EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES:  

Our management, under the supervision and
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on, and as of the date of such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 such that the information required to be disclosed in
our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

B. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING:  

There have not been any significant changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.   
       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

In the ordinary course of business, from
time to time we become involved in legal claims and litigation. In the opinion of management, based on consultations with legal
counsel, the disposition of litigation currently pending against us is unlikely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially
adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A.   
       RISK FACTORS    

We operate in a highly competitive industry
that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations. The risks described in Part
I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not the only
risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our financial condition and/or operating results.
