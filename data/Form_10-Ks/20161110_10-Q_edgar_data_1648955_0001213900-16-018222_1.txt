CAPITOL
ACQUISITION CORP. III  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note
1   Organization, Plan of Business Operations and Liquidity  

Capitol
Acquisition Corp. III (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on July 13, 2015 as a blank check company whose
objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization
or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities (a  Business Combination ).  

All
activity through September 30, 2016 relates to the Company s formation, initial public offering ( Offering )
and identifying and investigating prospective target businesses with which to consummate a Business Combination.  

The
registration statement for the Offering was declared effective on October 13, 2015. The Company consummated the Offering of
32,500,000 units on October 19, 2015, including the exercise of the over-allotment option to the extent of 2,500,000 units,
generating gross proceeds of $325,000,000 and net proceeds of $317,665,553 after deducting $7,334,447 of transaction costs
(up to an additional $11,375,000 of deferred underwriting expenses may be paid upon the completion of a Business
Combination). The units sold pursuant to the Offering ( Units ) were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per
Unit. In addition, the Company generated gross and net proceeds of $8,250,000 from the private placement (the  Private
Placement ) of 8,250,000 warrants ( Founders  Warrants ) at a price of $1.00 per warrant to Capitol
Acquisition Management 3 LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder LLC (collectively, the  Sponsors ), entities
affiliated with the Company s executive officers, and the Company s directors.  

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of our Offering and
the Founders  Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to effect a Business Combination successfully.  

Upon
the closing of the Offering, $325,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit sold in the Offering), including the proceeds of the private
placement of the Founders  Warrants was placed in a trust account ( Trust Account ) and may be invested in
U.S.  government securities  within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended the ( Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act until the earlier of (i) the consummation of
the Company s first Business Combination and (ii) the Company s failure to consummate a Business Combination
within the prescribed time. Placing funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against
the Company. Although the Company will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other
entities it engages, execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust
Account, there is no guarantee that such persons will execute such agreements. The Company s executive officers have
agreed that they will be liable under certain circumstances to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced
by the claims of target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered,
contracted for or products sold to the Company. However, there can be no assurance that they will be able to satisfy those
obligations should they arise.  

The
Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business, is required to seek shareholder
approval of such Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares
into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting
in concert or as a  group  (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) will
be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of common stock sold in the Offering without
the Company s prior written consent. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if it has net tangible assets
of at least $5 million upon consummation of the Business Combination and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock
of the Company voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. In connection with any shareholder vote required to approve
any Business Combination, the Sponsors and any other initial shareholders of the Company (collectively, the  Initial Stockholders )
have agreed (i) to vote any of their respective shares in favor of the initial Business Combination and (ii) not to convert any
of their respective shares.  

Pursuant
to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if the Company is unable to complete its initial Business
Combination by October 19, 2017, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining holders of common stock
and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate. If the Company is unable to consummate an initial Business
Combination and is forced to redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust
Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not released to the Company to pay any of its franchise and income taxes (less
up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses).  

If
the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination and expends all of the net proceeds of the Offering not deposited
in the Trust Account, without taking into account any interest earned on the Trust Account, the Company expects that the per-share
conversion price for common stock would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject
to claims of the Company s creditors that are in preference to the claims of the Company s stockholders. In addition,
if the Company is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against it that is not dismissed,
the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in its bankruptcy estate
and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of the Company s common stockholders. Therefore,
the actual per-share redemption price may be less than $10.00.  

The
Company is an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act )
and will remain such for up to five years. However, if the Company s non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period
or the Company s total revenues exceed $1 billion or the market value of the Company s shares of common stock that
are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, the Company
would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, the Company has elected,
under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  

The Company has experienced recurring
net operating losses as well as negative cash flows from operations. The Company s main source of liquidity was from the
Offering and the Private Placement proceeds, from which amounts have been used to fund the search for a prospective target business.
On August 11, 2016, August 12, 2016 and August 15, 2016, the Company s officers and directors (or their affiliates) loaned
the Company an aggregate of $500,000. The Company currently has a cash position of approximately $380,000. The Company subsequently
received new commitments (which commitments replaced and superseded certain prior commitments) from its Chief Executive Officer,
Mark D. Ein, its President and Chief Financial Officer, L. Dyson Dryden, and its independent board members, Lawrence Calcano, Richard
C. Donaldson and Piyush Sodha, to provide additional loans to the Company of up to $767,000 in the aggregate. The August 2016 loans,
and any future ones that may be made by the Company s officers and directors (or their affiliates), are, and will be, evidenced
by notes and would either be repaid upon the consummation of a Business Combination or up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted
into warrants. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its needs for the next twelve months. 

Note
2   Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis
of presentation    

The
accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not
include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
accruals) considered for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period.
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report
on Form 10-K filed on March 24, 2016, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2016.  

Concentration
of credit risk  

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution
which, at times may exceed the federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these
accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents  

The
Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
Company maintains its cash deposits with major financial institutions.  

Cash
and cash equivalents held in Trust Account  

The
amounts held in the Trust Account represent substantially all of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and are classified
as restricted assets since such amounts can only be used by the Company in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents (restricted) held in the Trust Account consisted of
$325,000,000 in United States Treasury securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents
held in trust available for taxes consisted of $349,629 at September 30, 2016.  

Fair
value of financial instruments  

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to
their short-term nature.  

Common
stock subject to possible redemption  

The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480  Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity . Common stock subject to mandatory conversion is classified as a liability instrument and is measured
at fair value. Conditionally convertible common stock (including common stock that features cash conversion rights that are either
within the control of the holder or subject to cash conversion upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s
control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders  equity. The
Company s common stock features certain cash conversion rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company s
control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
common stock subject to possible conversion is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders  equity section
of the Company s balance sheet.  

Loss
Per Share  

Loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture (Note 5). Common stock subject to possible redemption has been excluded
from the calculation of basic loss per share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust
Account earnings. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could,
potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. The Company has not considered
the effect of warrants to purchase shares of common stock in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of
the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic
loss per common share for the period.  

Use
of Estimates  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Income
Taxes  

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally
requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets
will not be realized.  

ASC
740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim period disclosure and transition. The Company is required to file income tax returns in the
United States (federal) and in various state and local jurisdictions. Based on the Company s evaluation, it has been concluded
that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s financial statements. Since
the Company was incorporated on July 13, 2015, the evaluation was performed for the 2015 tax year. The Company believes that its
income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a
material changes to its financial position.  

The
Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of
income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the three months ended September 30,
2016 or the period ended December 31, 2015. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant
payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.  

Subsequent
Events  

Management of the Company evaluates
events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016 through the date which these financial statements
were issued. Based upon the review, management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have
required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements, other than the Company receiving new loan commitments (replacing
and superseding certain prior commitments) of up to $767,000 in the aggregate from its officers and directors, as described in
Note 1 above. 

Note
3   Initial Public Offering and Founders  Warrants  

In
connection with the Offering, on October 19, 2015, the Company sold 32,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit (including 2,500,000 Units
subject to the underwriters  over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of common stock in the Company and one
half of one Warrant of the Company ( Warrants ). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common
stock at a price of $11.50 commencing on the later of 30 days after the Company s completion of a Business Combination or
October 19, 2016 and expiring five years from the completion of a Business Combination. The Company may redeem the Warrants at
a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon 30 days  notice, only in the event that the last sale price of the shares of common stock
is at least $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third day prior to the date
on which notice of redemption is given. If the Company redeems the Warrants as described above, management will have the option
to require all holders that wish to exercise their Warrants to do so on a  cashless basis.  No warrants will be exercisable
for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is not effective within a specified
period following the consummation of an initial Business Combination, Warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective
registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,
exercise Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not
be able to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis. In accordance with the warrant agreement relating to the Warrants to be
sold and issued in the Offering the Company is only required to use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement covering the Warrants.  

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 8,250,000 Founders  Warrants at
a price of $1.00 per warrant to the Sponsors. The Founders  Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units
sold in the Offering except that the Founders  Warrants: (i) are not redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exercised
for cash or on a cashless basis, as described in the registration statement relating to the Offering, so long as they are held
by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. Additionally, the purchasers have agreed not to transfer, assign
or sell any of the Founders  Warrants, including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Founders  Warrants
(except to certain permitted transferees), until 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 24,500,000 Warrants outstanding, which include 8,250,000 Founders 
Warrants.  

Note
4   Commitments and Contingencies  

During
August 2016, the Company issued notes payable to certain shareholders which totaled $500,000.  These notes do not bear interest,
and are repayable upon the consummation of the Company s initial merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, or other
similar business combination.  Upon consummation of a business combination, the note holders have the option to convert their
principal balances into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant.  The terms of these warrants will be identical to those
of the founders  warrants.  

On
October 13, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with the underwriters of the Offering ( Underwriting Agreement ).
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company paid an underwriting discount of 2.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering
as an underwriting discount. The Company also agreed to pay the underwriters in the Offering a deferred underwriting discount
of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Offering ( Deferred Commissions ) which was placed in the Trust Account and is
only payable upon completion of a Business Combination.  

The
Company presently occupies office space provided by two affiliates of the Company s executive officers. Such affiliates
have agreed that, until the Company consummates a Business Combination, they will make such office space, as well as certain office
and secretarial services, available to the Company, as may be required by the Company from time to time. The Company will pay
such affiliates an aggregate of $10,000 per month for such services.  

The
Initial Stockholders and the holders of the Founders  Warrants (or underlying shares of common stock) will be entitled to
registration rights with respect to their initial shares and the Founders  Warrants (or underlying shares of common stock)
pursuant to an agreement signed on the effective date of the Offering. The holders of the majority of the initial shares are entitled
to demand that the Company register these shares at any time commencing three months prior to the first anniversary of the consummation
of a Business Combination. The holders of the Founders  Warrants (or underlying shares of common stock) are entitled to
demand that the Company register these securities at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition,
the Initial Stockholders and holders of the Founders  Warrants (or underlying shares of common stock) have certain  piggy-back 
registration rights on registration statements filed after the Company s consummation of a Business Combination.  

The
Company entered into three consulting arrangements for services to help identify and introduce the Company to potential targets
and provide assistance with due diligence, deal structuring, documentation and obtaining stockholder approval for a business combination.
These agreements provide for an aggregate annual fee of $550,000 and success fee of $925,000 upon the consummation of a business
combination.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis.   

Forward-Looking
Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). We have based
these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements
are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology
such as  may,   should,   could,   would,   expect,   plan, 
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   continue,  or the negative of such terms
or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those
described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filings. References to  we ,  us ,
 our  or the  Company  are to Capitol Acquisition Corp. III, except where the context requires otherwise.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included
elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

We
are a blank check company in the development stage, formed on July 13, 2015 to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one
or more businesses or entities. We do not have any specific initial business transaction under consideration, but we are actively
searching for a target business.  

We
presently have no revenue, have had losses since inception from incurring formation costs and have no other operations other than
the active solicitation of a target business with which to complete a business combination. We have relied upon the sale of our
securities and loans from our officers and directors to fund our operations.  

The
registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on October 13, 2015. On October 19, 2013, we consummated
the offering ( Public Offering ) and received proceeds net of the underwriter s discount and other offering
expenses of $317,665,553 and simultaneously received $8,250,000 from the issuance of 8,250,000 warrants in a private placement
( Private Placement ). Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds
of the offering and the Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally
towards consummating a business combination successfully.  

Results
of Operations   

Our
entire activity from inception up to the closing of our initial public offering on October 19, 2015 was in preparation for that
event. Since the offering, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of business combination candidates, and we will not
be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate
small amounts of non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. Interest income is not expected
to be significant in view of current low interest rates on risk- free investments (treasury securities). We expect to incur increased
expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as
for due diligence expenses.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $148,083 and $588,089, respectively. We incurred operating
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $366,322 and $1,163,832, respectively. Our operating expenses
for the period from July 13, 2015 (inception) through September 30, 2015 were $983. These costs consist mainly of professional
and consulting fees, rent, and office administrative costs.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash of approximately $380,000. In addition, we had $325,349,629 in cash and equivalents held in
trust, of which $349,629 represents amounts available to be used for tax purposes. Additionally, we have $120,759 in accrued interest
income to be used for tax purposes. The $325,000,000 of restricted funds is to be used for a business combination or to convert
our common shares, in certain circumstances.  

Our
activity from July 13, 2015 (inception) through October 19, 2015 was to prepare for our initial public offering. Since October
19, 2015 our efforts have been devoted to identifying an acquisition candidate. We intend to use the proceeds not held in the
trust account to fund our working capital requirements. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect
a business combination.  

We
will depend on funds on hand to provide us with the working capital necessary to identify one or more target businesses, conduct
due diligence and complete a Business Combination. Additionally, we may use interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account
to pay any franchise and income taxes that we may owe. The amounts in the Trust Account may be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Interest income is not expected to be
significant in view of current low interest rates on risk-free investments (treasury securities).  

The Company has experienced recurring
net operating losses as well as negative cash flows from operations. The Company s main source of liquidity was from the
Offering and the Private Placement proceeds, from which amounts have been used to fund the search for a prospective target business.
On August 11, 2016, August 12, 2016 and August 15, 2016, the Company s officers and directors (or their affiliates) loaned
the Company an aggregate of $500,000. The Company currently has a cash position of approximately $380,000. The Company subsequently
received new commitments (which commitments replaced and superseded certain prior commitments) from its Chief Executive Officer,
Mark D. Ein, its President and Chief Financial Officer, L. Dyson Dryden, and its independent board members, Lawrence Calcano, Richard
C. Donaldson and Piyush Sodha, to provide additional loans to the Company of up to $767,000 in the aggregate. The August 2016 loans,
and any future ones that may be made by the Company s officers and directors (or their affiliates), are, and will be, evidenced
by notes and would either be repaid upon the consummation of a Business Combination or up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted
into warrants. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its needs for the next twelve months. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

From
our inception through September 30, 2016, our efforts were limited to organizational activities, activities relating to our initial
public offering and the search for an acquisition candidate; we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues.  

Market
risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument. These changes
may be the result of various factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and/or equity prices.
Net proceeds from our initial public offering of $325.0 million (which includes approximately $11.4 million of the proceeds attributable
to the Underwriters  deferred discount from the initial public offering) have been placed in a trust account at J. P. Morgan
Securities, with Continental Stock Transfer   Trust Company acting as trustee. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of restricted
cash and cash equivalents held in the trust account was $325.0 million. The proceeds held in trust are invested in United States
Treasury Bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. As of September 30, 2016, the effective annualized interest rate payable on
our Treasury Bills was approximately 0.27%. Due to the short-term nature of these investments and the low interest rates related
to these types of investments, we believe there will be no material exposure related to interest rate risk. We do not believe
that the effect of other changes, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and/or equity prices currently pose significant
market risk for us.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during
the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and,
accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter of 2016 covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities   

In
July 2015, we issued 10,062,500 shares of common stock to Capitol Acquisition Management 3 LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder
3 LLC for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share, in connection with our organization. Capitol
Acquisition Management 3 LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder 3 LLC subsequently transferred a portion of these shares to certain
individuals, including our independent directors, for the same purchase price originally paid for such shares. In October 2015,
our sponsors then contributed back to our capital, for no additional consideration, an aggregate of 1,437,500 shares, leaving
our initial stockholders, including our sponsors and directors, with an aggregate of 8,625,000 founders  shares. This number
included an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option was not exercised in full
by the underwriters. An aggregate of 500,000 shares were forfeited based on the amount of units sold pursuant to the over-allotment
option. The foregoing issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ).  

On
October 19, 2015, we consummated the Public Offering of 32,500,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and
one half of one warrant ( Warrant ), each whole Warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50
per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $325,000,000. Citigroup,
Deutsche Bank Securities and Credit Suisse acted as joint book-running managers of the Public Offering. The securities in the
offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-206693). The Securities and
Exchange Commission declared the registration statement effective on October 13, 2015.  

Simultaneous
with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 8,250,000 Founders  Warrants to the
Company s sponsors and directors at a price of $1.00 per Founders  Warrant, generating total proceeds of $8,250,000.
This issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  

The
Founders  Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering except that the Founders 
Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and, if we call the Warrants for redemption, the Founders  Warrants will not
be redeemable by us so long as they are held by these purchasers or their affiliates. The purchasers of the Founders  Warrants
have agreed that the Founders  Warrants will not be sold or transferred by them (except in limited situations) until 30
days after we have completed a business combination.  

Of
the gross proceeds received from the IPO and Private Placement, $325,000,000 was placed in trust account.  

We
paid a total of $6.5 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and $834,447 for other costs and expenses related to our
formation and the Public Offering.  

For
a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.
