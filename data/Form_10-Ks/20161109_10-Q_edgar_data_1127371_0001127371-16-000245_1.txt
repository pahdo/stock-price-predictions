Note 1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Central Valley Community Bancorp and subsidiary have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central Valley Community Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary Central Valley Community Bank (the Bank) (collectively, the Company).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been omitted.  The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position at   September 30, 2016  , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the   three   and   nine   month interim periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   have been included.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the   2016   presentation.  Reclassifications had no effect on prior period net income or shareholders  equity.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 
         The preparation of these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
         Management has determined that since all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment, and management does not allocate resources based on the performance of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment.  No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank. 
  The Company terminated its interest in Central Valley Community Insurance Service, LLC (CVCIS) at the beginning of the third quarter of 2015.  The Bank s interest in CVCIS was originally established in 2006 for the purpose of providing health, commercial property and casualty insurance products and services primarily to business customers.  The termination of this entity did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
  Impact of New Financial Accounting Standards: 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03   -   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  :  ASU 2015-03 requires the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-03.  ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016, and did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-16   -   Business Combinations (Subtopic 805) - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  :  ASU 2015-16 requires that adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  Furthermore, the income statement effects of such adjustments, if any, must be calculated as if the accounting had  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

been completed at the acquisition date.  The portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date is required to be reported separately on the face of the income statement, or disclosed within the footnotes to the financial statements.  Under previous guidance, adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are to be recognized retrospectively.  ASU 2015-16 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016, and did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01   -   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  :    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,   was issued January 2016.  ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  Most notably the ASU changes the income statement impact of equity investments held by the Company and the requirement for the Company to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.  The Company will be required to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018.  Management is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02   -   Leases - Overall (Subtopic 845)  :  was issued February 2016.  ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases.  The accounting for lessors is largely unchanged.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  Management is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09   -   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718)  :    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   was issued March 2016.  ASU 2016-09 addresses simplification of several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13   -   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Subtopic 326)  :     Financial Instruments - Credit Losses   was issued June 2016.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 to Topic 326, require that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The ASU also requires enhanced disclosures, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on AFS debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Management is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15   -   Statement of Cash Flows (Subtopic 230)  :    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   was issued August 2016.  The amendments in ASU 2016-15 to Topic 230, seek to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  For public entities, the ASU becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  Management is evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on the Company s financial statements. 

Note 2.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
    
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  In accordance with applicable guidance, the Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.  Valuations within these levels are based upon: 
    
  Level 1     Quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

8 

     Table of Contents  

Level 2     Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3     Model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market.  These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability.  Valuation techniques include management judgment and estimation which may be significant. 
    
  Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.  In such instances, we report the transfer at the beginning of the reporting period.  The estimated carrying and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows (in thousands): 

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments.  In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates. 
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

These estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instruments.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the fair values presented. 
  The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values are described as follows: 
    
  (a)  Cash and Cash Equivalents         The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other banks, and Federal funds sold approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.   
    
  (b)  Investment Securities     Investment securities in Level 1 are mutual funds and fair values are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.  Fair values for investment securities classified in Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets.  For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators. 
    
  (c)  Loans     Fair values of loans are estimated as follows:  For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification.  Purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans are measured at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition.  Carrying value is calculated as the present value of expected cash flows and approximates fair value.  Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification.  Impaired loans are initially valued at the lower of cost or fair value.  Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses.  For collateral dependent real estate loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.  The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 
    
  (d)  FHLB Stock     It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 
    
  (e)  Other real estate owned     OREO is measured at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  The Company records OREO as non-recurring with level 3 measurement inputs. 
    
  (f)  Deposits     Fair value of demand deposit, savings, and money market accounts  are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount), resulting in a Level 1 classification.  Fair value for fixed and variable rate certificates of deposit are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates offered at each reporting date by the Company for certificates with similar remaining maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
    
  (g)  Short-Term Borrowings     The fair values of the Company s federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, generally maturing within ninety days, are based on the market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
    
  (h)  Other Borrowings     The fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification. 
    
  (i)  Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable     The fair value of accrued interest receivable and payable is based on the fair value hierarchy of the related asset or liability. 

10 

     Table of Contents  

(j)  Off-Balance Sheet Instruments     Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing.  The fair value of commitments is not considered significant for financial reporting purposes. 
    
  Assets Recorded at Fair Value 
    
  The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  : 
    
  Recurring Basis 
    
  The Company is required or permitted to record the following assets at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands).  

Securities in Level 1 are mutual funds and fair values are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.  Fair values for available-for-sale investment securities in Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets.  For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators. 
  Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , no transfers between levels occurred. 
  There were no Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at or during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  Also there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Non-recurring Basis 
    
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  These include assets and liabilities that are measured at the lower of cost or fair value that were recognized at fair value which was below cost at   September 30, 2016   (in thousands). 

At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value.  Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses.  For collateral dependent real estate loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

fair value.  Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  The fair value of impaired loans is based on the fair value of the collateral.  Impaired loans were determined to be collateral dependent and categorized as Level 3 due to ongoing real estate market conditions resulting in inactive market data, which in turn required the use of unobservable inputs and assumptions in fair value measurements.  Impaired loans evaluated under the discounted cash flow method are excluded from the table above.  The discounted cash flow methods as prescribed by ASC Topic 310 is not a fair value measurement since the discount rate utilized is the loan s effective interest rate which is not a market rate.  There were no changes in valuation techniques used during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.  Once received, the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value is compared with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. 
  Impaired loans that are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a principal balance of   $58,000   with a valuation allowance of   $35,000   at   September 30, 2016  , resulting in fair value of   $23,000  .  The valuation allowance represents specific allocations for the allowance for credit losses for impaired loans.   
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , specific allocation for the allowance for credit losses related to loans carried at fair value was   $35,000   compared to   none   during 2015 related to loans carried at fair value.  There were no charge-offs related to loans carried at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  In 2016, other repossessed assets were recorded at their estimated realizable value of   $363,000  .  There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  : 
    
  Recurring Basis 
    
  The Company is required or permitted to record the following assets at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015   (in thousands). 

Securities in Level 1 are mutual funds and fair values are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.  Fair values for available-for-sale investment securities in Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets.  For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators. 
       Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings.  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , no transfers between levels occurred. 
  There were no Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at or during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Also there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   December 31, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Non-recurring Basis 
    
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  These include assets and liabilities that are measured at the lower of cost or fair value that were recognized at fair value which was below cost at   December 31, 2015   (in thousands). 

At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value.  Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses.  For collateral dependent real estate loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.  Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.  Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  The fair value of impaired loans is based on the fair value of the collateral.  Impaired loans were determined to be collateral dependent and categorized as Level 3 due to ongoing real estate market conditions resulting in inactive market data, which in turn required the use of unobservable inputs and assumptions in fair value measurements.  Impaired loans evaluated under the discounted cash flow method are excluded from the table above.  The discounted cash flow method as prescribed by ASC Topic 310 is not a fair value measurement since the discount rate utilized is the loan s effective interest rate which is not a market rate.  There were no changes in valuation techniques used during the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   
  Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.  Once received, the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value is compared with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.     
  Impaired loans that are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a principal balance of   $166,000   with a valuation allowance of   $34,000   at   December 31, 2015  , resulting in fair value of   $132,000  .  The valuation allowance represents specific allocations for the allowance for credit losses for impaired loans. 
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   provision for credit losses related to loans carried at fair value.  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   net charge-offs related to loans carried at fair value. 
  There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  Note 3.  Investments 
    
  The investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government sponsored entity and agency securities collateralized by residential mortgage obligations, private label residential mortgage backed securities (PLRMBS), and obligations of states and political subdivisions securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $110,723,000   of these securities were held as collateral for borrowing arrangements, public funds, and for other purposes. 
       The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio reflected a net unrealized gain of   $18,031,000   at   September 30, 2016   compared to an unrealized gain of   $7,474,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The unrealized gain recorded is net of   $7,581,000   and   $3,076,000   in tax liabilities as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

During 2014, to better manage our interest rate risk, the Company transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity selected municipal securities in our portfolio having a book value of approximately   $31 million  , a market value of approximately   $32 million  , and a net unrecognized gain of approximately   $163,000  .  This transfer was completed after careful consideration of our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.  During the first quarter of 2016, management sold certain investment securities of which management discovered, through the proper operation of the Company s internal control, that   five   of the   13   securities sold were previously designated as held-to-maturity (HTM).  Through an oversight during the portfolio restructuring analysis related to this transaction, management unintentionally sold these   five   HTM securities.  The book value of the HTM securities sold was   $8.5 million  .  The gain realized on the sale of the HTM securities was   $696,000  .  As such, management was required to reclassify the remaining HTM securities with a fair value of   $23.1 million   to the AFS designation.  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 the remaining unaccreted balance of these HTM securities associated with the original transfer from AFS to HTM and included in accumulated other comprehensive income was   $0   and   $64,000  , respectively.   
  Losses recognized in 2016 and 2015 were incurred in order to reposition the investment securities portfolio based on the current rate environment.  The securities which were sold at a loss were acquired when the rate environment was not as volatile.  The securities which were sold were primarily purchased several years ago to serve a purpose in the rate environment in which the securities were purchased.  The Company is addressing risks in the security portfolio by selling these securities and using proceeds to purchase securities that fit with the Company s current risk profile. 
  The provision for income taxes includes   $469,000   and   $601,000   income tax impact from the reclassification of unrealized net gains on securities to realized net gains on securities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The provision for income taxes includes   $142,000   and   $301,000   income tax impact from the reclassification of unrealized net gains on available-for-sale securities to realized net gains on available-for-sale securities for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Investment securities, aggregated by investment category, with unrealized losses as of the dates indicated are summarized and classified according to the duration of the loss period as follows (in thousands):

We periodically evaluate each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment, relying primarily on industry analyst reports, observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations.  The portion of the impairment that is attributable to a shortage in the present value of expected future cash flows relative to the amortized cost should be recorded as a current period charge to earnings.  The discount rate in this analysis is the original yield expected at time of purchase.     
         As of September 30, 2016, the Company performed an analysis of the investment portfolio to determine whether any of the investments held in the portfolio had an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI).  Management evaluated all individual available-for-sale investment securities with an unrealized loss at September 30, 2016 and identified those that had an unrealized loss for at least a consecutive 12 month period, which had an unrealized loss at September 30, 2016 greater than 10% of the recorded book value on that date, or which had an unrealized loss of more than $10,000.  Management also analyzed any securities that may have been downgraded by credit rating agencies.    
  For those bonds that met the evaluation criteria, management obtained and reviewed the most recently published national credit ratings for those bonds.  For those bonds that were obligations of states and political subdivisions with an investment grade rating by the rating agencies, management also evaluated the financial condition of the municipality and any applicable municipal bond insurance provider and concluded during March 2016 that a   $136,000   credit related impairment related to   one   security with a fair value of   $2,995,000   and a pre-impairment amortized cost of   $3,131,000   existed.  The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of   $136,000   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   OTTI losses recorded during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   or during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  U.S. Government Agencies 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   17   U.S. Government agency securities, of which   6   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   two   were in a loss position or had been in a loss position for 12 months or more.  The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate changes.  The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized costs of the investment.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell, those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   158   obligations of states and political subdivision securities of which   13   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   none   were in a loss position or had been in a loss position for 12 months or more.    The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in obligations of states and political subdivision securities were caused by interest rate changes.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability to hold and does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.     
    
  U.S. Government Sponsored Entities and Agencies Collateralized by Residential Mortgage Obligations 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   168   U.S. Government sponsored entity and agency securities collateralized by residential mortgage obligations of which   28   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   11   have been in a loss position for more than 12 months.  The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations were caused by interest rate changes.  The contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency or sponsored entity of the U.S. Government.  Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability to hold and does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments until

a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Private Label Residential Mortgage Backed Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total of   16   PLRMBS with a remaining principal balance of   $1,895,000   and a net unrealized gain of approximately   $1,064,000  .    None   of these securities was recorded with an unrealized loss at   September 30, 2016  .    11   of these PLRMBS with a remaining principal balance of   $1,711,000   had credit ratings below investment grade.  The Company continues to monitor these securities for indications that declines in value, if any, may be other-than-temporary.   
    
  Other Equity Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   mutual fund equity investment which had an unrealized gain at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  The following tables provide a roll forward for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   of investment securities credit losses recorded in earnings.  The beginning balance represents the credit loss component for which OTTI occurred on debt securities in prior periods.  Additions represent the first time a debt security was credit impaired or when subsequent credit impairments have occurred on securities for which OTTI credit losses have been previously recognized.  

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale investment securities at   September 30, 2016   by contractual maturity is shown below (in thousands).

Note 4.  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  Outstanding loans are summarized as follows: 

The table above includes loans acquired at fair value on July 1, 2013 when the Company acquired Visalia Community Bank (VCB), in a combined cash and stock transaction.  The acquired VCB assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.  Loans acquired in the VCB acquisition had outstanding balances of   $50,568,000   and   $62,395,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans originated under Small Business Administration (SBA) programs totaling   $14,191,000   and   $10,704,000  , respectively, were included in the real estate and commercial categories, of which,   $10,381,000   or   73%   and   $7,295,000   or   68%  , respectively, are secured by government guarantees.   
  The allowance for credit losses (the  Allowance ) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio.  The Allowance is established through a provision for credit losses which is charged to expense.  Additions to the Allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total Allowance after credit losses and loan growth.  Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the Allowance.  Cash received on previously charged-off credits is recorded as a recovery to the Allowance.  The overall Allowance consists of   two   primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for probable incurred losses related to loans that are not impaired. 
  For all portfolio segments, the determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, including but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment (and in certain cases peer data) over the most recent   20   quarters, and qualitative factors including economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole.

For the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , foregone interest on nonaccrual loans totaled   $12,000   and   $91,000  , respectively.  
    
  Troubled Debt Restructurings: 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has a recorded investment in troubled debt restructurings of   $3,153,000   and   $5,623,000  , respectively.  The Company has allocated $  3,000   and   $1,000   of specific reserves to loans whose terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company has committed to lend   no   additional amounts as of   September 30, 2016   to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. 
  During the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016     two   loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings.  The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan or an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk.  During the same period, there were no troubled debt restructurings in which the amount of principal or accrued interest owed from the borrower was forgiven or which resulted in a charge-off or change to the allowance for loan losses.

During the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015     two   loans were modified as troubled debt restructurings.  The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan or an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk.  During the same period, there were   no   troubled debt restructurings in which the amount of principal or accrued interest owed from the borrower was forgiven or which resulted in a charge-off or change to the allowance for loan losses. 
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015     no   loans were modified as troubled debt restructuring.  A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.  There were   no   defaults on troubled debt restructurings, within twelve months following the modification, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  . 

Note 5.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Business combinations involving the Company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise give rise to goodwill.  Total goodwill at   September 30, 2016   was   $29,917,000   consisting of   $14,643,000  ,   $8,934,000  , and   $6,340,000   representing the excess of the cost of Service 1  st   Bancorp, Bank of Madera County, and Visalia Community Bank, respectively, over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisitions and is not deductible for tax purposes.  A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment.  For that reason, goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment.  
  The Company has selected September 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  As of September 30, 2016, management assessed qualitative factors including performance trends and noted no factors indicating goodwill impairment. 
       Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount.  No such events or circumstances arose during the first   nine months   of   2016  .  
  The intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   represent the estimated fair value of the core deposit relationships acquired in the 2013 acquisition of Visalia Community Bank of   $1,365,000  , and Service 1  st   Bancorp in 2008 of   $1,400,000  .  Core deposit intangibles are being amortized by the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over an estimated life of   seven   to   ten   years from the date of acquisition.  The carrying value of intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   was   $922,000   net of   $1,843,000   in accumulated amortization expense.  Management evaluates the remaining useful lives quarterly to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  Based on the evaluation, no changes to the remaining useful lives was required in the   third   quarter of   2016  . Management performed an annual impairment test on core deposit intangibles as of   September 30, 2016   and determined no impairment was necessary.  Amortization expense recognized was   $102,000   and   $253,000   for the   nine   month periods ended

September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  Amortization expense recognized was   $34,000   and   $85,000   for the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  The Service 1st Bancorp core deposit became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
  The following table summarizes the Company s estimated remaining core deposit intangible amortization expense for each of the next five years (in thousands): 

Note 6.      Borrowing Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco advances.   
  FHLB advances are secured under the standard credit and securities-backed credit programs.  Investment securities with amortized costs totaling   $631,000   and   $750,000  , and market values totaling   $694,000   and   $825,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged under the securities-backed credit program.  The Bank s credit limit varies according to the amount and composition of the investment and loan portfolios pledged as collateral.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no Federal funds purchased. 

Note 7.  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary.  The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  On the consolidated balance sheets, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.  The Company establishes a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a recorded tax benefit is not expected to be fully realized.  The expense to create the tax valuation allowance is recorded as an additional income tax expense in the period the tax valuation allowance is created.  The California capital loss carry-forward expired in 2015 unutilized; thus, the deferred balance as well as the related valuation allowance was written off as of   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes -   The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.  The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the reserve for uncertain tax positions attributable to tax deductions related to enterprise zone activities in California was   $301,000   and   $286,000  , respectively.  The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months. 

Note 8.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  .    These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets.  The contract or notional  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for loans. 
       Commitments to extend credit amounting to   $223,393,000   and   $217,166,000   were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract unless waived by the Bank.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. 
       Included in commitments to extend credit are undisbursed lines of credit totaling   $222,015,000   and   $215,952,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Undisbursed lines of credit include credits whereby customers can repay principal and request principal advances during the term of the loan at their discretion and most expire between one and 12 months. 
       Included in undisbursed lines of credit are commitments for the undisbursed portions of construction loans totaling   $32,126,000   and   $25,856,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These commitments are agreements to lend to customers, subject to meeting certain construction progress requirements established in the contracts.  The underlying construction loans have fixed expiration dates. 
       Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees amounting to   $1,378,000   and   $1,214,000   were outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements.  Most standby letters of credit and guarantees carry a one year term or less.  The fair value of the liability related to these standby letters of credit, which represents the fees received for their issuance, was not significant at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company recognizes these fees as revenue over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used. 
  The Company generally requires collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.  Management does not anticipate any material loss will result from the outstanding commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of a contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations was   $125,000   and  $150,000  , respectively.  The contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations is calculated by management using an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process.  While related to credit losses, this allocation is not a part of the allowance for credit losses and is considered separately as a liability for accounting and regulatory reporting purposes, and is included in Other Liabilities on the Company s balance sheet.   
       The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Company. 

Note 9. Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights settled in stock or restricted stock awards, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company.  A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine months   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , options to purchase   54,650   and   26,704   shares of common stock, respectively, were not factored into the calculation of dilutive stock options because they were anti-dilutive.  During the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , options to purchase   45,800   and   36,636   shares of common stock, respectively, were not factored into the calculation of dilutive stock options because they were anti-dilutive.    

Note 10.  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has three share-based compensation plans as described below.  Share-based compensation cost recognized for those plans was   $196,000   and   $184,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  For the quarters ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , share-based compensation was   $89,000   and   $61,000  , respectively.  The recognized tax benefits for the share based compensation expense was   $38,000   and   $11,000  , respectively, for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  For the quarters ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , recognized tax benefits were   $10,000   and   $1,000  , respectively.  
  The Central Valley Community Bancorp 2000 Stock Option Plan (2000 Plan) expired on November 15, 2010.  The Central Valley Community Bancorp 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) was adopted in May 2005 and expired March 16, 2015.  While outstanding arrangements to issue shares under these plans, including options, continue in force until their expiration, no new options will be granted under these plans. 
  The Central Valley Community Bancorp 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) was adopted in May 2015.  The plan provides for awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock.  The plan also allows for performance awards that may be in the form of cash or shares of the Company, including restricted stock.  Outstanding arrangements to issue shares under this plan including options, will continue in force until expiration according to their respective terms.   
     
  Stock Option Plan 
    
  The Company bases the fair value of the options granted on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions based on expected option life and the level of estimated forfeitures, expected stock volatility, risk free interest rate, and dividend yield.  The expected term and level of estimated forfeitures of the Company s options are based on the Company s own historical experience.  Stock volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.  The risk-free rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield curve for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of grant.  The compensation cost for options granted is based on the weighted average grant date fair value per share. 
       No options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock were granted during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

Information related to the stock option plan is as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $45,000   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under all plans.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   0.97   years.    No   options vested during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  Restricted Common Stock Awards 
    
  The 2005 and 2015 Plans provide for the issuance of restricted common stock to directors and officers.  Restricted common stock grants typically vest over a   five  -year period.  Restricted common stock (all of which are shares of our common stock) is subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting.  The cost of these awards is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. 
  The following table summarizes restricted stock activity for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as follows:  

During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   45,800   shares of restricted stock were granted compared to   none   during   2015  .  During the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   54,650   shares of restricted common stock were issued from outstanding grants under the 2005 and 2015 Plans.  The restricted common stock had a fair market value of   $14.10   per share on the date of issuance.  During the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  ,   9,268   shares of restricted common stock were issued from outstanding grants under the 2005 Plan.  The restricted common stock had a fair market value of   $12.95   per share on the date of issuance.  These restricted common stock awards vest   20%   after Year 1, and thereafter,   20%   of the remaining restricted stock will vest on each anniversary of the initial award commencement date and will be fully vested on the fifth such anniversary. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   93,621   shares of restricted stock that are nonvested and expected to vest.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $1,115,000   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted common stock awards.  Restricted stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  This cost is

     Table of Contents  

expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of   3.97   years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.  Restricted common stock awards had an intrinsic value of   $1,485,000   at   September 30, 2016  .   

Note 11.  Subsequent Events 
    
  Effective October 1, 2016, the Company and Sierra Vista Bank, headquartered in Folsom, California, completed a merger under which Sierra Vista Bank, with three full-service offices in Folsom and Fair Oaks (Sacramento County), and Cameron Park (El Dorado County), merged with and into Central Valley Community Bancorp s subsidiary, Central Valley Community Bank, in a combined cash and stock transaction.  Sierra Vista Bank s assets (unaudited) as of September 30, 2016 totaled approximately   $155 million  .  The acquired assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and will be reflected in the Company s December 31, 2016 financial statements.  The Company also expects to record goodwill and a core deposit intangible related to this transaction, but those amounts are not yet known as the initial fair value accounting is incomplete.  The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. 
  Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company issued   1,058,851   shares of its common stock and cash totaling approximately   $9.469 million   to the former shareholders of Sierra Vista Bank.

     Table of Contents  

Third Quarter of   2016    
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , our consolidated net income was   $3,114,000   compared to net income of   $2,517,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Diluted EPS was   $0.28   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.23   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in net income during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to a   decrease   in provision for credit losses, as well as an   increase   in net interest income and an   increase   in non-interest income, partially offset by an   increase   in non-interest expenses and an   increase   in provision for income taxes.  The Company recorded a reverse provision for credit losses of   $1,000,000   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a provision for credit losses of   $100,000   during the same period in   2015  .      Net interest income before the provision for credit losses   increase  d   $643,000   or   6.21%   comparing the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   to the same period in   2015  .   
  Net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was   4.01%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.01%   for the same period in   2015  .  The cost of deposits, calculated by dividing annualized interest expense on interest bearing deposits by total deposits, was   0.09%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.09%   for the same period in   2015  .   
  Non-interest income   increase  d   $413,000   or   23.98%   primarily due to an   increase   in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities of   $286,000  , a   $106,000     increase   in loan placement fees, and a   $43,000     increase   in service charge income, partially offset by a   $10,000     decrease   in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, and a   $16,000     decrease   in other income.  Non-interest expense   increase  d   $627,000   or   6.95%   for the same periods mainly due to increase in salaries and employee benefits, acquisition and integration expenses, directors  expenses, and data processing expenses, partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment expenses, regulatory assessment fees, professional services, and amortization of core deposit intangibles.   
  Annualized return on average equity for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   8.01%   compared to   7.47%   for the same period in   2015  .  Total average equity was   $155,595,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $134,709,000   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Notwithstanding an increase in shareholders  equity, this increase in ROE was achieved due to an   increase   in net income.  The Company declared and paid $  0.06   per share in cash dividends to holders of common stock during the   third   quarter of   2016  , consistent with   $0.06   in dividends declared and paid during the   third   quarter of   2015  .  
  Our average total assets   increase  d   $66,520,000   or   5.41%   to   $1,297,207,000   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Total average interest-earning assets   increase  d   $62,181,000   or   5.52%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  Average total loans, including nonaccrual loans,   increase  d   $26,556,000   or   4.44%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Average total investments and interest-earning deposits   increase  d   $32,621,000   or   6.18%   in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Average interest-bearing liabilities   increase  d   $31,807,000   or   4.69%   in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Average non-interest bearing demand deposits   increase  d   2.66%   to   $412,043,000   in   2016   compared to   $401,385,000   in   2015  .  The ratio of average non-interest bearing demand deposits to average total deposits was   36.88%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   37.35%   in   2015  . 
    
  First Nine Months of   2016    
    
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated net income was   $12,575,000   compared to   $8,061,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Diluted EPS was   $1.14   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $0.73   for the first   nine months   of   2015  .  Net income   increase  d   56.00%  , primarily driven by a reversal of the provision for credit losses of   $5,850,000  , as well as an   increase   in net interest income, which was partially offset by an   increase   in non-interest expenses, a   decrease   in non-interest income, and an   increase   in provision for income taxes in   2016   compared to   2015  .  During the   nine-month   period ended   September 30, 2016  , our net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis)   increase  d   four   basis points to   4.05%  .  Net interest income before the provision for credit losses   increase  d   $2,669,000   or   8.86%  .  Net interest income during the first   nine months   of 2016 and 2015 benefited by approximately   $501,000   and   $274,000  , respectively, from prepayment penalties and payoff of loans previously on nonaccrual status.  Excluding these benefits, net interest income for the first   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , increased by   $2,442,000   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Non-interest income   decrease  d   $155,000   or   2.06%  , and non-interest expense   increase  d   $995,000   or   3.68%   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   2015  .  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a reverse provision for credit losses of   $5,850,000   compared to   $600,000   provision during same period in   2015  . 
    
  Annualized return on average equity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   11.21%   compared to   8.01%   for the same period in   2015  .  Annualized return on average assets was   1.31%   and   0.89%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Total average equity was   $149,548,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $134,109,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in shareholders  equity was driven by the retention of earnings net of dividends paid, and an increase in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).

Average total investments (securities and interest-earning deposits)   increase  d   $36,597,000  , or   7.09%   in the   nine months   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , with average interest-bearing liabilities increasing $  25,244,000   or   3.73%   on a period to period comparison.   
    
  Our net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) for the first   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   4.05%   compared to   4.01%   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison resulted primarily from an   increase   in the yield on the Company s investment portfolio, an   increase   in the yield on the loan portfolio, and a   decrease   in the Company s cost of funds.  The effective yield on interest-earning assets   increase  d   four   basis points to   4.14%   for the   nine months   period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.10%   for the same period in   2015  .  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective yield on investment securities, including Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits in other banks,   increase  d   9   basis points, compared to the same period in the prior year, and the effective yield on loans   increase  d   three   basis points.  The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities   decrease  d   one   basis point to   0.15%   compared to   0.16%   for the same period in   2015  .  The cost of total deposits, including noninterest bearing accounts,   decrease  d   one   basis point to   0.08%   for the   nine months   ended   2016   compared to   0.09%   for the same period in   2015  .  The Company recorded other repossessed assets at their estimated realizable value of   $363,000   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  None were recorded as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $32,806,000   compared to   $30,137,000   for the same period in   2015  , an   increase   of   $2,669,000   or   8.86%  .  Net interest income   increase  d as a result of yield changes, asset mix changes, and an   increase   in average earning assets, partially offset by an   increase   in interest-bearing liabilities.  The Bank recovered   $501,000   and   $274,000  , of foregone interest income and prepaid payment penalties in   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling   $1,274,000   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2,413,000   at   December 31, 2015   and   $2,494,000   at   September 30, 2015  .  The Company had   no   other real estate owned at   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , or   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had total net loans of   $620,528,000  , total assets of   $1,307,775,000  , total deposits of   $1,127,497,000  , and shareholders  equity of   $156,322,000  .

  Key Factors in Evaluating Financial Condition and Operating Performance 
    
  As a publicly traded community bank holding company, we focus on several key factors including: 
    
                                                 Return to our shareholders; 
                                                 Return on average assets; 
                                                 Development of revenue streams, including net interest income and non-interest income; 
                                                 Asset quality; 
                                                 Asset growth; 
                                                 Capital adequacy; 
                                                 Operating efficiency; and 
                                                 Liquidity 
    
  Return to Our Shareholders 
    
  Our return to shareholders is determined in a ratio that measures the return on average equity (ROE).  Our annualized ROE was   11.21%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   8.12%   for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and   8.01%   for the annualized   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our net income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d   $4,514,000   or   56.00%   to   $12,575,000   compared to   $8,061,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by a   decrease   in provision for credit losses, as well as an   increase   in net interest income, offset by an   increase   in provision for income taxes and an   increase   in non-interest expenses.  Net interest margin (NIM)   increase  d   four   basis points comparing the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  Diluted EPS was   $1.14   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $0.73   for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Return on Average Assets 
    
  Our return on average assets (ROA) is a ratio that we use to compare our performance with other banks and bank holding companies.  Our annualized ROA for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   1.31%   compared to   0.90%   for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and   0.89%   for the annualized   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in ROA compared to December   2015   is due to the increase in net income, notwithstanding an increase in average assets.  Average assets for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,276,214,000   compared to   $1,222,526,000   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  ROA for our peer group was 1.16% for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our peer group from SNL Financial data includes certain bank holding companies in central California with assets from $600 million to $2.5 billion. 
    
  Development of Revenue Streams 
    
  Over the past several years, we have focused on not only improving net income, but improving the consistency of our revenue streams in order to create more predictable future earnings and reduce the effect of changes in our operating environment on our net income.  Specifically, we have focused on net interest income through a variety of processes, including increases in average interest earning assets, and minimizing the effects of the continuing declines in interest rates on our net interest margin.  The Company s net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was   4.05%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   4.01%   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   in net interest margin is principally due to continued growth in earning assets in a low interest rate and competitive economic environment.  The Company s net interest margin was positively impacted by the   decrease   in our rates on interest-bearing liabilities; more specifically, the increase in the yield on the Company s loan portfolio, the increase in the yield on the Company s investment portfolio, and a decrease in the Company s cost of funds.  In comparing the two periods, the effective yield on total earning assets   increase  d   four   basis points, while the cost of total interest bearing liabilities   decrease  d   one   basis point and the cost of total deposits   decrease  d   one   basis point.  The Company s total cost of deposits for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.08%   compared to   0.09%   for the same period in   2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  ,   36.86%   of the Company s average total deposits were non-interest bearing compared to 32.73% for the Company s peer group as of December 31, 2015.  Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the   nine months   period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $32,806,000   compared to   $30,137,000   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Our non-interest income is generally made up of service charges and fees on deposit accounts, fee income from loan placements and other services, appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, and net gains from sales of  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

investment securities.  Non-interest income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $155,000   or   2.06%  , to   $7,353,000   compared to   $7,508,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   decrease   resulted primarily from decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, service charge income, loan placement fees, and the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by increases in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities compared to the comparable   2015   period.  Further detail of non-interest income is provided below. 
    
  Asset Quality 
    
  For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality has a significant impact on the overall financial condition and results of operations.  Asset quality is measured in terms of percentage of total loans and total assets and is a key element in estimating the future earnings of a company.  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (OREO), and repossessed assets.  Nonperforming loans are those loans which have (i) been placed on nonaccrual status; (ii) been classified as doubtful under our asset classification system; or (iii) become contractually past due 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest and have not been restructured or otherwise placed on nonaccrual status.  A loan is classified as nonaccrual when 1) it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower; 2) payment in full of principal or interest under the original contractual terms is not expected; or 3) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. 
  The Company had non-performing loans totaling   $1,274,000   or   0.20%   of total loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2,413,000   or   0.40%   of total loans at   December 31, 2015  .  Management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower (less than 30 days delinquent) on nonaccrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in future periods and collectability has been reasonably assured.  The Company had   no   other real estate owned (OREO) at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company recorded   $363,000   in repossessed assets at   September 30, 2016   versus none at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company s ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was   0.13%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   0.19%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Asset Growth 
    
  As revenues from both net interest income and non-interest income are a function of asset size, the growth in assets has a direct impact in increasing net income.  The majority of our assets are loans and investment securities, and the majority of our liabilities are deposits, and therefore the ability to generate deposits as a funding source for loans and investments is fundamental to our asset growth.  Total assets   increase  d by   $31,039,000   or   2.43%   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $1,307,775,000   compared to   $1,276,736,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Total gross loans   increase  d by   5.30%   or   $31,716,000   to   $629,827,000   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $598,111,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Total deposits   increase  d   1.01%   to   $1,127,497,000   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,116,267,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Our loan to deposit ratio at   September 30, 2016   was   55.86%   compared to   53.58%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The loan to deposit ratio of our peers was 75.73% at December 31, 2015.  Further discussion of loans and deposits is below. 
    
  Capital Adequacy 
    
  Capital serves as a source of funds and helps protect depositors and shareholders against potential losses.  The Company has historically maintained substantial levels of capital.  The assessment of capital adequacy is dependent on several factors including asset quality, earnings trends, liquidity and economic conditions.  Maintenance of adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the Company.  The Company needs to maintain substantial levels of regulatory capital to give it flexibility in the changing regulatory environment and to respond to changes in the market and economic conditions including acquisition opportunities. 
  The Company and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on our financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures.  These measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank were considered  well capitalized  under this regulatory framework.  The Company s regulatory capital ratios are presented in the table in the     Capital     section below.   
    
  Operating Efficiency 
    
  Operating efficiency is the measure of how efficiently earnings before provision for credit losses and taxes are generated as a percentage of revenue.  A lower ratio is more favorable.  The Company s efficiency ratio (operating expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles and foreclosed property expense, divided by net interest income before provision for credit losses (computed on a tax equivalent basis) plus non-interest income, excluding gains and losses from sales of securities and OREO, and  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

gains related to the collection of life insurance proceeds) was   68.65%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   69.93%   for the first   nine months   of   2015  .  The improvement in the efficiency ratio is due to the growth in revenues outpacing the growth in non-interest expense.  Further discussion of the change in net interest income and   increase   in operating expenses is below. 
  The Company s net interest income before provision for credit losses on a non tax-equivalent basis plus non-interest income, net of OREO related gains, investment securities related gains, and gain related to the collection of life insurance proceeds,   increase  d   6.46%   to   $40,680,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $38,213,000   for the same period in   2015  , while operating expenses, net of OREO related expenses, loss on sale of assets and amortization of core deposit intangibles,   increase  d   4.51%   to   $27,926,000   from   $26,722,000   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations, which include providing for customers  credit needs, funding of securities purchases, and ongoing repayment of borrowings.  Our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by our management and Directors  Asset/Liability Committee.  This process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet our funding needs, including adequate cash flow for off-balance sheet commitments.  Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and, to a lesser extent, broker deposits, Federal funds facilities and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB).  We have available unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling approximately   $40,000,000   and secured borrowing lines of approximately   $322,592,000   with the FHLB.  These funding sources are augmented by collection of principal and interest on loans, the routine maturities and pay downs of securities from our investment securities portfolio, the stability of our core deposits, and the ability to sell investment securities.  Primary uses of funds include origination and purchases of loans, withdrawals of and interest payments on deposits, purchases of investment securities, and payment of operating expenses. 
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Net Income for the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015  : 
    
  Net income   increase  d to   $12,575,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8,061,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Basic and diluted earnings per share for   September 30, 2016   were   $1.15   and   $1.14  , respectively.  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the same period in   2015   were   $0.74   and   $0.73  , respectively.  Annualized ROE was   11.21%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   8.01%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Annualized ROA for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   1.31%  . and   0.89%  , respectively.  
    
  The   increase   in net income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   can be attributed primarily to a   decrease   in provision for credit losses, as well as an   increase   in net interest income, partially offset by an   increase   in non-interest expense, an   increase   in provision for income taxes and a   decrease   in non-interest income.  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a reverse provision for credit losses of   $5,850,000  , compared to a   $600,000   provision during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .      The   decrease   in non-interest income was primarily driven by decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, service charge income, loan placement fees, and the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by increases in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities compared to the comparable   2015   period.  The Company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $136,000 during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .      Non-interest expense   increase  d   $995,000  or   3.68%   for the same periods mainly due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, data processing expenses, acquisition and integration expenses, directors  expenses, telephone expenses, and ATM/Debit card expenses, offset by decreases in regulatory assessments, professional services, Internet banking, occupancy and equipment expenses, and license and maintenance contracts.  Further discussion of non-interest expenses is below. 
    
  Interest Income and Expense 
    
  Net interest income is the most significant component of our income from operations.  Net interest income (the  interest rate spread ) is the difference between the gross interest and fees earned on the loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings.  Net interest income depends on the volume of and interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the volume of and interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. 
  The following table sets forth a summary of average balances with corresponding interest income and interest expense as well as average yield and cost information for the periods presented.  Average balances are derived from daily balances, and nonaccrual loans are not included as interest earning assets for purposes of this table.

The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates for the periods indicated.  The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the change in rate. 

(1)    Computed on a tax equivalent basis for securities exempt from federal income taxes. 
    
  Interest and fee income from loans   increase  d   $1,531,000   or   6.75%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Net interest income during the first   nine months   of   2016   was positively impacted by an increase in average total loans in 2016, increasing by $  27,348,000   or   4.67%   to   $613,381,000   compared to $  586,033,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The yield on average loans, excluding nonaccrual loans, was   5.29%   for the   nine months   ended   2016   as compared to   5.26%   for the same period in   2015  .  Net interest income was positively impacted by receipt of nonrecurring income from prepayment penalties and payoff of nonaccrual loans by approximately   $501,000   and   $274,000   during the first   nine months   in   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We have been successful in implementing interest rate floors on many of our adjustable rate loans to partially offset the effects of the historically low prime interest rate experienced over the last few years.  The loan floors will cause net interest margin pressure in certain rising interest rate scenarios.  We are committed to providing our customers with competitive pricing without sacrificing strong asset quality and value to our shareholders. 
  Interest income from total investments on a non tax-equivalent basis (total investments include investment securities, Federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits with other banks, and other securities)   increase  d   $1,125,000   in the first   nine months   of   2016   to   $9,376,000   compared to   $8,251,000  , for the same period in   2015  .  The yield on average total investments (total securities and interest-earning deposits)   increase  d   nine   basis points to   2.84%   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2.75%   for the same period in   2015  .  Average total securities and interest-earning deposits for the first   nine months   of   2016     increase  d   $36,597,000   or   7.09%   to   $552,840,000   compared to   $516,243,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Income from investments represents   28.58%   of net interest income for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   27.38%   for the same period in   2015  .   
  In an effort to increase yields, without accepting unreasonable risk, a significant portion of the investment purchases have been in residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).  At   September 30, 2016  , we held   $252,925,000   or   45.90%   of the total fair value of the investment portfolio in MBS and CMOs with an average yield of   1.95%  .  We invest in CMOs and MBS as part of our overall strategy to increase our net interest margin.  CMOs and MBS by their nature react to changes in interest rates.  In a normal declining rate environment, prepayments from MBS and CMOs would be expected to increase and the expected life of the investment would be expected to shorten.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, prepayments normally would be expected to decline and the average life of the MBS and CMOs would be expected to extend.  However, in the current economic environment, prepayments may not behave according to historical norms.  Premium

amortization and discount accretion of these investments affects our net interest income.  Management monitors the prepayment speed of these investments and adjusts premium amortization and discount accretion based on several factors.  These factors include the type of investment, the investment structure, interest rates, interest rates on new mortgage loans, expectation of interest rate changes, current economic conditions, the level of principal remaining on the bond, the bond coupon rate, the bond origination date, and volume of available bonds in market.  The calculation of premium amortization and discount accretion is by nature inexact, and represents management s best estimate of principal pay downs inherent in the total investment portfolio. 
  The net-of-tax unrealized gain on the investment portfolio was   $10,450,000   at   September 30, 2016   and is reflected in the Company s equity.  At   September 30, 2016  , the average life of the investment portfolio was   5.69   years and the fair value of the portfolio reflected a net pre-tax unrealized gain of   $18,031,000  .  Management reviews fair value declines on individual investment securities to determine whether they represent an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI).  Refer to    Note 3      of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more detail.  The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $136,000 during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  Additional deterioration in the market values of our investment securities, if any, may require the Company to recognize OTTI losses in future periods. 
  A component of the Company s strategic plan has been to use its investment portfolio to offset, in part, its interest rate risk relating to variable rate loans.  At   September 30, 2016  , an immediate rate increase of 200 basis points would result in an estimated decrease in the market value of the investment portfolio by approximately   $(34,015,000)  .  Conversely, with an immediate rate decrease of 200 basis points, the estimated increase in the market value of the investment portfolio would be   $26,700,000  .  The modeling environment assumes management would take no action during an immediate shock of 200 basis points.  However, the Company uses those increments to measure its interest rate risk in accordance with regulatory requirements and risk tolerance policy limits established by the Board of Directors to measure the possible future risk in the investment portfolio.   
  Management s review of all investments before purchase includes an analysis of how the security will perform under several interest rate scenarios to monitor whether investments are consistent with our investment policy.  The policy addresses issues of average life, duration, concentration guidelines, prohibited investments, impairment, and prohibited practices. 
  Total interest income on a non-tax equivalent basis for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d   $2,656,000   or   8.59%   to   $33,584,000   compared to   $30,928,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The yield on interest earning assets   increase  d   four   basis points to   4.14%   on a fully tax equivalent basis for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   4.10%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the   increase   in yields on investment securities and loans.  Average interest earning assets   increase  d to   $1,168,597,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,097,409,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $71,188,000     increase   in average earning assets can be attributed to the   $34,576,000   or   6.00%   increase in average loans and the   $36,597,000     increase   in average investments. 
  Interest expense on deposits for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $28,000   or   3.90%   to   $690,000   compared to   $718,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   in interest expense was primarily due to repricing of interest bearing deposits.  The average interest rate on interest bearing deposits   decrease  d   one   basis point to   0.13%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   0.14%   in   2015   as a result of the ongoing low interest rate environment.  Average interest-bearing deposits   increase  d   3.76%   or   $25,245,000   to   $696,899,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $671,654,000   for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Average other borrowed funds   decrease  d   $1,000   or   0.02%   to   $5,155,000   with an effective rate of   2.28%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5,156,000   with an effective rate of   1.89%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Total interest expense on other borrowed funds was   $88,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $73,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other borrowings include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), advances on available unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures.  The debentures were acquired in the merger with Service 1st and carry a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.60%.  The rates were   2.28%   and   1.88%   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  See the section on Financial Condition for more detail. 
  The cost of our interest-bearing liabilities   decrease  d   one   basis point to   0.15%   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.16%   for   2015  .  The cost of total deposits   decrease  d to   0.08%   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.09%   for same period in   2015  .

Net Interest Income before Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increase  d by   $2,669,000   or   8.86%   to   $32,806,000   compared to   $30,137,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The   increase   was a result of yield changes, an increase in average earning assets, asset mix changes, partially offset by a   one   basis point   decrease   in the average interest rate on interest bearing deposits, and an   increase   in average interest bearing liabilities.  Average interest earning assets were   $1,168,597,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   with a net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) of   4.05%   compared to   $1,097,409,000   with a net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) of   4.01%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $71,188,000     increase   in average earning assets can be attributed to the   $34,576,000   or   6.00%     increase   in average loans, and the   $36,597,000     increase   in average total investments.  Average interest bearing liabilities   increase  d   3.73%   to   $702,054,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $676,810,000   for the same period in   2015  .  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective yield on investment securities including Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits in other banks   increase  d   nine   basis points.  The effective yield on loans   increase  d   three   basis points.

  Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  We provide for probable incurred credit losses through a charge to operating income based upon the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency levels, historical losses, nonperforming asset levels, economic and environmental conditions and other factors which, in management s judgment, deserve recognition in estimating credit losses.  Loans are charged off when they are considered uncollectible or when continuance as an active earning bank asset is not warranted. 
  The establishment of an adequate credit allowance is based on both an accurate risk rating system and loan portfolio management tools.  The Board has established initial responsibility for the accuracy of credit risk grades with the individual credit officer.  The grading is then submitted to the Chief Credit Officer (CCO), who reviews the grades for accuracy and gives final approval.  The CCO is not involved in loan originations.  The risk grading and reserve allocation is analyzed quarterly by the Senior Risk Manager, CCO, Chief Financial Officer, and Board; and at least annually by a third party credit reviewer and by various regulatory agencies. 
  Quarterly, the Senior Risk Manager and the CCO set the specific reserve for all adversely risk-graded credits.  This process includes the utilization of loan delinquency reports, classified asset reports, and portfolio concentration reports to assist in accurately assessing credit risk and establishing appropriate reserves.  Reserves are also allocated to credits that are not impaired based on inherent risk in those loans. 
  The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the Board s Audit/Compliance Committee and by the Board of Directors.  Reserves are allocated to loan portfolio categories using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as delinquencies and losses and predictive risk elements such as economic, competitive and environmental factors.  We have adopted the specific reserve approach to allocate reserves to each impaired credit for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure.  Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated to various portfolio categories, it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety.  Changes in the allowance for credit losses may be required based on the results of independent loan portfolio examinations, regulatory agency examinations, or our own internal review process.  Adjustments are also required when, in management s judgment, the allowance does not properly reflect the portfolio s probable loss exposure.  Management believes that all adjustments, if any, to the allowance for credit losses are supported by the timely and consistent application of methodologies and processes resulting in detailed documentation of the allowance calculation and other portfolio trending analysis.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is set forth below:  

Loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loans are deemed uncollectible.  It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance so that it remains adequate to cover all probable incurred credit losses that exist in the portfolio at that time.  We assign qualitative and environmental factors (Q factors) to each loan category.  Q factors include reserves held for the effects of lending policies, economic trends, and portfolio trends along with other dynamics which may cause additional stress to the portfolio. 
  Managing credits identified through the risk evaluation methodology includes developing a business strategy with the customer to mitigate our potential losses.  Management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when, and to what extent, additional provisions may be necessary.   While the overall level of loans with an internal risk rating of substandard has increased by $8.0 million or 25% to $39.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $31.8 million at December 31, 2015, the classification of those loans has migrated from Agricultural land and production to Agricultural real estate.  Management believes that the additional collateral obtained related to these classified assets provides the Company with a reduced risk of loss if a default event was to occur.  In addition, the level of commercial and industrial loans graded special mention or worse have substantially declined from $24.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $13.5 million at September 30, 2016.  Therefore, the level of allowance for loan losses allocated to Commercial and Real estate loans has been adjusted accordingly. 
   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a reverse provision for credit losses of   $5,850,000   compared to provision of   $600,000   during   2015  .  The reversal from the allowance for credit losses is primarily the result of   $5,539,000   in net loan loss recoveries and our assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considering a number of factors as discussed in the  Allowance for Credit Losses  section.   
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had net recoveries totaling   $5,539,000   compared to net recoveries of   $185,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The majority of the loans charged off were previously classified and sufficient specific reserves related to these impaired credits were held in the allowance for credit losses in reporting periods prior to the date of charge-off.   
  Nonperforming loans were   $1,274,000   and   $2,413,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and   $2,494,000   at   September 30, 2015  .  Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans were   0.20%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.40%   at   December 31, 2015   and   0.42%   at   September 30, 2015  .   The Company had   no   other real estate owned (OREO) at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company recorded   $363,000   in repossessed assets at   September 30, 2016   versus none at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The annualized net charge-off (recovery) ratio, which reflects net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans was   (1.20)%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , and   (0.04)%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Notwithstanding improvements in the economy, we anticipate some weakness in economic conditions on national, state, and local levels to continue.  Continued economic pressures may negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the Company has extended credit and as a result we may be required to make further significant provisions to the allowance for credit losses in the future.  Many farmers and ranchers have instituted improved farming practices including planting less acreage, as part of the mitigation for the cost of water delivery and the expense of pumping.  We continue to closely monitor the water and other related issues affecting our customers.  We have been and will continue to be proactive in looking for signs of deterioration

within the loan portfolio in an effort to manage credit quality and work with borrowers where possible to mitigate any further losses.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $39.8 million   in classified loans of which   $27.1 million   related to agricultural real estate,   $5.9 million   to commercial and industrial loans,   $2.3 million   to real estate construction, and   $1.8 million   to commercial agricultural loans.  This compares to $31.8 million in classified loans as of December 31, 2015 of which $8.5 million related to agricultural real estate, $1.8 million to commercial and industrial, $10.1 million to agricultural land and production, and $4.7 million to commercial real estate.  The reduction in classified agricultural land and production loans relates to the refinance of a single loan which is now secured by agricultural real estate.  This increase in classified agricultural real estate relates primarily to a single borrower with multiple loans totaling approximately $21.3 million which continues to perform under the terms of the loan agreements, while management has observed and continues to monitor some indications of deterioration in the borrower s overall financial condition.  These changes in classified loans contributed to the shift in the amount of allowance for credit losses allocated between commercial loans and real estate loans. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe, based on all current and available information, the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio.  However, no assurance can be given that we may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.  Refer to the  Allowance for Credit Losses  section for further information. 
    
  Net Interest Income after Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  Net interest income, after the provision for credit losses, was   $38,656,000   for the   nine months   period ended   September 30, 2016   and   $29,537,000   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Non-Interest Income 
    
  Non-interest income is comprised of customer service charges, loan placement fees, net gains on sales and calls of investment securities, appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, and other income.  Non-interest income was   $7,353,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7,508,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The   $155,000   or   2.06%     decrease   in non-interest income was primarily due to a   $160,000     decrease   in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, a   $94,000     decrease   in customer service charges, a   $2,000     decrease   in loan placement fees, a   $112,000     decrease   in other income, and a   decrease   in appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance of   $40,000  , partially offset by an   increase   of   $377,000   in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, and a   $23,000     increase   in interchange fees.      The Company realized tax-free gains of $190,000 and $345,000 related to the collection of life insurance proceeds in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of   $136,000   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we realized a net gain on sales and calls of investment securities of   $1,836,000   compared to   $1,459,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The net gains realized on sales and calls of investment securities in   2016   and   2015   were the result of a partial restructuring of the investment portfolio designed to improve the future performance of the portfolio.   
  Customer service charges   decrease  d   $94,000   or   4.05%   to   $2,227,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $2,321,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in service charges was the result of lower NSF fees and lower analysis fees.  Loan placement fees   decrease  d   $2,000   or   0.25%   to   $792,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $794,000   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in mortgage refinances.  Interchange fees   increase  d   $23,000   to   $904,000   first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $881,000   for the same period in   2015  .   
  The Bank holds stock from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco in conjunction with our borrowing capacity and generally earns quarterly dividends.  We currently hold   $4,823,000   in FHLB stock.  We received dividends totaling   $314,000   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $474,000   for the same period in   2015  .

  Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, regulatory assessments, professional services, license and maintenance contracts, Internet banking, and data processing are the major categories of non-interest expenses.  Non-interest expenses   increase  d   $995,000   or   3.68%   to   $28,008,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $27,013,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The net   increase   in   2016   was a result of increases in salaries and employee benefits of   $832,000  , acquisition and integration expenses of   $515,000  , data processing expenses of   $283,000  ,  directors  expenses of   $158,000  , and ATM/Debit card expenses of   $58,000  , partially offset by decreases in regulatory assessments of   $352,000  , professional services of   $241,000  , Internet banking expenses of   $44,000  , occupancy and equipment expenses of   $11,000  , license and maintenance contracts of   $4,000  , and other non-interest expenses of   $18,000    
  The Company s efficiency ratio, measured as the percentage of non-interest expenses (exclusive of amortization of core deposit intangible assets and foreclosure expenses) to net interest income before provision for credit losses (calculated on

     Table of Contents  

a fully tax equivalent basis) plus non-interest income (exclusive of net realized gains on sales and calls of investments, OREO related gains and losses, and gains related to the collection of life insurance proceeds) was   68.65%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   69.93%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .   
  Salaries and employee benefits   increase  d   $832,000   or   5.38%   to   $16,304,000   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to   $15,472,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  Full time equivalent employees were   268   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   270   at   September 30, 2015  .  The increase of salaries and employee benefits in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is a result of higher overall salary and benefit expenses.  However, direct loan origination costs including salaries and employee benefits, which are capitalized and expensed as an adjustment to interest and fees on loans increased during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
  Occupancy and equipment expense   decrease  d   $11,000   or   0.31%   to   $3,511,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3,522,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company made no changes in its depreciation expense methodology.  The Company incurred exit expenses of approximately $146,000 related to the closure of the Sunnyside Branch during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .   
  Data processing expense   increase  d to   $1,145,000   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $862,000   for the same period in   2015  .

  Regulatory assessments   decrease  d to   $469,000   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $821,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The assessment base for calculating the amount owed is average assets minus average tangible equity.  The higher assessment rate in 2015 which was a result of changes in credit quality ratios used in determining the assessment rate along with higher average assets.  In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule revising DIF assessment formulas which will result in lower assessments for the Company.  The assessments are expected to drop by an average of approximately one-third.   
  Professional services   decrease  d by   $241,000   in the first nine months of   2016   due to lower legal and consulting fees.

Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective income tax rate was   30.14%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   19.65%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Company reported an income tax provision of   $5,426,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,971,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the effective tax rate during   2016   was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income while permanent tax adjustments in 2016 remained consistent with the 2015 amounts.  The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain income taxes where the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained upon examination do not meet a more-likely-than-not criteria.   
  The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the reserve for uncertain

tax positions attributable to tax credits and deductions related to enterprise zone activities in California was   $301,000   and   $286,000  , respectively.  The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next 12 months.

Net Income for the   Third   Quarter of   2016   Compared to the   Third   Quarter of   2015  : 
    
  Net income was   $3,114,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2,517,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Basic earnings per share was   $0.28   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $0.23   for the same period in   2015  .  Diluted earnings per share was $  0.28   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  0.23   for the same period in   2015    Annualized ROE was   8.01%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   7.47%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Annualized ROA for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.96%   compared to   0.82%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The   increase   in net income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a   decrease   in provision for credit losses, an   increase   in net interest income, and an   increase   in non-interest income, partially offset by an   increase   in non-interest expense, and an   increase   in the provision for income taxes.  The Company recorded   $1,000,000   reverse provision for credit losses during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to provision for credit losses of   $100,000   during the same period in   2015  .  Non-interest income   increase  d primarily due to an   increase   of   $286,000   in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, an   increase   in service charges of   $43,000  , and an   increase   in interchange fees of   $15,000  , partially offset by a   decrease   in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends of   $10,000  , a   decrease   in appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance of   $11,000  , and a   decrease   in other income of   $16,000  .

Yield on the loan portfolio was   5.18%   and   5.18%   for the   third   quarters ending   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  Net interest income during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   benefited by approximately   $10,000   and   $49,000  , respectively, in nonrecurring income from prepayment penalties and payoff of loans previously on nonaccrual status.  We have been successful in implementing interest rate floors on many of our adjustable rate loans to partially offset the effects of the historically low prime interest rate experienced over the last two years.  We are committed to providing our customers with competitive pricing without sacrificing strong asset quality and value to our shareholders.

The cost of deposits, calculated by dividing annualized interest expense on interest bearing deposits by total deposits, was   0.09%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.09%   for the same period in   2015  .  Average interest bearing deposits   increase  d   4.72%   or   $31,807,000   comparing the   third   quarter of   2016   to the same period in   2015  .  Average interest-bearing deposits were   $705,080,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , with an effective rate paid of   0.14%  , compared to   $673,273,000   for the same period in   2015  , with an effective rate paid of   0.14%  .

As a result, interest expense on borrowed funds   increase  d   $5,000   to   $30,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $25,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other borrowings are comprised entirely of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures.  The debentures were acquired in the merger with Service 1st and carry a floating rate based on the three month Libor plus a margin of 1.60%.  The rates were   2.28%   and   1.88%   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  See the section on Financial Condition for more detail. 
    
  The cost of our interest bearing liabilities was   0.15%   and    0.16%   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The cost of total deposits was   0.09%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.09%   for quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Net Interest Income before Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  ,   increase  d   $643,000   or   6.21%   to   $10,995,000   compared to   $10,352,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   was due to the   increase   in average interest earning assets, asset mix changes, partially offset by an   increase   in average interest-bearing liabilities.  Our net interest margin remained unchanged.  Average interest earning assets were   $1,188,105,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) of   4.01%   compared to   $1,125,924,000   with a net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) of   4.01%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $62,181,000     increase   in average earning assets can be attributed to a   $26,556,000     increase   in loans, and the   $32,621,000     increase   in total investments.  Average interest bearing liabilities   increase  d   4.69%   to   $710,235,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $678,428,000   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  The Company recorded a   $1,000,000   reverse provision for credit losses during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a provision for credit losses of   $100,000   during the same period of   2015  .  The decision to record the provision adjustments to the allowance for credit losses in either period is primarily the result of our assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considering a number of factors as discussed in the  Allowance for Credit Losses  section.  The annualized net charge-off (recovery) ratio, which reflects net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans, was   (0.27)%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   (0.19)%   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had recoveries totaling   $427,000   compared to net recoveries of   $279,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Gross recoveries of previously charged off loan balances during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $957,000   and   $312,000  , respectively. Gross charge-offs during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $530,000   and   $33,000  , respectively. The majority of the loans charged off were previously classified and sufficient specific reserves related to these impaired credits were held in the allowance for credit losses in reporting periods prior to the date of charge-off.   
    
  Non-Interest Income 
    
  Non-interest income is comprised primarily of customer service charges, loan placement fees and other service fees, net gains on sales of investments and assets, FHLB stock dividends, and other income.  Non-interest income was   $2,135,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,722,000   for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $413,000   or   23.98%     increase   in non-interest income for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a   $286,000     increase   in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, a   $43,000     increase   in service charge income, and a   $15,000     increase   in interchange fees, partially offset by a   $10,000     decrease   in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, and a   $11,000     decrease   in appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance.

Customer service charges   increase  d   $43,000   or   6.14%   to   $743,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $700,000   for the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a decrease in overdraft and analysis fee income.  Other income   decrease  d   $16,000   or   7.21%   to   $206,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $222,000   for the same period in   2015  .   
    
  Non-Interest Expenses 
    
  Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, regulatory assessments, data processing, Internet banking, license and maintenance contracts, and professional services are the major categories of non-interest expenses.  Non-interest expenses   increase  d   $627,000   or   6.95%   to   $9,655,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9,028,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Consistent with the changes discussed above for the   nine-month   periods, the net   increase   quarter over quarter was a result of   increase  s in salaries and employee benefits of   $354,000  ,   increase  s in acquisition and integration expenses of   $363,000  ,   increase  s in data processing expenses of   $103,000  ,   increase  s in ATM/Debit card expenses of   $14,000  , and   increase  s in Internet banking of   $3,000  , partially offset by,   decrease  s in occupancy and equipment of   $80,000  ,   decrease  s in regulatory assessments of   $89,000  , and   decrease  s in professional fees of   $49,000  .   
    
  The Company s efficiency ratio, measured as the percentage of non-interest expenses (exclusive of amortization of core deposit intangible assets) to net interest income before provision for credit losses (calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis) plus non-interest income (excluding net gains from sales of securities and assets and gains on collection of insurance proceeds), increased to   70.41%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   69.36%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
    
  Salaries and employee benefits   increase  d   $354,000   or   6.74%   to   $5,608,000   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $5,254,000   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The   increase   in salaries and employee benefits for the   third   quarter of   2016   can be attributed to a higher incentive expenses and deferred compensation interest expense.  The number of full time equivalent employees as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015   was   270  ,   273  , and   271  , respectively.  The salaries and employee benefits increase can also be attributed to higher 401K match expense, higher profit sharing accrual expense, higher compensation expense related to restricted stock issues, offset by lower health insurance expense, and higher loan origination costs recognized.   
    
  Other non-interest expenses included increases of   $32,000   in credit card processing expenses,   $18,000   in education/training expenses,   $14,000   in appraisal expenses,  $14,000   in donations, and $  2,000   in armored courier expense, partially offset by decreases of $  13,000   in telephone expenses, $  4,000   in postage fees,   $2,000   in check printing expense, and $  2,000   in software amortization, as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax rate was   30.41%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   14.56%   for the same period in   2015  .  Provision for income taxes totaled   $1,361,000   and   $429,000   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to an increase in pre-tax income while permanent tax adjustments in 2016 remained consistent with the 2015 amounts.

Fair Value 
    
  The Company measures the fair values of its financial instruments utilizing a hierarchical framework associated with the level of observable pricing scenarios utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value.  The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of the observable pricing scenario.  Financial instruments with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of observable pricing and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no observable pricing and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  Observable pricing scenarios are impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction.  See    Note 2    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value. 
    
  Investments 
    
  Our investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by residential mortgage backed obligations and obligations of states and political subdivision securities and are classified at the date of acquisition as available for sale or held to maturity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , investment securities with a fair value of   $110,723,000  , or   20.09%   of our investment securities portfolio, were held as collateral for public funds, short and long-term borrowings, treasury, tax, and for other purposes.  Our investment policies are established by the Board of Directors and implemented by management.  They are designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, to enable us to meet our pledging requirements for public money and borrowing arrangements, to generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to complement our lending activities. 
  The level of our investment portfolio as a percentage of our total earning assets is generally considered higher than our peers due primarily to a comparatively low loan to deposit ratio.  Our loan to deposit ratio at   September 30, 2016   was   55.86%   compared to   53.58%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The loan to deposit ratio of our peers was 75.73% at December 31, 2015.  The total investment portfolio, including Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits in other banks,   decrease  d   1.32%   or   $7,665,000   to   $572,879,000   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $580,544,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio reflected a net unrealized gain of   $18,031,000   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a net unrealized gain of   $7,474,000   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The board and management have had many discussions about our strategy for risk management in dealing with potential losses should interest rates begin to rise.  Since June 2013, we have been managing the portfolio with an objective of minimizing the risk of rising interest rates on the fair value of the overall portfolio.  We have restructured the portfolio a few times by selling off securities and investing in variable rate securities with shorter duration.   
  During the first quarter of 2014, the Company reclassified $31.3 million of investment securities as held-to-maturity (HTM) from available-for-sale (AFS), based on a strategic risk management analysis performed by management and agreed to by the Company s Audit Committee and Board of Directors.  The analysis performed by management concluded that the Company had the positive intent to hold a block of forty municipal debt securities to maturity based principally on our asset/liability management strategies and our strategic risk management analysis.  As of the date of transfer during the first quarter of 2014, the AFS securities transferred to HTM had a fair value of $31.3 million including net unrealized gains of $0.2 million.  This 2014 transaction represented the first time the Company had designated certain investment securities as HTM.  At the time of the HTM designation and through December 31, 2015, the Company had both the intent and the ability to hold the designated HTM securities to maturity.  The quarterly interest rate risk analysis prepared by management during the remainder of 2014 and 2015 consistently identified the securities as HTM and illustrated how they provided balance to management s overall interest rate risk strategies. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, management sold certain investment securities with a book value of approximately $23.0 million in a routine restructuring of the investment portfolio.  Through the proper operation of the Company s internal control process related to investment securities, management discovered after the transaction settled that five of the 13 securities sold were previously designated as HTM.  Through an oversight during the portfolio restructuring analysis related to this transaction, management unintentionally sold these five HTM securities.  At the time of the HTM designation and through December 31, 2015, the Company had both the intent and the ability to hold the designated HTM securities to maturity.  The book value of the HTM securities sold was $8.5 million.  The gain realized on the sale of the HTM securities was $696,000.  As required and as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the remaining HTM securities were reclassified to AFS designation, which also resulted in $1,783,000 increase to accumulated other comprehensive income in Shareholders  Equity.   
    We periodically evaluate each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment, relying primarily on industry analyst reports, observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations.  The portion of the impairment that is attributable to a shortage in the present value of expected future cash flows relative to the amortized cost should be recorded as a current period charge to earnings.  The discount rate in this analysis is the original yield expected at time of purchase.

Management evaluated all available-for-sale investment securities with an unrealized loss at   September 30, 2016   and identified those that had an unrealized loss for at least a consecutive 12 month period, which had an unrealized loss at   September 30, 2016   greater than 10% of the recorded book value on that date, or which had an unrealized loss of more than $10,000.  Management also analyzed any securities that may have been downgraded by credit rating agencies.  
  For those bonds that met the evaluation criteria, management obtained and reviewed the most recently published national credit ratings for those bonds.  For those bonds that were obligations of states and political subdivisions with an investment grade rating by the rating agencies, management also evaluated the financial condition of the municipality and any applicable municipal bond insurance provider and concluded that $136,000 credit related impairment existed.  The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $136,000 during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   17   U.S. Government agency securities, of which   6   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   two   was in a loss position and had been in a loss position for 12 months or more.  The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate changes.  The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized costs of the investment.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell, those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   158   obligations of states and political subdivision securities of which   13   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   none   were in a loss position and had been in a loss position for 12 months or more.    The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in obligations of states and political subdivision securities were caused by interest rate changes.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability to hold and does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   168   U.S. Government sponsored entity and agency securities collateralized by residential mortgage obligations of which   28   were in a loss position for less than 12 months and   11   have been in a loss position for more than 12 months.  The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations were caused by interest rate changes.  The contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency or sponsored entity of the U.S. Government.  Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment.  Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability to hold and does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total of   16   PLRMBS with a remaining principal balance of   $1,895,000   and a net unrealized gain of approximately   $1,064,000  .    11   of these PLRMBS with a remaining principal balance of   $1,711,000   had credit ratings below investment grade.    None   of these securities was recorded with an unrealized loss at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company continues to monitor these securities for indications that declines in value, if any, may be other-than-temporary.  No credit related OTTI charges related to PLRMBS were recorded during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   mutual fund equity investment which had an unrealized gain at   September 30, 2016  .

  Loans 
    
  Total gross loans   increase  d   $31,716,000   or   5.30%   to   $629,827,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $598,111,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The table below includes loans acquired at fair value on July 1, 2013 with outstanding balances of   $50,568,000   and   $62,395,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , in management s judgment, a concentration of loans existed in commercial loans and loans collateralized by real estate, representing approximately   96.2%   of total loans, of which   18.2%   were commercial and   78.0%   were real-estate-related.  This level of concentration is consistent with   97.9%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Although management believes the loans within this concentration have no more than the normal risk of collectibility, a substantial decline in the performance of the economy in general or a decline in real estate values in our primary market areas, in particular, could have an adverse impact on collectibility, increase the level of real estate-related non-performing loans, or have other adverse effects which alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company was not involved in any sub-prime mortgage lending activities during the   nine   or twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , loans acquired in the VCB acquisition had a balance of   $50,568,000  , of which   $1,010,000   were commercial loans,   $41,445,000   were real estate loans, and   $8,113,000   were consumer loans.  At   December 31, 2015  , loans acquired in the VCB acquisition had a balance of   $62,395,000  , of which   $1,617,000   were commercial loans,   $51,576,000   were real estate loans, and   $9,202,000   were consumer loans. 
  We believe that our commercial real estate loan underwriting policies and practices result in prudent extensions of credit, but recognize that our lending activities result in relatively high reported commercial real estate lending levels.  Commercial real estate loans include certain loans which represent low to moderate risk and certain loans with higher risks. 
  The Board of Directors review and approve concentration limits and exceptions to limitations of concentration are reported to the Board of Directors at least quarterly. 
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (OREO), and repossessed assets.  Nonperforming loans are those loans which have (i) been placed on nonaccrual status; (ii) been classified as doubtful under our asset classification system; or (iii) become contractually past due 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest and have not been restructured or otherwise placed on nonaccrual status.  A loan is classified as nonaccrual when 1) it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower; 2) payment in full of principal or interest under the original contractual terms is not expected; or 3) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , total nonperforming assets totaled   $1,637,000  , or   0.13%   of total assets, compared to   $2,413,000  , or   0.19%   of total assets at   December 31, 2015  .  Total nonperforming assets at   September 30, 2016  , included nonaccrual loans totaling   $1,274,000  ,   no   OREO, and   $363,000   repossessed assets.  Nonperforming assets at   December 31, 2015   consisted of   $2,413,000   in nonaccrual loans,   no   OREO, and   no   repossessed assets.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   one

     Table of Contents  

loan considered to be troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) totaling   $20,000   which is included in nonaccrual loans compared to   four   TDRs totaling   $1,337,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not committed to lend additional amounts to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. 
  A summary of nonperforming loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is set forth below.  The Company had no loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing interest at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  Management can give no assurance that nonaccrual and other nonperforming loans will not increase in the future. 
    
  Composition of Nonperforming Loans 

We measure our impaired loans by using the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original contractual interest rate if the loan is not collateral dependent.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had impaired loans totaling   $4,406,000   and   $6,699,000  , respectively.  For collateral dependent loans secured by real estate, we obtain external appraisals which are updated at least annually to determine the fair value of the collateral, and we record an immediate charge off for the difference between the book value of the loan and the appraised less selling costs value of the collateral.  We perform quarterly internal reviews on substandard loans.  We place loans on nonaccrual status and classify them as impaired when it becomes probable that we will not receive interest and principal under the original contractual terms, or when loans are delinquent 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.  Management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower (less than 30 days delinquent) on nonaccrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in future periods.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the change in nonaccrual loans for the first   nine months   of   2016  . 

The following table provides a summary of the change in the OREO balance for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

OREO represents real property taken either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower.  OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell and thereafter carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less selling costs.  We had no OREO properties at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company recorded   $363,000   in repossessed assets at   September 30, 2016   versus none at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  We have established a methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses made up of general and specific allocations.  The methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for an overall allowance for credit losses as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual loans.  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio.  The allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for probable incurred losses related to loans that are not impaired. 
  For all portfolio segments, the determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, including but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment (and in certain cases peer loss data) over the most recent   20   quarters, and qualitative factors including economic trends in the Company s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses incurred in the portfolio taken as a whole.  Management has determined that the most recent   20   quarters was an appropriate look back period based on several factors including various national and local economic indicators, and a time period sufficient to capture enough data due to the size of the portfolio to produce statistically accurate historical loss calculations.  We believe this period is an appropriate look back period.  
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

In originating loans, we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral securing the loan.  The allowance is increased by provisions charged against earnings and reduced by net loan charge offs.  Loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible, or partially charged off when portions of a loan are deemed to be uncollectible.  Recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received. 
  The allowance for credit losses is maintained to cover probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio.  The responsibility for the review of our assets and the determination of the adequacy lies with management and our Audit Committee.  They delegate the authority to the Senior Risk Manager and the Chief Credit Officer (CCO) to determine the loss reserve ratio for each type of asset and to review, at least quarterly, the adequacy of the allowance based on an evaluation of the portfolio, past experience, prevailing market conditions, amount of government guarantees, concentration in loan types and other relevant factors. 
  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the probable incurred credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio.  The allowance is based on: (1) losses accrued for on loans when they are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated and (2) losses accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. 
  Management adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate valuation allowances to cover probable incurred losses.  The Bank s asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets, largely loans and real estate, into various risk categories.  The Bank uses the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk and determining the adequacy of valuation allowances by using a nine-grade system to classify assets.  In general, all credit facilities exceeding 90 days of delinquency require classification and are placed on nonaccrual. 
  The following table sets forth information regarding our allowance for credit losses at the dates and for the periods indicated: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance in the allowance for credit losses was   $9,299,000   compared to   $9,610,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The   decrease   was due to recording a reverse provision for credit losses, partially offset by net recoveries during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  The balance of undisbursed commitments to extend credit on construction and other loans and letters of credit was   $223,393,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $217,166,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of a contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations was   $125,000   and   $150,000  , respectively.      The contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations is calculated by management using appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied processes.  While related to credit losses, this allocation is not a part of the allowance for credit losses and is considered separately as a liability for accounting and regulatory reporting purposes.  Risks and uncertainties exist in all lending transactions and our management and Directors  Loan Committee have established reserve levels based on economic uncertainties and other risks that exist as of each reporting period. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for credit losses was   1.48%   of total gross loans compared to   1.61%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Total loans included VCB loans that were recorded at fair value in connection with the acquisition, which stood at   $50,568,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   $62,395,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  Excluding these VCB loans from the calculation, the allowance for credit losses to total gross loans was   1.61%   and   1.79%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively and general reserves associated with non-impaired loans to total non-impaired loans was   1.59%   and   1.79%  , respectively.      The loan portfolio acquired in the VCB merger was booked at fair value and no associated allocation in the allowance for credit losses.  The size of the fair value discount on the VCB loans remains adequate for all non-impaired acquired loans; therefore, there is no associated allowance for credit losses for the remaining loans acquired from VCB.   
  The Company s loan portfolio balances in   2016   increased through organic growth.  Management believes that the change in the allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio is directionally consistent with the composition of loans and the  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

level of nonperforming and classified loans, partially offset by the general economic conditions experienced in the central California communities serviced by the Company and recent improvements in real estate collateral values.   
  The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, including but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment over the most recent   20   quarters, and qualitative factors.  Assumptions regarding the collateral value of various under-performing loans may affect the level and allocation of the allowance for credit losses in future periods.  The allowance may also be affected by trends in the amount of charge offs experienced or expected trends within different loan portfolios.  However, the total reserve rates on non-impaired loans include qualitative factors which are systematically derived and consistently applied to reflect conservatively estimated losses from loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements.  Based on the above considerations and given recent changes in historical charge-off rates included in the allowance for credit losses modeling and the changes in other factors, management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  Non-performing loans totaled   $1,274,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $2,413,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was   729.91%   and   398.26%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  In addition, management believes that the likelihood of recoveries on previously charged-off loans continues to improve based on the collection efforts of management combined with improvements in the value of real estate which serves as the primary source of collateral for loans.  Management believes the allowance at   September 30, 2016   is adequate based upon its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss trends and other factors.  However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.  The following table illustrates and sets forth additional analysis which portrays the trends that are occurring in the loan portfolio.   

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Business combinations involving the Company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise give rise to goodwill.  Total goodwill at   September 30, 2016  , was   $29,917,000   consisting of   $14,643,000  ,   $8,934,000   and   $6,340,000   representing the excess of the cost of Service 1  st,   Bank of Madera County, and Visalia Community Bank, respectively, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisitions and is not deductible for tax purposes.  A significant decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment.  For that reason, goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment. 
  Management performed an annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2016 utilizing various qualitative factors.  Management believes these factors are sufficient and comprehensive and as such, no further factors need to be assessed at this time.  Based on management s analysis performed, no impairment was required.  Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount.  No such events or circumstances arose during the first   nine months   of   2016  . 
  The intangible assets represent the estimated fair value of the core deposit relationships acquired in the acquisition of Service 1st in 2008 of $1,400,000, and the 2013 acquisition of Visalia Community Bank of $1,365,000.  Core deposit intangibles are being amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over estimated lives of   seven   to   ten   years from the date of acquisition.  The carrying value of intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   was   $922,000  , net of   $1,843,000   in accumulated amortization expense.  The carrying value at   December 31, 2015   was   $1,024,000  , net of   $1,741,000   accumulated amortization expense.  We evaluate the remaining useful lives quarterly to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  Based on the evaluation, no changes to the remaining useful lives was required in the first   nine months   of   2016  .  Amortization expense recognized was   $102,000   and   $253,000   for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Service 1st Bancorp core deposit became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Deposits and Borrowings 
    
  The Bank s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to applicable legal limits.  All of a depositor s accounts at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest bearing transactions accounts, are insured by the FDIC up to standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 for each deposit insurance ownership category. 
  Total deposits   increase  d   $11,230,000   or   1.01%   to   $1,127,497,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,116,267,000   as of   December 31, 2015  , due to recurring seasonal patterns.  Interest-bearing deposits   increase  d   $16,820,000   or   2.45%   to   $704,314,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $687,494,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Non-interest bearing deposits   decrease  d   $5,590,000   or   1.30%   to   $423,183,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $428,773,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Average non-interest bearing deposits to average total deposits was   36.86%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   36.23%   for the same period in   2015  .   
  The composition of the deposits and average interest rates paid at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is summarized in the table below. 

Other Borrowings 
    
  There were   no   short term or long term FHLB borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  We maintain a line of credit with the FHLB collateralized by government securities and loans.  Refer to the   Liquidity   section below for further discussion of FHLB advances.   
  The Company holds junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (trust preferred securities).  Under applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust preferred securities that is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to 25% of the Company s Tier 1 capital on a pro forma basis.  At   September 30, 2016  , all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital.  Interest on the trust preferred securities is payable and the rate is adjusted to equal the three month LIBOR plus 1.60% each January 7, April 7, July 7 or October 7 of each year.  The rates were   2.28%   and   1.88%   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Interest expense recognized by the Company for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $88,000   and   $73,000   respectively.   

Capital 
    
  Capital serves as a source of funds and helps protect depositors and shareholders against potential losses.  Historically, the primary source of capital for the Company has been internally generated capital through retained earnings.

The Company has historically maintained substantial levels of capital.  The assessment of capital adequacy is dependent on several factors including asset quality, earnings trends, liquidity and economic conditions.  Maintenance of adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the Company.  The Company needs to maintain substantial levels of regulatory capital to give it maximum flexibility in the changing regulatory environment and to respond to changes in the market and economic conditions. 
  Our shareholders  equity was   $156,322,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $139,323,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   in shareholders  equity is the result of   increase   in retained earnings from net income of   $12,575,000  , an   increase   in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of   $5,988,000  , exercise of stock options, including the related tax benefit of   $226,000  , and the effect of share based compensation expense of   $196,000  , offset by common stock cash dividends of   $1,986,000  .   
  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Company declared and paid   $1,986,000   in cash dividends ($0.18 per common share) to holders of common stock approved by the Company s Board of Directors.  The Company declared and paid a total of $1,979,000 in cash dividends ($0.18 per common share) to holders of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015.  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , the Bank declared and paid cash dividends to the Company of $13,010,000 in connection with the cash dividends and preparation of the merger approved by the Company s Board of Directors.  The Company would not declare any dividend that, subsequent to payment, would cause it to be deemed not  well capitalized  under applicable banking laws and regulations. 
  Management considers capital requirements as part of its strategic planning process.  The strategic plan calls for continuing increases in assets and liabilities, and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings.  The ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the capital markets as well as our performance.  Management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet its strategic objectives.  The assessment of capital adequacy is dependent on several factors including asset quality, earnings trends, liquidity and economic conditions.  Maintenance of adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the Company.  The Company needs to maintain substantial levels of regulatory capital to give it maximum flexibility in the changing regulatory environment and to respond to changes in the market and economic conditions including acquisition opportunities. 
  The Board of Governors, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items.  Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans. 
  A banking organization s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items.  The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital.  Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets.  Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity.  The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies.   
    In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision ( Basel Committee ) released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified as  Basel III,  which, when fully  phased-in,  would require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than currently required, with a greater emphasis on common equity.  The Basel III capital framework, among other things:  
             
    introduces as a new capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ), more commonly known in the United States as  Tier 1 Common,  and defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations;  
                
    when fully phased in, requires banks to maintain: (i) a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%  capital conservation buffer  (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) an additional  SIFI buffer  for those large institutions deemed to be systemically important, ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, and up to 3.5% under certain conditions; (iii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iv) a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (v) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum

leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter); and 
             
    an additional  countercyclical capital buffer,  generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented. 
       
  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies approved the U.S. version of Basel III.  The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted version of Basel III revises the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with Basel III and to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, some of them apply on a phased in basis to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank.  Among other things, the rules establish a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio (4.00% eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks).  The new additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in from 2016 to 2019 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.  For   September 30, 2016  , the capital conservation buffer required is   0.625%  .  The additional  countercyclical capital buffer  is also required for larger and more complex institutions.  The new rules assign higher risk weighting to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.  The rules also change the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities (through a one-time opt out option for Standardized Banks (banks with less than $250 billion of total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion of foreign exposures) which the Company and the Bank elected at March 31, 2015.  The rules, including alternative requirements for smaller community financial institutions like the Company and the Bank, would be phased in through 2019.  The implementation of the Basel III framework commenced on January 1, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company and the Bank met or exceeded all of their capital requirements inclusive of the capital buffer. 
  A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels.  As discussed above, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital.

Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations, which include funding of securities purchases, providing for customers  credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings.  Our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by our management and Director s Asset/Liability Committees.  This process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs, including adequate cash flow for off-balance sheet commitments. 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and, to a lesser extent, broker deposits, Federal funds facilities with correspondent banks, and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.  These funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans, the routine maturities and pay downs of securities from the securities portfolio, the stability of our core deposits and the ability to sell investment securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unpledged securities totaling   $440,352,000   available as a secondary source of liquidity and total cash and cash equivalents of   $45,078,000  .  Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016     decrease  d   52.36%   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  Primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits, originations and purchases of loans, purchases of investment securities, and payment of operating expenses.  Due to the negative impact of the slow economic recovery, we have been cautiously managing our asset quality.  Consequently, expanding our portfolio or finding appropriate adequate investments to utilize some of our excess liquidity has been difficult in the current economic environment. 
  As a means of augmenting our liquidity, we have established federal funds lines with our correspondent banks.  At   September 30, 2016  , our available borrowing capacity includes approximately   $40,000,000   in unsecured credit lines with our correspondent banks,   $322,592,000   in unused FHLB advances and a   $9,724,000   secured credit line at the Federal Reserve Bank.  We believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate.  At   September 30, 2016  , we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the information generated for use in this Quarterly Report.  The evaluation was based in part upon reports provided by a number of executives.  Based upon, and as of the date of the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  There was no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.
