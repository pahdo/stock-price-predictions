   NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

   For
the period ENDED August 31, 2016    

   (UNAUDITED)

Note 1- Organization
and Description of Business   

Asia Training Institute US, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( the Company ) was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 10, 2015 with the name
Asia Training Institute, Inc. 

Following a unanimous vote by the board of directors
on April 5, 2016, on April 6, 2016 the Company changed its name to Asia Training Institute US, Inc. and filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment. 

The Company has elected November 30th as its year end. 

The Company intends to offer informative business seminars
on varying topics to attendees through the United States. 

Note 2 - Significant
Accounting Policies   

BASIS OF PRESENTATION.   

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial
information. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s most recent Annual
Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for
a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein.
The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year, as reported in its Form S-1, have been omitted. 

The results of operations for the nine month period ended
August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year ending November 30, 2016.    

Note
3 - Going ConcerN   

 The accompanying financial
statements are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no current revenue sources. The
Company s management plans to engage in very limited activities without incurring any liabilities that must be
satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as
a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue- producing contracts or financing or if the
revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail
or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or
other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. 

 These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

   Note
4 - Related Party Transactions    

Equity  

On January 13, 2016 the Company issued an additional 7,000,000

of the Company s business plan. Chia-Yi Lin is a Director of the Company.

During the three month period ending August 31,
2016, our Chief Financial Officer, Chien-Heng Chiang, paid a combined $16,000 of expenses on behalf of the Company.
Chien-Heng Chiang does not request repayment from the Company. This is recorded as additional paid in capital. 

Due to Related Party  

In the nine month period ending August 31, 2016
Chien-Heng Chiang transferred funds to and paid expenses on behalf of the Company totaling $22,141. These transfers and payments
are recorded as due to related party.

31, 2016 and $3,065 at November 30, 2015 and consisted primarily of professional fees.

ITEM 2   
            MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
Quarterly Report of Asia Training Institute US, Inc. on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, particularly those identified with
the words,  anticipates,   believes,   expects,   plans,   intends, 
 objectives,  and similar expressions. These statements reflect management's best judgment based on factors known
at the time of such statements. The reader may find discussions containing such forward-looking statements in the material set
forth under  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  generally, and
specifically therein under the captions  Liquidity and Capital Resources  as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed herein. The forward-looking statements specified
in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered
by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guarantee,
or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.  

The
assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of
future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances.
As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions
from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the
outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability
of those forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements
specified in the following information are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be
important at the time the financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements.  

While
we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.   

PLAN OF OPERATION  

On January 1, 2016 the Company entered into a licensing agreement
with Magic NLP Co., a Taiwanese Company. Per the licensing agreement we are now licensed to provide our future attendees of our
seminars, the same course curriculum as already developed and offered by Magic NLP Co. 

*Magic
NLP Co. is considered a related party as it is controlled by our Chief Executive Officer Chun-Han Lin.  

Currently,
we have plans to    offer informative seminars specifically geared towards primarily successful working adults. The
seminars offered will cover a wide range of topics, including, but not strictly limited to, sales psychology,
professional practitioner certification, tarot cards and hypnotherapy. Going forward we plan to continue to develop new
seminars, begin marketing efforts to reach our core demographic, and expand the reach of our seminars throughout the country
(United States) and potentially the world.  

At this
time we have minimal and nominal operations. We still have significant steps to  take to fully carry out our intended
business plan. To date we have not yet held any seminars.

              CONTROLS
        AND PROCEDURES       
 
   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

  We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures.  

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were ineffective.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

  There
have been no significant changes to the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last
fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2016 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.
