  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (unaudited)   

Note    1     Organization   and   Business   

Alternative Ethanol Technologies, Inc. ( the  Company ), was incorporated in Delaware on December 20, 1996. Effective August 2, 2007, the Company changed its name to CleanTech Biofuels, Inc. Except where otherwise noted, the words  we,   us,   our,  and similar terms, as well as  CleanTech  or the  Company,  refer to CleanTech Biofuels, Inc. and its  subsidiaries, collectively.  

On March 27, 2007,  the Company acquired SRS Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( SRS Energy ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization. In accordance with the merger agreement, SRS Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into SRS Energy. The merger was consummated on May 31, 2007 and resulted in SRS Energy becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the merger, the stockholders of SRS Energy surrendered all of their issued and outstanding common stock and received shares of the Company s common stock, $.001 par value per share ( Common Stock ). The former parent of SRS Energy, Supercritical Recovery Systems, Inc., immediately prior to the merger, distributed 78.8% of its 96% ownership in SRS Energy to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. For accounting purposes, because the Company had been a public shell company prior to the merger, the merger was treated as an acquisition of the Company and a recapitalization of SRS Energy.   

The Company is  in its development stage and has been engaged in technology development and pre-operational activities since its formation.   The Company is currently seeking outside sources of funding that will provide the capital for us to design, build, and operate a commercial biomass recovery plant that will allow us to produce biomass feedstock for customer evaluation, trial purchases, and/or be used in equipment selection for power generation and possibly combined heat and power (CHP) production. Initially, the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel research firms for evaluation. In addition to seeking a source of funding for plant development, the Company hopes to license and/or develop potential commercial projects as they present themselves. All of our developments plan to focus on cleaning and separating MSW into its component parts in order to obtain: (i) a homogenous feedstock of cellulosic biomass for producing energy and other chemical products and (ii) recyclable products (metals, plastics, aluminum). Our plans may also include the possibility of operating a MSW transfer station where we could install our technology.   

The  Company has no operating history as a producer of biomass or energy sources and has not constructed any plants to date. We have no revenues and will be required to secure outside funding in order to execute our business plan and commercialize our products. Our current cash is not sufficient to fund our current operations. Our liabilities are substantially greater than our current available funds and current assets. Although we continue to seek additional financing through the sale of additional equity, various government funding opportunities and/or possibly through strategic alliances with larger energy or waste management companies, we have not had recent success securing meaningful amounts of financing. The Company will require substantial additional financing to implement its business plan and it may be unable to obtain the capital required to do so. If we are not able to immediately and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve profitability or positive cash flow, we may not be able to continue operations.  

The accompanying unaudited,  consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Articles 8 and 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 28, 2016.

Note    2       Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In  March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation.  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     

In  February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases.  This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases and will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU requires adoption based upon a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In August 2014, the FASB  issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s ability to continue as a Going Concern.  This ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements and requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. This new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In May 2014, the FASB  issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also specifies new accounting for costs associated with obtaining or fulfilling contracts with customers and expands the required disclosures related to revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption, with early application not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of this ASU. This standard will now become effective beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  

There were various other accounting standards updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific industries, and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Note 3        Mergers  /  Acquisition  s   

25 Van Keuren LLC   

 On June 23, 2016, Clean Tech Biofuels, Inc. entered into an Acquisition Agreement with 25 Van Keuren LLC, a New Jersey Limited Liability Company ( Van Keuren ), pursuant to which the Company acquired 99% of the outstanding membership interests in Van Keuren with the former members of Van Keuren retaining a 1% interest.   

The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has received certification of an amendment to the Solid Waste Management Plan from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  ( DEP ) to include the proposed operation of a municipal solid waste transfer station and material recovery facility ( TS/MRF ) at a site located in Jersey City, New Jersey. CleanTech Biofuels and Van Keuren intend to seek the necessary permits and approvals from the New Jersey DEP to build, own and operate the TS/MRF. As part of the acquisition, CleanTech acquired an option to lease the property in Jersey City within 30 days after the final permit issues from the New Jersey DEP. The Company intends to: (1) install its Biomass Recovery Process on the site, and (2) operate the TS/MRF.  

8

Van Keuren has had no operations or revenue since inception and has solely been working towards obtaining the permits required to operate the TS/MRF. As payment for the acquisition, the Company issued in the aggregate 1,000,000 shares of  restricted common stock of the Company (par value $0.001) to certain holders of membership interests in Van Keuren. As of the close of business on June 23, 2016, the Company stock quote was $0.05. The total assets of Van Keuren at the time of the acquisition were $51,000 (2.3% of the Company s assets). The liabilities and equity consisted of accounts payable of $27,000 and member equity of $24,000. The assets consist solely of costs incurred towards obtaining the required permits and have been recorded as an intangible asset on our consolidated financial statements. This intangible will be expensed if and when the Company and Van Keuren complete the permit process and begin operations.  

Biomass North America Licensing, Inc.    

 On September 15, 2008, the Company consummated the acquisition of Biomass North America Licensing, Inc. ( Biomass ) pursuant to a merger between Biomass and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (with Biomass as the surviving subsidiary of the Company) in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between the Company and Biomass. By virtue of the merger, the Company acquired a license agreement pursuant to which the Company holds a license in the United States and Canada to use patent ed technology licensed from Biomass North America, LLC, the former parent of Biomass (the  Licensor ), to clean and separate MSW (the  Biomass Recovery Process ). In July 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US patent number 7,745,208 for this process (the  BRP Patent ).  

U pon consummation of the merger, the Company paid $20,000 in cash and issued a promissory note in the original principal amount of $80,000 bearing interest at an annual rate of 6% to a shareholder of the Licensor. This note has been paid in full. Additionally, the Company issued to the four shareholders of the Licensor a total of 1,895,000 shares of Common Stock and deposited an additional 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock into an escrow account (collectively, the  Shares ). The Shares were issued as part of the merger consideration received by the shareholders of the Licensor. In accordance with a November 2013 amendment, the Company has an exclusive license in the United States and Canada to use the Biomass Recovery Process and includes no performance requirements on the Company; the license agreement is for a term of 21 years from the date of the amendment or the life of any patent issued for the Biomass Recovery Process, including any amendments, modifications or extensions; the license requires that the Company pay a royalty in the amount of $2.00 per ton of MSW used in the Biomass Recovery Process to the Licensor; and the Company released the 4,000,000 shares of common stock to the Licensor previously held in escrow since the merger. The Company has recorded a long-term asset of approximately $1.6 million which it will begin to amortize upon utilizing the license in our operations.   

Note 4      Goodwill and Intangible Asset   

Goodwill   

 The changes in Goodwill were as follows: 

The Goodwill recorded was a result of the acquisition of Van Keuren in June 2016 as disclosed previously in Note 3. The amount of Goodwill represents the fair value paid for the acquisition (shares of Company common stock) in excess of the value of the net assets of Van Keuren. 

9

Intangible Asset   

 The  component of the Intangible Asset is as follows:  

The Company  s goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. The Company performs an impairment analysis on its goodwill and intangible assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment only when impairment indicators are present.  

Note    5     Patent   

T he Company owns US Patent No. 6,306,248 (the  PSC Patent ), which is the underlying technology upon which the BRP Patent is based. The Company acquired the PSC Patent on October 22, 2008 pursuant to a Patent Purchase Agreement ( Agreement ) with World Waste Technologies, Inc. ( WWT ). As part of the acquisition of the PSC Patent, we also became the licensor of such technology under the existing license agreement between Bio-Products International, Inc., the licensee ( Bio-Products ) and WWT. The Company has paid WWT $600,000 and issued warrants to purchase 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.10 per share and 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.11 per share. WWT assigned all of its rights, title and interest in the note, warrants, security agreement and purchase agreement to Vertex Energy, Inc. ( Vertex ) as a result of a merger in March 2009. The warrants had an exercisable term of five years which expired on October 22, 2014. The cost of the PSC Patent acquisition of $600,000 is recorded as a long-term asset on the Balance Sheet.   

O n September 1, 2010, the Company issued a promissory note to CMS Acquisition, LLC ( CMS ) in the amount of $100,000 and bearing interest at 6.0% per annum. The note is secured with a security interest in the PSC Patent. In connection with the financing, the Company issued a warrant to CMS to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.05 per share. The warrant is exercisable at any time for five years from the date of issuance or re-issuance. The note was originally to mature on February 28, 2011. The Company and CMS have entered into various amendments extending the due date, the most recent of which was March 17, 2015, which extended the due date to September 17, 2016 (we are working with the noteholder to extend the due date). As consideration in these amendments, the Company has: (i) paid $25,000 in February 2011 towards accrued interest to date and principal on the Note (ii) increased the interest rate to 10% as of May 15, 2011, (iii) re-dated the original warrants to March 17, 2015, (iv) issued new warrants for 300,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.05 and exercisable at any time until March 17, 2020, (v) issued new warrants for 150,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.10 and exercisable at any time until March 17, 2020, and (vi) the Company has approved the assignment of the note by CMS to the WL Meyer Legacy Trust as of the March 17, 2015 amendment.   

Note    6   - Technology Licenses   

Biomass North America Licensing, Inc.    

 We own  an exclusive license in the United States and Canada to use the Biomass Recovery Process (See Note 3   Mergers/Acquisitions). We have recorded a long-term asset of approximately $1.6 million for the value of this license. Amortization of this asset will begin upon commencement of the use of the Biomass Recovery Process.   

In accordance with a November 2013 amendment, the Company has an exclusive license in the United States and Canada to use the Biomass Recovery Process and includes no performance requirements on the Company; the license agreement is for a term of 21 years from the date of the amendment or the life of any patent issued for the Biomass Recovery Process, including any amendments, modifications or extensions;  and the license requires that the Company pay a royalty in the amount of $2.00 per ton of MSW used in the Biomass Recovery Process to the Licensor.  

10

Bio-Products International, Inc.   

 As disclosed in  Note 5 - Patent, the Company acquired the PSC Patent in 2008 and as a result, became the licensor to Bio-Products for the PSC Patent pursuant to a Master License Agreement dated as of August 18, 2003 (the  PSC License Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the PSC License Agreement, Bio-Products (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Earth Solutions, Inc.,  CES ) is the exclusive licensee of the PSC Patent and has the right to sublicense the technology that is part of the PSC Patent (but not the BRP Patent) to any party. In addition, we are entitled to be paid 5% of any revenue derived by Bio-Products from the use of the technology and 40% of any sublicensing fees paid to Bio-Products for the use of the technology. The Master License Agreement is for a term of 20 years that commenced on August 18, 2003. On September 22, 2010, the Company sent a Notice of Breach to Bio-Products, which included removing the exclusivity of the license. We received a response from Bio-Products on November 5, 2010 disputing our claims. In February 2011, we became aware that Bio-Products effected a transfer of the license in violation of the PSC License Agreement. As a result, on March 21, 2011, we sent a notice of termination to Bio-Products and the transferee terminating the License Agreement. In June 2011, Steve Vande Vegte, a shareholder in CES, filed a lawsuit against various parties, including the Company. The only Cause of Action against the Company is for Declaratory Relief seeking to avoid our March 2011 termination of the license to which Mr. Vande Vegte is not a party. On August 5, 2011, the Company filed a demurrer requesting that the court dismiss the case on the grounds that Mr. Vande Vegte lacks standing to pursue a claim concerning the license and that the claim raised in the complaint is not ripe. The court granted our demurrer to dismiss CleanTech from this lawsuit on December 8, 2011.   

All i ntangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value.  

Note    7           Debt   

11

Convertible Notes      Payable    - Since September 2008, the Company has conducted six offerings of units comprised of a convertible promissory note and a warrant, and one offering of a convertible note (with no warrant), having the terms set forth below:  

Each note holder retains the option of a cash repayment of the note plus interest, or the note can be converted at any time during the term of the note or prior to the closing of any Qualifying Equity Financing (minimum capital received of $5 million), into shares of Common Stock at the conversion price noted above.  All notes have been recorded as debt (notes payable) in the financial statements, net of discounts for the conversion and warrant features (except for the 11/10, 5/12, 2/14, and 2015 Offerings which carried no discounts). See Subsequent Events footnote for further disclosure regarding our notes.   

2008 Offering   - During September 2008, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $642,000 of investment proceeds through March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2010, all of these notes had either been converted to shares of our common stock or exchanged into our 2009 Offering (resulting in new notes with a total face value of $539,829, which included the original principal and interest through the date of exchange).   

2009    Offering    - During April 2009, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $1,198,500 of investment proceeds through August 2010. Three notes have been converted to shares of Common Stock (one each in 2009, 2010, and 2014). Beginning in March 2011, certain notes were exchanged into our 11/10 Offering or our 7.1.15 Note Payable. As a result, as of September 30, 2016, we had $199,790 face value of notes outstanding, which includes the exchanged notes from our 2008 Offering. All of these notes have matured. We plan to work with each remaining note holder to exchange, convert or repay these notes.  

6/10    Offering    - During June 2010, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $75,000 of investment proceeds in one note. Upon maturity in June 2011, this note was exchanged into our 11/10 Offering. As a result, the balance due on this offering is $-0-.   

11/10    Offering    - During November 2010, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $451,713 of investment proceeds. Three notes were converted to shares of Common Stock during 2011 and four notes were converted to shares of Common Stock in 2012. As of September 30 2016, we had $1,877,162 face value of notes outstanding, which includes exchanged notes from our 2009 Offering. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $1.82 million of these notes matured. We plan to work with each remaining note holder to exchange, convert or repay these notes.

2/14    Offering    - During February 2014, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $100,000 of investment proceeds in one note. As of September 30, 2016, this note is outstanding and has matured. We plan to work with the note holder to exchange, convert or repay this note.   

2015    Offering    - During September 2015, the Company commenced an offering of units and, as of September 30, 2016, had raised a total of $85,000 of investment proceeds.   

12

WL Meyer Legacy Trust (formerly CMS Acquisition, LLC)      N  ote Payable    - In September 2010, the Company issued a note in the amount of $100,000 (interest at 6.0% per annum through May 15, 2011 and 10.0% thereafter and secured by a security interest in the PSC Patent) and issued warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.05 per share. The note is due the earlier of: (i) September 17, 2016 pursuant to an amendment on March 17, 2015 or (ii) the date on which $500,000 or more in the aggregate is raised by the Company in future offerings (we are working with the noteholder to extend the due date). The warrants are exercisable at any time for five years from the date of issuance or reissuance. The value of these warrants has been recorded as a contra-balance amount discount with the note and was fully amortized (interest expense) as of February 28, 2011 (the original due date). As consideration in these amendments, the Company has: (i) paid $25,000 in February 2011 towards accrued interest to date and principal on the note, (ii) increased the interest rate to 10% as of May 15, 2011, (iii) re-dated the original warrants to March 17, 2015, (iv) issued new warrants for 300,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.05 and exercisable at any time until March 17, 2020, (v) issued new warrants for 150,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $0.10 and exercisable at any time until March 17, 2020, and (vi) the Company has approved the assignment of the note by CMS Acquisition LLC to the WL Meyer Legacy Trust per the March 17, 2015 amendment. As of September 30, 2016, $77,696 face value of this note is outstanding.  

7.1.15 Convertible      N  ote Payable    - On July 1, 2015, one noteholder in our 2009 Offering exchanged two notes into this note. This new note carries a 6% annual rate of interest, compounded annually, and is due in quarterly installment payments: the greater of $3,000 or 10% of all investment proceeds received during the calendar quarter preceding the quarterly installment payment. As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance of this note was $1,929.  

June 2016      N  ote Payable      The Company received an investment of $50,000 in June 2016 in exchange for this note, which carries a 9% annual rate of interest, and is due on December 3, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the principal balance of this note was $50,000.  

The discounts on all notes payable have been amortized on a straight-line basis over the  original term of each note. All discounts were fully amortized and expensed as of June 30, 2011. The following is a summary of warrants issued and outstanding as of the dates below, at the exercise price and the amount of shares of Common Stock (these warrants have not been exercised or converted to shares of Common Stock).  

(a) Warrants issued to investors under these Subscription Agreements can be exercised anytime within three years from date of Agreement. These warrants currently expire at various dates from October 2016 through July 2019. 

Note    8   - Stockholders    Equity (  Deficit  )   

In August 2013, the Company commenced an offering of units, under a Subscription Agreement, at a purchase price of $1,000 per unit (Equity Offering 8/13). Each unit consists of: (i) 10,000 shares of the Company  s authorized but unissued restricted Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase 30,000 additional shares of Common Stock for a three-year period from the date of issuance of the units at an initial exercise price of $0.15 per share. As of September 30,   2016, the Company issued 6,635,000 restricted shares (at $0.10 per share) of our Common Stock in exchange for $663,500 in investment in this offering. See Subsequent Event footnote for further updates to this offering and other share grants affecting Stockholders Equity.  

In  February 2016, the Board approved a grant to certain Board members and management for an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of restricted common stock (at $0.013 per share). The Board granted these awards in recognition of the efforts of the recipients towards the furtherance and implementation of the Company s strategic plan and to induce the recipients to continue those efforts on behalf of the Company. Based on the foregoing, the Board determined such grants were in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.  

13

In June 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of Van Keuren, as previously disclosed in Note 3, and issued in the aggregate 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company ( at $0.05 per share) to certain holders of membership interests in Van Keuren.   

Net Loss per    s  hare    The Company calculates basic loss per share ( EPS ) and diluted EPS. EPS is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS would reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants and other convertible securities. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had options, warrants and other convertible securities to purchase an aggregate of approximately 92 million and 87 million shares of our common stock, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effects would have been anti-dilutive. Therefore, the Company only presents basic loss per share on the statement of operations.  

Note    9   - Related Party Transactions   

T he Company has entered into stock purchase agreements with its executive officers and certain members of the Board of Directors ( Board ). The executive officers and directors issued notes to the Company in exchange for their stock purchases. These notes and accumulated interest are recorded as notes receivable in Stockholders  Deficit.  

In September 2013, the Company hired, on a part-time basis, a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and a VP-Business Development (VP-BD). These individuals maintain their engineering firm Fenton Engineering International (FEI) on a full-time basis and  receive no salary in their part-time positions but are eligible for grants of stock options. We have used and continue to use their services. As of September 30, 2016, all amounts have been paid to FEI except for approximately $48,000.  

Two  members of our current Board, James Russell and David Bransby, are parties in investments made in our convertible note offerings. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of these investments, including interest, is approximately $758,000 and $677,000, respectively.   

Beginning in  2009, the Company provided advances to two employees   Ed Hennessey and Mike Kime. Mr. Kime resigned from his positions with the Company effective June 21, 2010. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate balances of advances totaled approximately $14,000 and $33,000, respectively. The balances are included in Prepaids and Other Current Assets on the Balance Sheet.   

Note    10     Share-based Payments   

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards including  stock options and restricted stock issued to employees, directors and consultants and is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Company has no awards with market or performance conditions.  

In March 2007, the Company  assumed and adopted the 2007 Stock Option Plan ( Stock Plan ) for its employees, directors and consultants, which includes an equity compensation plan for non-employee directors pursuant to which stock options and shares of restricted stock may be granted.  The Company currently has reserved a maximum of 14,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued for stock options or restricted shares awarded under the Stock Plan.   

In  February 2015, the Company granted options under the Stock Plan to purchase an aggregate of 350,000 shares of Common Stock to a consultant in which one-half vested immediately and the remaining options vest in February 2016, with an exercise price of $0.10. As of September 30, 2016, none of these options were cancelled or expired and 350,000 shares of these options were vested.  

In  September 2013, the Company granted options under the Stock Plan to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to two part-time employees (newly hired CTO and VP BD) in which one-third will vest ratably beginning in September 2014, with an exercise price of $0.10. As of September 30, 2016, none of these options were cancelled or expired and 1,000,000 shares of these options were vested.  

14

Stock option expense is recognized in the statements of operations ratably over the vesting period based on the number of options that are expected to ultimately vest. Our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.  The Company incurred no share-based compensation expense related to option grants for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The potential tax benefit realizable for the anticipated tax deductions of the exercise of share-based payment arrangements  totaled approximately $312,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. However, due to the uncertainty that the tax benefits will be realized, these potential benefits were not recognized currently. As of September 30, 2016, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to all current share-based payment arrangements.   

The following table summarizes  the Company s stock option activity and related information under the Stock Plan:   

(1) The weighted-average exercise price at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for all outstanding and exercisable options was greater than the fair value of the Company s common stock on that date, resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of $-0-. 

The following table summarizes information about the Company s issuances of restricted stock  under the Stock Plan:  

The Company issued  the following grants outside of the Stock Plan: (1) restricted Common Stock: (i) in January 2015 for 500,000 shares to a member of management, (ii) in January 2014 for 500,000 shares to a consultant to provide services regarding the collection, recycling, transfer, and disposal of MSW, (iii) in April 2014, to certain Board members and management for 4,250,000 shares in the aggregate, (iv) in February 2016, to certain Board members and a member of management for 4,000,000 shares in the aggregate; and (2) in February 2016, the Board approved the issuance of stock option agreements to a member of management and certain consultants for the purchase of 3,600,000 shares, in the aggregate, of common stock, and (v) in September 2016 for 750,000 shares to a consultant to provide certain corporate services. The shares issued to Board members and management were in recognition of the efforts of the recipients towards the furtherance and implementation of the Company s strategic plan and to induce the recipients to continue those efforts on behalf of the Company. Total expense related to these grants for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $-0- and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $52,800 and $5,200, respectively (included in our general and administrative expense).  

All of the share grant awards vest immediately and were issued pursuant to Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ), or Section 4(a)(2) of the Act, and will therefore be  restricted securities  as such term is used in Rule 144 of the Act. The option agreements carry the following terms: seven year agreements, vesting in thirds ratably over three years, and are exercisable at the Company  s closing stock price as of the date of the grant.

Company Overview  

The following discussion of our  Company Overview, Recent Developments and Plan of Operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance. These risks and other factors include, among others, those listed under  Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.   

The Company is in its development stage and is  focused on being a provider of: (i) cellulosic biomass derived from municipal solid waste, also known as MSW, as a feedstock for producing energy and other chemical products  , (ii) recyclables (metals, plastics, glass) from the MSW, and (iii)   possibly operating a MSW transfer station where we could install our technology. We are the exclusive licensee in the United States and Canada of patented technology, which we refer to as our Biomass Recovery Process, that cleans and separates MSW and generates a clean, homogeneous biomass feedstock that we believe can be converted into various energy products. Our license permits us to use the biomass we derive from MSW to produce all energy products. In addition  , we own the patent for a pressurized steam classification technology originally developed by the University of Alabama in Huntsville that we refer to as our PSC technology. The PSC technology is the underlying technology upon which the Biomass Recovery Process is based. Prior to March 2011, we had licensed the PSC technology to Bio-Products International, Inc. ( Bio-Products ). However, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Bio-Products in March 2009,   we had the right to use the Biomass Recovery Process technology worldwide, for any product that we desired and with no royalty due to Bio-Products. We terminated the license to Bio-Products in March 2011 as further described in the section entitled  Intellectual Property Terms.  The Company has spent $-0- on research and development activities for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  

17

We are a Delaware corporation.  We were originally incorporated in 1996 as Long Road Entertainment, Inc., and were formed to operate as a holding company for businesses in the theater, motion picture and entertainment industries. We ceased conducting that business in 2005 and were dormant until the fall of 2006, at which time our founder and then controlling stockholder decided to pursue the sale of the company. In anticipation of that sale, we changed our name to Alternative Ethanol Technologies, Inc.  

On March 27, 2007, we entered into  an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization in which we agreed to acquire SRS Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that at that time was seeking to commercialize various technologies for the processing of waste materials into usable products. We consummated the merger on May 31, 2007 resulting in SRS Energy becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary.   Effective August 2, 2007, we changed our name to CleanTech Biofuels, Inc.  

We have no operating history as a producer of  biomass feedstocks or any energy products and have not constructed any operating plants to date. We have not earned any revenues to date and our current capital and other existing resources are not sufficient to fund the implementation of our business plan or our required working capital. We will require substantial additional capital to implement our business plan and we may be unable to immediately obtain the capital required to continue operating.   

Recent Developments  

Acquisition of      25 Van Keuren LLC    

 On June 23, 2016, Clean Tech entered into an Acquisition Agreement with 25 Van Keuren LLC, a New Jersey Limited Liability Company ( Van Keuren ) pursuant to which the Company acquired 99% of the outstanding membership interests in Van Keuren and the former members of Van Keuren retained a 1% interest.   

The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has received certification of an amendment to the Solid Waste Management Plan from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  ( DEP ) to include the proposed operation of a municipal solid waste transfer station and material recovery facility ( TS/MRF ) at a site located in Jersey City, New Jersey. CleanTech and Van Keuren intend to seek the necessary permits and approvals from the New Jersey DEP to build, own and operate the TS/MRF. As part of the acquisition, CleanTech acquired an option to lease the property located in Jersey City within 30 days after the final permit issues from the New Jersey DEP. The Company intends to: (1) install its Biomass Recovery Process on the site, and (2) operate the TS/MRF.  

Van Keuren has had no operations or revenue since inception and has solely been working towards obtaining the permits required to operate the TS/MRF. As payment for the acquisition, the Company issued in the aggregate 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company (par value $0.001) to certain holders of membership interests in Van Keuren. As of the close of business on June 23, 2016, the Company stock quote was $0.05 . The total assets of Van Keuren at the time of the acquisition were $51,000 (2.3% of the Company s assets). The liabilities and equity consisted of accounts payable of $27,000 and member equity of $24,000. The assets consist solely of costs incurred towards obtaining the required permits and have been recorded as an intangible asset on our consolidated financial statements. This intangible will be expensed if and when the Company and Van Keuren complete the permit process and begin operations.  

Investments   

 In August 2013, the Company commenced an offering of units, under a Subscription Agreement, at a purchase price of $1,000 per unit  (Equity Offering 8/13). Each unit consists of: (i) 10,000 shares of the Company s authorized but unissued restricted common stock, par value $0.001 ( Common Stock ) and (ii) warrants to purchase 30,000 additional shares of Common Stock for a three-year period from the date of issuance of the units at an initial exercise price of $0.15 per share. As of November 11, 2016  , the Company has issued 6,635,000 restricted shares of our Common Stock in exchange for $663,500 in investment in this offering.  

18

The Company received an investment of $35,000 in October 2016 in exchange for a promissory note, which carries a 9% annual rate of interest, and a term of six months. 

All of the promissory notes in our 2009 , 5/12 and 2/14 Offerings, and certain notes in our 11/10 Offering are now due. As of November 11, 2016, approximately $3.6 million is currently due, including interest. We will work with each remaining note holder to exchange, or convert, these promissory notes. There can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with any or all of these note holders and we may be required to repay such amounts.  

Plan of    Operation   

Our focus  is to secure sufficient capital to fund our current working capital requirements and the construction of a commercial plant as described further in this section. We have had an ongoing lack of liquidity, and currently do not have sufficient capital to continue to fund our proposed operations, and are relying on the minimal assets on hand to fund our limited operations and corporate existence. All of our on-going and proposed developments/projects require a significant amount of capital that we currently do not have. While we continue to pursue outside sources of funding, we have not had success securing meaningful amounts of outside capital in recent years. As a result, we can provide no assurance that we will secure any source of funding in the immediate time frame required and the failure to do so will likely result in an inability to continue operations.  

Our company was initially conceived as a fully-integrated producer of cellulosic ethanol  from MSW.   Based on our investigation and acquisition of new technologies and research and development of our existing technologies in 2008, we re-focused our business to the commercialization of our Biomass Recovery Process technology for cleaning and separating MSW into its component parts and initiated a plan to consolidate the ownership and/or rights to use intellectual property around this technology. The technology is currently in commercial use in Coffs Harbor, Australia by an operator not owned by the Company (the  Third-Party Operator ). As a result, we believe this technology could be implemented commercially in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of our focus, we are continuing our ongoing search for an outside source of financing that will provide the capital for us to design, build, and operate a commercial biomass recovery plant that will allow us to produce biomass feedstock for customer evaluation, trial purchases, and/or be used in equipment selection for power generation and possibly combined heat and power (CHP) production. Initially, the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel research firms for evaluation. In addition to seeking a source of funding for plant development, the Company hopes to license and/or develop potential commercial projects as they present themselves. All of our developments plan to focus on cleaning and separating MSW into its component parts in order to obtain: (i) a homogenous feedstock of cellulosic biomass for producing energy and other chemical products and (ii) recyclable products (metals, plastics). Our plans may also include the possibility of operating a MSW transfer station where we could install our technology.  

Jersey City   

With our acquisition of Van Keuren, as described earlier under Recent Developments, the Company  s primary focus is to seek the necessary permits and approvals from the New Jersey DEP to build, own and operate the TS/MRF in Jersey City, NJ. As part of the acquisition, CleanTech acquired an option to lease the property located in Jersey City and intends to: (1) install its Biomass Recovery Process on the site, and (2) operate the TS/MRF. The Company may initially operate this location as a transfer station (after receiving the required permits and approvals) while designing and installing our Biomass Recovery Process equipment on the site. The biomass feedstock output would then be expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel and chemical research firms for evaluation.  

Biomass Feedstock Production   

We are working to  develop one or more other locations where waste collected would be processed using our technology and the biomass produced used to create heat and/or power.   Initially, the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel and chemical research firms for evaluation. In addition to research and development, the Company also plans to license and/or develop potential commercial projects.  

19

In  addition to the developments we are currently contemplating, from time to time other development opportunities are presented to us and we evaluate those potential developments. If we are able to operate a plant  , and thereafter refine our know-how with respect to implementation of the technology, we intend to seek to partner with waste haulers, landfill owners and municipalities to implement the technology across the United States and internationally.  

Any  development of commercial plants and/or implementation of the licensing of our technology described above will require significant additional capital, which we currently do not have. To date, we have not been successful in raising the amount of capital necessary to implement our business plan and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital. While we anticipate that financing for the commercial biomass recovery plant and these other potential projects could also be provided in part via tax exempt bond financing or through the use of loan guarantees from local, state and federal authorities, we have not secured any such financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any such financing.   

Bio-Fuel and Bio-Chemical Joint Testing/Research   

If we are able to process MSW into biomass through our potential future biomass recovery plant and/or in future commercial vessels, we hope to enter into joint research agreements with companies looking to process biomass in their system(s) for various types of energy and chemical production. We believe that this testing and research could provide possible revenue streams, projects and additional opportunities for use of our biomass. 

In February 2012, we entered into a Confidentiality Agreement and Material Transfer Agreement with Sweetwater Energy, Inc. ( Sweetwater ), a renewable energy company with patent-pending technology to produce sugars from several types of biomass for use in the biofuel, biochemical and bioplastics markets. We agreed and coordinated with the Third-Party Operator in Australia to ship 10 pounds of biomass produced at the Third-Party Operator  s facility to the Sweetwater lab for testing. The shipment arrived in May 2012 and Sweetwater has completed their initial testing. In June 2011, we entered into a Confidential Disclosure and Sampling Agreement with Novozymes North America, Inc., a developer of industrial enzymes, microorganisms, and biopharmaceutical ingredients for conversion into a variety of energy and chemical products. In July 2011, we supplied a sample of our biomass product for testing in their enzymatic hydrolysis process. Some initial testing was completed during the 3 rd  Quarter of 2011. We expect further testing to occur for both of these companies and for possible additional companies upon securing the requisite financing to build a biomass recovery plant to process MSW.  

New Technologies     ; Commercializing Existing Technologies    

Because of our  ability to produce a clean, homogenous biomass feedstock, we may be presented with the opportunity to partner with or acquire new technologies once we become operational. In addition to developing our current technologies, we intend to continue to add technologies to our suite of solutions that complement our core operations. We believe that our current technologies and aspects of technologies in development or contemplation will enable us to eventually expand our business to use organic material from other waste streams such as municipal bio-solids from waste water facilities and animal waste for fuel production.  

To commerc ialize our technology, we anticipate we will need to:  

construct and operate a commercial plant that: (i) processes MSW into cellulosic biomass for conve rsion into energy or chemical products and (ii) separates recyclables (metals, plastics, glass) for single-stream recycling;  

identify and partner with landfill owners, waste haulers and municipalities to identify locations suitable for our technology; and 

pursue additional opportunities to implement our technology in commercial settings at transfer stations and landfills in  our licensed territories.   

20

Our ability to implement this strategy  is heavily dependent on our ability to raise significant amounts of additional capital and to hire appropriate managers and staff. Our success will also depend on a variety of market forces and other developments beyond our control.   

Results of Operations  

The following table set s forth the amounts of expenses and changes in our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The company s activities and related primary expenses are in the following categories: General and administrative   payroll (including share-based compensation, stock grants, and payroll taxes), general office expenses, travel, and business insurance; Professional fees - consulting, accounting and legal fees; Other expense (income)   interest expense on convertible notes payable and interest income on notes receivable related to restricted stock grants  .  

General    and Administrative    The increase in 2016 is primarily due to miscellaneous corporate costs and travel expenses  .  

Interest Expense     The increase is due to the compounding effect of interest on our notes payable and a full three-months interest for the period ended September 30, 2016 for an investment in September 2015 in our 2015 Offering.       

Interest Income, net of accrued interest written-off     A note receivable to purchase shares of our common stock, originally issued in August 2007, matured in August 2016 and was not paid. As a result, the accrued interest income of approximately $15,000 and the note were written-off and the shares were forfeited and cancelled.  

Genera l and Administrative      The increase in 2016 is primarily due to the expense recorded for the restricted common share grants in 2016 to a member of management and certain board members.  

Professional Fees     The increase in 2016 is due to increased legal expenses of $7,000.  

Interest Expense     The increase is due to the compounding effect of interest on our notes payable and a full nine-months interest for the period ended September 30, 2016 for an investment in September 2015 in our 2015 Offering.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As a development- stage company, we have no revenues and will be required to obtain an outside source of capital in order to execute our business plan and commercialize our products. Beginning in September 2008 and as of November 11, 2016, we raised an aggregate of: (i) approximately $3.2 million in separate offerings of units comprised of a convertible note and warrants in separate offerings from 2008 through 2015, (ii) $85,000 in two notes payable in 2016  , and (ii) $663  ,500 in an equity offering of restricted Common Stock through our Subscription Agreements (our Equity Offering 8/13) commencing in 2013. We are continuing to explore opportunities to raise cash through the issuance of these units and other financing opportunities, however to date we have not been successful in doing so. As of November 11, 2016, our current cash and other assets are not sufficient to fund our operations. As of September 30, 2016, we had a significant working capital deficit. Our liabilities are substantially greater than our current assets. Our only significant assets are our intellectual property rights, which are intangible and not readily convertible into liquid assets.   

We are attempting to identify one or more potential sources of  additional financing, such as through the sale of additional equity, various government funding opportunities and/or possibly through strategic alliances with larger energy or waste management companies.   The Company will continue to explore and if identified, evaluate financing alternatives and/or other transactions, including potentially retaining a financial advisor. However, we may not be successful in securing additional financing. If we are not able to obtain additional financing in the immediate future, we will be required to further delay our development until such financing becomes available. Further, even assuming that we secure additional funds, we may never achieve profitability or positive cash flow. If we are not able to timely and successfully raise additional capital and/or achieve profitability or positive cash flow, we will not have sufficient capital resources to implement our business plan or to continue our operations  .  

Debt  

Convertible Notes    Payable   -  Since September 2008, the Company has conducted six offerings of units comprised of a convertible promissory note and a warrant, and one offering of a convertible note (with no warrant), having the terms set forth below:  

Each note holder retains the option of cash repayment of the note plus interest, or can convert the note at any time during the term of the note or prior to the closing of any Qualifying Equity Financing (minimum capital received of $5 million) into shares of Common Stock at the conversion price noted above.  All notes have been recorded as debt (notes payable) in the financial statements, net of discounts for the conversion and warrant features (except for the 11/10, 5/12, 2/14, and 2015 Offerings which carried no discounts). The discounts have been amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of each note and were fully amortized as of December 31, 2011.  

2008    Offering    - During September 2008, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $642,000 of investment proceeds through March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2010, all of these notes had either been converted to shares of our common stock or exchanged into our 2009 Offering (resulting in new notes with a total face value of $539,829, which included the original principal and interest through the date of exchange).

As a result, as of September 30, 2016, we had $199,790 face value of notes outstanding, which includes the exchanged notes from our 2008 Offering. All of these notes have matured. We plan to work with each remaining note holder to exchange, convert or repay these notes.  

6/10    Offering    - During June 2010, the Company commenced an offering of units and raised a total of $75,000 of investment proceeds in one note. Upon maturity in June 2011, this note was exchanged into our 11/10 Offering. As a result, the balance due on this offering is $-0-.

2015    Offering    - During September 2015, the Company commenced an offering of units and, as of September 30, 2016, raised a total of $85,000 of investment proceeds.  

WL Meyer Legacy Trust (formerly    CMS Acquisition, LLC  )     N  ote Payable   -  In September 2010, the Company issued a note in the amount of $100,000 (interest at 6.0% per annum through May 15, 2011 and 10.0% thereafter and secured by a security interest in the PSC Patent) and issued warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.05 per share.

Summary of Cash Flow Act ivity   

Net cash used by operating activities  

During the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used by operating activities was impacted primarily by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.  

Net cash provided by financing activities  

Net cash provided by financing  activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to investments in our Equity Offering of $110  ,000 and in a Note Payable of $50,000, offset by note payable payments of $15  ,000. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due to investments in our Equity Offering of $10  0,000 and an investment in a note payable offering of $85,000, offset by note payable payments of $6,000.   

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

In the table below, we set forth our obligations as of  September 30, 2016. Some of the figures we include in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their durations, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. The obligations we may pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in this table because of estimates or actions of third parties as disclosed in the notes to the table.  

(1) Represents value of principal amount of notes and estimates for interest. The notes are with various individuals, carry one-year or 18-month terms and are convertible into shares of Common Stock at the noteholders option. As of September 30, 2016, approx. $3.6 million of these notes have matured (including interest). We will work with the noteholders to refinance, convert or repay the notes. 

(2) Represents the value of principal and interest, secured by a security interest in the PSC Patent, and was due September 17, 2016.

Off-   B  alance   S  heet   A  rrangements   

We have  no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting issues require management estimates and judgments for the preparation of financial statements. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions.  

We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments relating to  long-lived assets, convertible notes and warrants, fair-value measurement, share-based compensation and income tax matters have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2016. Our critical accounting policies and estimate assumptions have not changed during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    -  Not applicable.  

Item 4T. Controls and Procedures  

Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Security and Exchange Commission s rules and regulations. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives  outlined above. Based on their most recent evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective at that reasonable assurance level at September 30, 2016. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, including, but not limited to having one full-time employee (chief executive officer), and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.   

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings    -  None  

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

In addition  to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any forward-looking statements. The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in these cautionary statements are in addition to those contained in any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed in connection with a forward-looking statement or contained in any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I   tem   2. U  nregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

In August 2013, the Company commenced an offering of units, under a Subscription Agreement, at a purchase price of $1,000 per unit  (Equity Offering 8/13). Each unit consists of: (i) 10,000 shares of the Company s authorized but unissued restricted Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase 30,000 additional shares of Common Stock for a three-year period from the date of issuance of the units at an initial exercise price of $0.15 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the Company raised a total of $663,500 of investment proceeds.   The issuance of units and the issuance of Common Stock were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act ( Rule 506 ) and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  

In  February 2016, the Company issued 4,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to a member of management and certain members of the Company s Board of Directors in consideration for services. These shares were issued in a private transaction in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  

In June 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of 25 Van Keuren LLC  ( Van Keuren ), and issued in the aggregate 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company (par value $0.001) to certain holders of membership interests in Van Keuren (the  Holders ). As of the close of business on June 23, 2016, the Company stock quote was $0.05. The issuance of the securities to the Holders under the acquisition agreement was conducted in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  

I   tem   3. D  efaults Upon Senior Securities   

Certain promissory notes in our offering of units comprised of a convertible promissory note and a warrant , commenced in April 2009 (2009, 11/10, 5/12, and 2/14 Offerings) are due. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $3.6 million (including approximately $850,000 of accrued interest) was due and payable. We plan to work with each remaining note holder to exchange, or convert, these promissory notes. There can be no assurance that we will reach agreements with any or all of these note holders and we may be required to repay such amounts.
