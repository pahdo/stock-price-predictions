    SEPTEMBER 30, 2016     

    (unaudited)     

Note 1. General Information     

WideOpenWest Finance, LLC ("WOW") was organized in Delaware on November 13, 2001 and is wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Racecar
Acquisition, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Racecar Holdings, LLC (the "Parent"). In the following context, the terms WOW or the "Company" may refer, as the context requires,
to WOW or, collectively, WOW and its subsidiaries. See further discussion in Note 9 Income Taxes, regarding the Company's ownership structure.   

The
Company is a fully integrated provider of high-speed data ("HSD"), cable television ("Video"), and digital telephony ("Telephony") services. The Company serves markets in twenty
Midwestern and Southeastern markets in the United States. The Company manages and operates its Midwestern broadband cable systems in Detroit and Lansing, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland and
Columbus, Ohio; Evansville, Indiana; Baltimore, Maryland and Lawrence, Kansas. The Southeastern systems are located in Augusta, Columbus, Newnan and West Point, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina;
Dothan, Auburn, Huntsville and Montgomery, Alabama; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Panama City and Pinellas County, Florida.   

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation      

          The financial statements presented herein include the consolidated accounts of WideOpenWest Finance, LLC and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates as one operating segment.   

Pursuant
to the operating agreement of Parent, as amended (the "Operating Agreement"), the Parent has issued various classes of common units. Because the Parent's primary assets are its
investment in the Company, the Parent's ownership structure has been "pushed down" to the Company. All of the Company's ownership units and unit holders discussed herein are legally the Parent's.   

          The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required by GAAP or
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and regulations for complete financial statements. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all normally recurring adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements have been included, and the financial statements present fairly
the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the full
year or any future period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, together with
management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016.

    (unaudited)    

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)    

Use of Estimates      

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, derivative financial instruments and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. However, due to
the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.   

Recently Issued Accounting Standards      

          In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15 to topic 230,
Statement of Cash Flows, making changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in order to reduce diversity in presentation. This update is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues, of which only one is applicable to our financial statements.
The Company does not believe that the adoption of this prouncement will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)    Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09") which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payments to employees. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 requires all
income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled rather than recording excess tax benefits or deficiencies in additional paid-in capital. The
guidance in ASU 2016-09 also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability
accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this prouncement will have a
material impact on its condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   

          In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    "Leases (Topic 842)"    ("ASU 2016-02"). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be
required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a
lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial
statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance
beginning with its first quarter ending March 31, 2019. The Company is in the process of evaluating the future

  impact
of ASU 2016-02 on its condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   

          In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".    ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue
recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that
core principle, an entity is required to follow five steps which are comprised of (a) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (b) identifying the performance obligations in the
contract; (c) determining the transaction price; (d) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (e) recognizing revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies a performance obligation. On August 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year until January 1, 2018. On March 2016, early
adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted by applying the provisions of the new standard on a retrospective basis to the periods included in the financial
statements or on a modified retrospective basis which would result in the recognition of a cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2017, if adopting early, otherwise in the
first quarter of 2018. The Company has not yet decided which implementation method it will adopt. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting the new standard.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)    ("ASU 2016-08"),
which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance
and illustrations in ASC 606. The FASB issued ASU 2016-08 in response to concerns identified by stakeholders, including those related to determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue
standard's principal-versus-agent guidance and applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard's control principle. ASU 2016-08 has the
same effective date as ASU 2014-09 and requires adopting ASU 2016-08 by using the same transition method used to adopt ASU 2014-09. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting
the new standard.   

          In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,    Narrow-Scope improvements and Practical Expedients    ("ASU 2016-12"), which amends certain aspects
of ASU 2014-09. The amendments address certain implementation issues and clarify, rather than change, the standard's core revenue recognition principles which include clarity on collectability,
presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and transition technical corrections.
ASU 2016-12 has the same effective date as ASU 2014-09 and requires adopting ASU 2016-12 by using the same transition method used to adopt ASU 2014-09. The Company is in the process of
assessing the impact of adopting the new standard.   

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements      

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, S   implifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   
which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance

  sheet
as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption of this
pronouncement has been reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has adjusted the accompanying December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet by decreasing
long term debt by $35.4 million. See further disclosure in Note 6 Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases.   

          In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,    Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes    ("ASU 2015-17"), which requires
that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 will be effective for interim and annuals periods beginning after December 15,
2016 and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption of the
standard is permitted. The Company early adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2016 and has applied prospective treatment. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on
the Company's results of operation, financial condition or cash flows. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.   

Note 3. Crestview Transaction     

On December 18, 2015, funds managed by Crestview Advisors, L.L.C. ("Crestview"), a private equity firm based in New York, and Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview
Partners III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of Parent. Under terms of the agreement (the "Crestview Purchase Agreement"), Crestview's funds purchased
units held by Avista and other unitholders, and made a $125 million primary investment in newly-issued units. Crestview has extensive experience in the telecommunications industry and the
Company believes that this investment will help it capitalize on future growth opportunities.   

On
April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in the Company's Parent.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, $50.0 million of proceeds from these transactions have been contributed down to the Company while the remaining $93.2 million, net of
accrued and paid transaction expenses, have been recorded to the Company's Parent's balance sheet and have not been pushed down and reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Note 4. Property and Equipment     

Property and equipment consisted of the following:   

Depreciation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $48.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $141.8 million and $147.0 million, respectively. Included in depreciation expense were gains (losses) on write-offs or sales of head-end and customer premise equipment totaling
$0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Assets Held for Sale      

          During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to actively market the sale of its
Lawrence, Kansas Systems. As a result of this plan, the Company concluded that as of September 30, 2016, these assets and liabilities met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale.
See Note 13 Subsequent Events for further details on the signing of the Asset Purchase Agreement between Midco, Inc. and the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the
Lawrence, Kansas Systems had $174.5 million in total assets and $45.0 million in total liabilities and were included in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.   

Newnan Acquisition      

          On September 9, 2016, the Company consummated its Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire substantially all of the operating assets of HC
Cable Opco, LLC, d/b/a NuLink, a privately-held company based in Newnan, Georgia. The purchase price of $54.3 million is subject to normal and customary purchase price adjustments and

Note 6. Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases (Continued)    

  and
the other parties thereto. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement.   

The
Sixth Amendment, among other provisions, provides for the addition of a new $2.065 billion seven year Term B Loan which bears interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus
3.50% or ABR plus 2.50% and includes a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The new Term B Loan has a maturity date of August 19, 2023, unless the earlier maturity dates set forth below are triggered under the
following circumstances. The Term B Loan will mature on April 15, 2019 if (i) any of the Company's existing outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes are outstanding on April 15, 2019,
or (ii) any future indebtedness with a final maturity date prior to the date that is 91 days after August 19, 2023 is incurred to refinance the Company's existing Senior Unsecured
Notes. The Term B Loan will mature on July 15, 2019 if (i) any of the Company's existing Senior Subordinated Notes are outstanding on July 15, 2019, or (ii) any
indebtedness with a final maturity prior to the date that is 91 days after August 19, 2023 is incurred to refinance the Company's existing Senior Subordinated Notes.   

          Proceeds
from the issuance of the new Term B Loans were used to repay in full the existing $1.825 billion Term B Loan, which had a maturity date of April 15, 2019 and which
bore interest at the same rates described above. The Company used the remaining $240.0 million in proceeds to fund the Company's acquisition of NuLink and to redeem a portion of the Company's
13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.5 million, primarily representing the expensing third party arranger fees and the unamortized debt
issuance costs related to a portion of the former Term B Loans.   

Senior Subordinated Notes pay down      

          On July 15, 2016, the Company utilized existing cash balances and working capital funds to make a total $69.7 million payment
towards the 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. Such payment included a partial redemption totaling $46.9 million of the outstanding principal balance of the notes, call premium of
$3.1 million, the payment of accrued interest on the notes of $19.7 million and $0.9 million in expensing of unamortize debt issuance cost in connection with the redemption.   

On
September 15, 2016, we redeemed an additional $159.1 million in principal amount outstanding of our 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition to the principal
redemption, we paid $10.7 million in call premium, $3.5 million in accrued interest and $2.9 million in expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the
redemption. Following the redemption, $89.0 million in principal amount remains outstanding under the Notes.   

Refinancing of Term B Loans and payoff of Term B-1 Loans      

          On May 11, 2016, the Company entered into a fifth amendment (the "Fifth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated as of July 17,
2012, as amended on April 1, 2013, November 27, 2013, May 21, 2015 and July 1, 2015 (the "Original Credit Agreement") among the Company and the other parties thereto.

Note 6. Long-Term Debt and Capital Leases (Continued)     

The Fifth Amendment, among other provisions, provided for the addition of an incremental $432.5 million in new Term B Loans, having a maturity date in April 2019 and which bear
interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.50% or ABR plus 2.50% and includes a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Proceeds from the issuance of the new Term B Loans were used to repay all remaining
$382.5 million outstanding principal under the Company's Term B-1 Loans which had a maturity date of July 2017 and which bore interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.00% or ABR plus
2.00% and which included a 0.75% LIBOR floor. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million, primarily representing the expensing of the unamortized debt issuance costs
related to a portion of the former Term B-1 Loans.   

Revolver Extension      

          On July 1, 2015, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated as of
July 17, 2012, as amended on April 1, 2013, November 27, 2013 and May 21, 2015 (the "Original Credit Agreement") among the Company and the other parties thereto.   

Under
the Original Credit Agreement, the Company had $200.0 million of borrowings available under its revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), which was to mature as of
July 17, 2017. Under the Fourth Amendment, the maturity date of $180.0 million of the $200.0 million in available borrowings under the Revolver is extended until July 1,
2020 provided that (i) the Company has no Term B Loans outstanding as of January 1, 2019 and (ii) any indebtedness incurred to refinance the Term B Loans has a maturity date no
earlier than September 30, 2020. If either condition in provisos (i) and (ii) above is not satisfied as of January 1, 2019, then the Revolver will mature on
January 1, 2019. In addition, in the event the Company has outstanding borrowings under the Revolver in excess of $180.0 million as of July 17, 2017, the Company would be required
to pay down such borrowings to the extent of such excess.   

Refinancing of Term B and B-1 Loans      

          On May 21, 2015, the Company entered into a third amendment (the "Third Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated as of July 17,
2012, as amended on April 1, 2013 and as further amended on November 27, 2013 among the Company and the other parties thereto.   

The
Third Amendment, among other provisions, provides for a refinancing of the Credit Agreement, resulting in $1,411.4 million in new Term B Loans, which bear interest, at the
Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.50% or ABR plus 2.50% and includes a 1% LIBOR floor. The new Term B Loans replace the $1,560.4 million in outstanding Term B Loans which were previously
priced, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.75% or ABR plus 2.75%. The proceeds from the refinancing were used to pay outstanding principal under the Company's current Term B Loans. In connection
with the Third Amendment, the Company made a prepayment totaling $150.0 million, applied ratably, to the Company's outstanding Term B Loans and outstanding Term B-1 Loans. Proceeds from the
sale of the Company's South Dakota Systems were used in connection with the prepayment. In addition, the Third Amendment provides for the ability to refinance the Company's Senior Subordinated Notes
with proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt

  of
$22.9 million, primarily representing the expensing of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to a portion of the former Term B Loans.   

The
obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Members and its subsidiaries and are secured on a first priority basis by substantially all of the
tangible and intangible assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Amendment contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes are usual
and customary for a senior secured credit agreement. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale of assets, investments, dividends, subordinated debt
payments and amendments, sale leasebacks and transactions with the Company's affiliates. The Credit Amendment also requires the Company to comply with a maximum senior secured leverage ratio. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016.   

Note 7. Financial Information for Subsidiary Guarantors     

The subsidiary guarantors of the Notes are wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by WOW and have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, to each holder of the
Notes, the full and prompt performance of WOW's and the co-issuer's obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes, including the payment of principal and interest on the Notes. WOW
has no independent assets or operations, and there are no significant restrictions on the ability of its consolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to WOW in the form of cash dividends, loans or
advances. Based on these facts, and in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10,    "Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities
registered or being registered,"    WOW is not required to provide condensed consolidating financial information for the subsidiary guarantors.   

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements     

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, trade payable, short-term borrowings and the current portions of long-term debt approximate carrying values due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. For assets and liabilities of a long-term nature, the Company determines fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Market or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed
by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs. The Company applies the following hierarchy in determining fair
value:  

Level 1, defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;    
            Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value
drivers are observable in active markets; and   
            Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made
by other participants therefore requiring assumptions

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements (Continued)    

based
on the best information available. A summary of the Company's liabilities measured at fair values that are included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are as follows (by respective
level of fair value hierarchy):

(1)    The
fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps were determined using cash flow valuation models. The inputs to the cash flow models consist of, or are
derived from, observable data for substantially the full term of the swaps. This observable data includes interest and swap rates, yield curves and credit ratings, which are retrieved from available
market data. The valuations are then adjusted for the Company's own nonperformance risk as well as the counterparty's as required by the provisions of the authoritative guidance using a discounted
cash flow technique that accounts for the duration of the interest rate swaps and the profile of Company and the counterparty.
      (2)    The
fair value of the interest rate caps were calculated using a cash flow valuation model. The main inputs were obtained from quoted market prices, the LIBOR
interest rate and the projected three months LIBOR. The observable market quotes were then input into the valuation and discounted to reflect the time value of cash.     

Accordingly,
the valuations of assets and liabilities related to the derivative instruments fell under Level 2 of the authoritative guidance fair value hierarchy. There were no
transfers into or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

          The
estimated fair value at September 30, 2016 of the Company's long-term debt (note 6), which includes debt subject to the effects of interest rate risk, was based on
dealer quotes considering current market rates and was approximately $3,015.7 million, compared to a gross carrying value of $2,979.0 million and, therefore, is categorized as a
Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

Note 9. Income Taxes     

On April 1, 2016, the Company consummated a restructuring where it became wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. Previously, the Company was owned by WideOpenWest
Illinois, Inc., WideOpenWest Ohio, Inc., WOW Sigecom, Inc. and WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. (collectively, the "Members"). The Members were wholly owned subsidiaries of Racecar
Acquisition, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Racecar Holdings, LLC (the "Parent"). As a result of the restructuring, the Company became a single member LLC for federal
income tax purposes and its taxable income will be
reported on WideOpenWest Kite, Inc.'s federal income tax return. Under ASC 740, the restructuring is treated as a change in tax status due to a single member LLC being required to record
current and deferred income taxes on a separate return basis reflecting the results of its operations. Previously, the Company has only been required to record current and deferred income taxes
relating to its C corporation subsidiaries. The Company does not anticipate that the restructuring will have any significant impact on future operating cash flows as the Company's Parent and
its subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that would significantly reduce any required prospective tax payments.   

The
components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the table below. Total current
deferred income taxes are included in prepaid expense and other in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets:   

The
Company recorded total income tax benefits (expense) of $5.2 million and $(143.4) million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The
change in tax status

Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued)    

  resulted
in a deferred tax expense of $154.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Also, as a result of the Company's change in tax status, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit due to a reversal of a portion of its existing valuation allowance in the amount of $27.6 million. In addition, the Company
recorded income tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefit of $18.7 million and current and deferred tax benefit from operations of $2.6 million. The Company does not anticipate
that the tax expense will have any significant impact on future operating cash flows as the Company's Parent and its subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that would significantly reduce
any required prospective tax payments.   

          The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the
financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse. Additionally, the impact of changes in the tax rates
and laws on deferred taxes, if any, is reflected in the financial statements in the period of enactment.   

          The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. For federal tax purposes, the Company's 2012 through 2015 tax years remain open
for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three year statute of limitations. Generally, for state tax purposes, the Company's 2012 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by
the tax authorities under a three year statute of limitations. Should the Company utilize any of its U.S. or state loss carryforwards, their carryforward losses, which date back to 1995, would be
subject to examination.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $25.3 million, all of which if recognized would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
The Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of $3.4 million. Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could
be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.   

          The
Company is not currently under examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but does have various open tax controversy matters with various state taxing authorities. The
unrecognized tax benefits relate to issues associated with the acquisition of Knology and various state income tax matters.   

Note 10. Profit Interest Plan     

On February 3, 2016, the Parent adopted a new Profit Interest Plan (the "2016 Profit Interest Plan") pursuant to which the Board of Parent may grant 295,667 Management Incentive
Units ("Incentive Units"), or approximately 8% of the total outstanding units of Parent, excluding Incentive Units, to
employees, managers, officers, directors, and consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In general, if incentive Units under the 2016 Profit Interest Plan for any reason are cancelled,
forfeited, expired or terminated, such Incentive Units will be available for the further grant of awards under the 2016 Profit Interest Plan.

Note 10. Profit Interest Plan (Continued)    

          Incentive
Units granted under the 2016 Profit Interests Plan are intended to constitute a "profits interest" in the Parent for tax purposes. Generally, these Incentive Units are subject
to a combination of time, performance, and market-based vesting conditions. Upon vesting, the award recipient receives a Class D unit in the Parent. Such Class D units represent a right
to a fractional portion of the profits and distributions of Parent in excess of a "floor amount" determined in accordance with the Operating Agreement. The Class D units are in a secondary
position to the other outstanding classes of units in the Parent, in that in any event in which the equity is valued and paid out, holders of the Class D units are only paid if an amount at
least equal to the applicable floor amount is first allocated to all of the outstanding classes of units under the Operating Agreement.   

          Additionally,
on July 18, 2016, the Company adopted a Director Appreciation Rights Plan ("2016 Director Plan"), in which 10% of the aggregate value of the 2016 Profit Interest
Plan has been reserved for the 2016 Director Plan. The participants of the 2016 Director Plan are granted non-voting Bonus Units which vest ratably, 25% each anniversary date from grant date and fully
vest four years from grant date. At no time will the participants own any Units of the Company but will have rights to participate in the Bonus Pool upon a Liquidity event based on vesting. The Bonus
Pool shall be determined by the Administrator of the Plan at each Liquidity Event. Upon a Participant's termination of employment all vested an unvested Bonus Units are forfeited.   

2016 Executive Officer Grants      

          On May 31, 2016, the Board granted 195,997 of Incentive Units to various executive officers and members of the board of directors of the
Parent and its subsidiaries.   

          The
97,998 of Incentive Units granted (the "Time Vesting Units") vest ratably at 25% per year beginning on December 18, 2016 and assuming the award recipient continues to be
employed by the Parent or its subsidiaries. Vesting of the Time Vesting Units shall be accelerated upon a Liquidity Event as defined in the respective grant agreements, subject to achieving certain
performance targets.
The aggregate grant date fair value of the Time Vesting Units was $6.3 million, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of approximately four years.   

          The
remaining 97,999 of the Incentive Units granted (the "Performance Vesting Units") vest upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event as defined in the respective grant agreements, subject
to achieving certain performance targets upon the Liquidity Event. The aggregate grant date fair value of the Performance Vesting Units granted was $4.3 million, which will be recognized upon
the occurrence of said Liquidity Event.   

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies     

The Company is party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and -putative class actions) arising in the normal course of its business covering a wide range of matters
and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of access, programming, taxes, fees and surcharges, consumer protection, trademark and patent
infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers.

accrues an expense for pending litigation when it determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are
expensed as incurred. None of the Company's existing accruals for pending matters is material. WOW regularly monitors its pending litigation for the purpose of adjusting its accruals and revising its
disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is, however, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. The Company vigorously defends its interests in
pending litigation, and as of this date, WOW believes that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering
insurance coverage or other indemnities to which it is entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on its condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   

Note 12. Related Party Transactions     

The Company pays a quarterly management fee plus travel and miscellaneous expenses, if any, to Avista and Crestview (the majority unit holders of the Parent). Such management fee is
$0.4 million per quarter.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued dividends to its Parent and its Members for payments of federal income taxes in the amount of $4.8 and
$4.7 million, respectively. As of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the receivable from the Parent and its Members amounted to $0.3 million and
$0.3 million.   

Note 13. Subsequent Events     

On October 21, 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement under which Midco, Inc. will acquire substantially all of the operating assets of the
Company's Lawrence, Kansas System for gross proceeds of approximately $215.0 million in cash, subject to certain normal and customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the agreement. The
transaction is expected to close either late in the fourth quarter of 2016 or early in the first quarter of 2017.

Forward-Looking Statements     

          Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical facts contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent our goals, beliefs, plans and expectations about our prospects for the

"could," "would," "anticipate," "expect," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "project," "predict," "potential," or the negative of these terms. Although these forward-looking statements reflect our
good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information, these statements are qualified by important factors, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to:  

the wide range of competition we face in our business;   
            conditions in the economy, including economic uncertainty or downturn, unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;    
            our ability to offset increased direct costs, particularly programming, with price increases;   
            plans to develop future networks and upgrade facilities;   
            the current and future markets for our services and products;   
            competitive and technological developments;   
            our exposure to the credit risk of customers, vendors and other third parties;   
            possible acquisitions, alliances or dispositions;   
            the effects of regulatory changes on our business;   
            our substantial level of indebtedness;   
            certain covenants in our debt documents;   
            our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in the expected time frame or at all;    
            our ability to manage the risks involved in the foregoing;    

and
other factors described from time to time in our reports filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and in particular those factors set forth in the section
entitled "Risk Factors" on our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2016 and other reports subsequently filed with the SEC. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue

Montgomery, Alabama; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Panama City and Pinellas County, Florida. Our primary business is the delivery of bundled communication services over our own network. In addition to our
bundled package offerings, we sell these services on an unbundled basis. We have built our business through (i) acquisitions of cable systems, (ii) upgrades of acquired networks to
introduce expanded broadband services including bundled high-speed data, video and telephony services, (iii) construction and expansion of our broadband network to offer integrated high-speed
data, video and telephony services and (iv) organic growth of connections through increased penetration of services to new marketable homes and our existing customer base. At
September 30, 2016, our networks passed 3,075 thousand homes and served 801 thousand total customers, reflecting a total customer penetration rate of approximately 26%.   

          Our
most significant competitors are other cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and
functionality similar to our HSD, Video and Telephony services. We believe that our strategy of operating primarily in secondary markets provides better operating and financial stability compared to
the more competitive environments in large metropolitan markets. We have a history of successfully competing in chosen markets despite the presence of competing incumbent providers through attractive
high value bundling of our services and investments in new service offerings.   

          We
believe that a decline in the U.S. economy, including a downturn in the housing market or increase in unemployment rates, may adversely affect consumer demand for our services.
Additional capital and credit market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which could also lead to lower demand for our products and lower levels of advertising sales. A slowdown in
growth of the housing
market could severely affect consumer confidence and may cause increased delinquencies or cancellations by our customers or lead to unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased.   

          In
addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to
which we delegate certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect
vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. In addition, programming costs are a
significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and additional service offerings.   

Crestview Partners      

          On December 18, 2015, funds managed by Crestview Advisors, L.L.C., a private equity firm based in New York, and Parent consummated a
transaction whereby Crestview Partners III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of Parent. Under terms of the agreement (the "Crestview Purchase Agreement"),
Crestview's funds purchased units held by Avista and other unitholders, and also made a $125.0 million primary investment in newly-issued units. Crestview has extensive experience in the
telecommunications and we believe this investment will help us capitalize on future growth opportunities.   

          On
April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our Parent.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, $50.0 million of proceeds from these transactions have been contributed down to us while the remaining $93.2 million, net of accrued and
paid transaction expenses, have been recorded to our Parent's balance sheet and have not been pushed down and reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Term B Loans Refinancing      

          On August 19, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment ("Sixth Amendment") to our Credit Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2012, as
amended ("Credit Agreement") among us and the other parties thereto. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement.   

          The
Sixth Amendment, among other provisions, provides for the addition of a new $2.065 billion seven year Term B Loan which bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 3.50% or
ABR plus 2.50% and includes a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The new Term B Loan has a maturity date of August 19, 2023, unless the earlier maturity dates set forth below are triggered under the following
circumstances. The Term B Loan will mature on April 15, 2019 if (i) any of our existing outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes are outstanding on April 15, 2019, or (ii) any
future indebtedness with a final maturity date prior to the date that is 91 days after August 19, 2023 is incurred to refinance our existing Senior Unsecured Notes. The Term B Loan will
mature on July 15, 2019 if (i) any of the Company's existing Senior Subordinated Notes are outstanding on July 15, 2019, or (ii) any indebtedness with a final maturity
prior to the date that is 91 days after August 19, 2023 is incurred to refinance the Company's existing Senior Subordinated Notes.   

          Proceeds
from the issuance of the new Term B Loans were used to repay in full the existing $1.825 billion Term B Loan, which had a maturity date of April 15, 2019 and which
bore interest at the same rates described above. We used the remaining $240.0 million in proceeds to fund our acquisition of Nulink and to redeem a portion of our 13.38% Senior Subordinated
Notes, as described below. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10.4 million, primarily representing the expensing of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to a
portion of the former Term B Loans.   

Senior Subordinated Notes pay down      

          On July 15, 2016, we utilized existing cash balances and working capital funds to make a total $69.7 million payment towards the
13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. Such payment included a partial redemption totaling $46.9 million of the outstanding principal balance of the notes, call premium of $3.1 million and
the payment of accrued interest on the notes of $19.7 million.   

          On
September 15, 2016, we redeemed an additional $159.1 million in principal amount outstanding of our 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition to the principal
redemption, we paid $10.7 million in call premium, $3.5 million in accrued interest and $0.9 million in expensing of unamortized debt
issuance costs in connection with the redemption. Following the redemption, $89.0 million in principal amount remains outstanding under the Notes.   

Refinancing of Term B Loans and payoff of Term B-1 Loans      

          On May 11, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment (the "Fifth Amendment") to our Credit Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2012, as
amended on April 1, 2013, November 27, 2013, May 21, 2015 and July 1, 2015 (the "Original Credit Agreement") among us and the other parties thereto.   

          The
Fifth Amendment, among other provisions, provides for the addition of an incremental $432.5 million in new Term B Loans, having a maturity date in April 2019 and which bear
interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.50% or ABR plus 2.50% and includes a 1.00% LIBOR floor. Proceeds from the issuance of the new Term B Loans were used to repay all remaining
$382.5 million outstanding principal under the Company's Term B-1 Loans which had a maturity date of July 2017 and which bore interest, at the Company's option, at LIBOR plus 3.00% or ABR plus
2.00% and which included a 0.75% LIBOR floor. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million, primarily representing the expensing of the unamortized debt issuance costs
related to a portion of the former Term B-1 Loans.

Revolver Extension      

          On July 1, 2015, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, dated as of
July 17, 2012, as amended on April 1, 2013, November 27, 2013 and May 21, 2015 (the "Original Credit Agreement") among the Company and the other parties thereto.   

          Under
the Original Credit Agreement, the Company had $200.0 million of borrowings available under its revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), which was to mature as of
July 17, 2017. Under the Fourth
Amendment, the maturity date of $180.0 million of the $200.0 million in available borrowings under the Revolver is extended until July 1, 2020 provided that (i) the Company
has no Term B Loans outstanding as of January 1, 2019 and (ii) any indebtedness incurred to refinance the Term B Loans has a maturity date no earlier than September 30, 2020. If
either condition in provisions (i) and (ii) above is not satisfied as of January 1, 2019, then the Revolver will mature on January 1, 2019. In addition, in the event the
Company has outstanding borrowings under the Revolver in excess of $180.0 million as of July 17, 2017, the Company would be required to pay down such borrowings to the extent of such
excess.   

Newnan Acquisition      

          On September 9, 2016, we finalized our acquisition of HC Cable Opco, LLC d/b/a Nulink in Newnan, Georgia for $54.3 million,
all of which we paid in cash. The acquisition will extend our high-speed Internet, cable TV and phone service and award-winning customer support experience to more than 34,000 additional homes and
businesses. The acquisition of Newnan is reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016.   

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     

          In the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions we believe
are reasonable based upon the information available, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The estimates and assumptions affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies are
defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and
conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account for
these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change.   

Valuation of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets      

            Carrying Value.       The aggregate carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets (including franchise operating rights
and goodwill)
comprised approximately 95% and 93% of our total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

          Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and include costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities, and new service installations at the
customer location. Capitalized costs include materials, labor, and certain indirect costs attributable to the capitalization activity. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or
retirement of an asset, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the related accounts and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operating results. We make judgments regarding the
installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor associated with capitalizable activities and indirect cost using standards developed from operational data,
including the proportionate time to perform a new installation relative to the total technical operations activities and an evaluation of the nature of the   

  25  

Table of Contents   

  indirect
costs incurred to support capitalizable activities. Judgment is required to determine the extent to which indirect costs incurred relate to capitalizable activities, and as a result should be
capitalized. Indirect costs include (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable cost of installation and construction vehicle
costs, (iii) the direct variable costs of support personnel directly involved in assisting with installation activities, such as dispatchers and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable
to capitalizable activities.   

          Intangible
assets consist primarily of acquired franchise operating rights, customer relationships and goodwill. Franchise operating rights represent the value attributable to agreements
with local franchising authorities, which allows access to homes in the public right of way. Our franchise operating rights were acquired through business combinations. We do not amortize cable
franchise operating rights as we have determined they have an indefinite life. Costs incurred in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are expensed as incurred. Customer relationships
represent the value of the benefit to us of acquiring the existing subscriber base and are amortized over the estimated life of the subscriber base, generally four years, on a straight-line basis.
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired in business combinations.   

            Asset Impairments.       Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for
impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less
than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset.   

We
evaluate the recoverability of our franchise operating rights at least annually on October 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances
indicate the assets might be impaired. Franchise operating rights are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value. We calculate the
fair value of franchise operating rights using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income approach which calculates the value of an intangible asset by discounting its future cash flows. The
fair value is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flows attributable to each franchise operating right intangible asset using assumptions consistent with internal forecasts.
Key assumptions in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, revenue and subscriber growth rates (less anticipated customer churn), operating expenditures, capital
expenditures (including any build out), market share achieved, contributory asset charge rates, tax rates and discount rate. The discount rate used in the model represents a weighted average cost of
capital and the perceived risk associated with an intangible asset such as our franchise operating rights. The estimates and assumptions made in our valuations are inherently subject to significant
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a
variation which would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth, programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures and
the discount rate utilized.   

          We
also, at least annually on October 1, evaluate our goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit (which generally are represented by geographical operations of cable systems
we manage). For evaluation of our goodwill, we utilize discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare such value to the carrying amount of the reporting
unit. In the event the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we would be required to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the unit was acquired in a
business combination, thereby revaluing goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the revalued goodwill would be expensed as an impairment loss.

Fair Value Measurements      

          GAAP provides guidance for a framework for measuring fair value in the form of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Financial assets and liabilities are classified by level in their entirety based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability due to the fact there is no market activity. We record our interest rate swaps at fair value on
the balance sheet and perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to these derivative financial instruments. The fair value measurements of our interest rate swaps (which expired on
July 1, 2016) were determined using cash flow valuation models. The inputs to the cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable data for substantially the full term of the swaps.
This observable data includes interest and swap rates, yield curves and credit ratings, which are retrieved from available market data. The valuations are then adjusted for our own nonperformance risk
as well as the counterparty as required by the provisions of the authoritative guidance using a discounted cash flow technique that accounts for the duration of the interest rate swaps and our and the
counterparty's risk profile.   

          We
also have non-recurring valuations primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we
make fair value determinations as of the applicable valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but
not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the
amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third- party valuation
specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, and any impairment charges that we may report. Our estimates of fair value are based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of acquisition accounting
and all of our long-lived assets are subject to periodic or event-driven impairment assessments.   

Legal and other contingencies      

          Legal and other contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is
established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a
matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. The actual costs of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of reserve we recorded. In addition,
in the normal course of business, we are subject to various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings directed at or involving us, which in our opinion will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position or results of operations or liquidity.

Programming Agreements      

          We exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record
video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at
agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we
continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status
of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new
contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service
interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.   

          Significant
judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements which result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales,
channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. In these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a
reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).   

Income Taxes      

          From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include
business acquisitions and dispositions, including dispositions designed to be tax free, issues related to consideration paid or received, and issues relating to investments and certain financing
transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on interpretation of tax laws and
regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax, interest and penalty assessments by
these taxing authorities. In determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain income tax positions unless such positions are determined to be
more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on technical merits. That is, for financial reporting purposes, we only recognize tax benefits taken on the tax return that we believe
are more likely than not of being sustained. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained.   

We
adjust our tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and
interpretations. The consolidated income tax provision of any given year includes adjustments to prior year income tax accruals that we consider appropriate and any related estimated interest. Our
policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as part of income tax provision.   

          On
April 1, 2016, we consummated a restructuring where we became wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. Previously, we were owned by WideOpenWest Illinois, Inc.,
WideOpenWest Ohio, Inc., WOW Sigecom, Inc. and WideOpenWest Kite, Inc. (collectively, the "Members"). The Members were wholly owned subsidiaries of Racecar
Acquisition, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Racecar Holdings, LLC (the "Parent"). As a result of the restructuring, we became a single member LLC for federal income
tax purposes and our taxable income will be reported on WideOpenWest Kite, Inc.'s federal income tax return. Under ASC 740, the restructuring is treated as a change in tax status due to a
single member LLC being required to record current and deferred   

  28  

Table of Contents   

  income
taxes on a separate return basis reflecting the results of its operations. Previously, we have only been required to record current and deferred income taxes relating to our C corporation
subsidiaries. We do not anticipate that the restructuring will have any significant impact on our future operating cash flows as our Parent and its subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards
that would significantly reduce any required prospective tax payments.   

Homes Passed and Subscribers     

          We report homes passed as the number of residential units, such as single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by our
broadband network and listed in our database. We report Video subscribers as the number of basic cable subscribers, excluding customers who only subscribe to HSD or Telephony services in this total.
We define Total RGUs (Revenue Generating Units) as the sum of HSD subscribers, video subscribers and telephony subscribers. The following table summarizes homes passed, total customers, subscribers
and total RGU's for our services as of each respective date (in thousands):   

(1)    Defined
as number of customers who receive at least one of our HSD, Video or Telephony services that we count as a subscriber, without regard to which or how many
services they subscribe.
      (2)    Includes
subscriber numbers from our Newnan, Georgia asset purchase on September 9, 2016.     

Subscriber
information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in
accordance with our policies. While we take appropriate steps to ensure subscriber information is presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, we periodically review
our policies in light of the variability we may encounter across our different markets due to the nature and pricing of products and services and billing systems. Accordingly, we may from time to time
make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber information based on such reviews.   

Financial Statement Presentation     

Revenue      

          Our operating revenue is primarily derived from monthly charges for HSD, Video, and Telephony to residential and commercial customers, other
commercial services, advertising and other revenues.   

HSD revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for data service and rental of cable modems.   
            Video revenue consists of fixed monthly fees for basic, premium and digital cable television services and rental of video converter equipment,
as well as fees from pay-per-view, video-on-demand and other events that involve a charge for each viewing.    
 
  29  

Table of Contents   

Telephony revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees for local service and enhanced services, such as call waiting, voice mail and
measured and flat rate long-distance service.   
            Other commercial service revenue consists of session initiated protocol, web hosting, metro Ethernet, wireless backhaul, advanced collocation
and cloud infrastructure services.   
            Other revenue consists primarily of franchise and other regulatory fees (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities),
advertising, commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services, fees from other services and installation services.    

Revenues
attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our HSD, Video and Telephony services provided by our cable systems were 87% and 89% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The remaining approximately 10% of non-subscription revenue is derived primarily from franchise and other regulatory fees (which are collected by us
but then paid to local authorities), advertising revenues, and installation services.   

Costs and Expenses      

          Our expenses primarily consist of operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and interest
expense.   

             Operating expenses    primarily include programming costs, data costs, transport costs and network access fees related to our HSD and
Telephony services, cable service related expenses, costs of dark fiber sales, network operations and maintenance services, customer service and call center expenses, bad debt, billing and collection
expenses, franchise fees and other regulatory fees.   

             Selling, general and administrative expenses    primarily include salaries and benefits of corporate and field management, sales and
marketing personnel, human resources and related administrative costs.   

             Depreciation and amortization expenses    include depreciation of our broadband networks and equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements
and amortization of other intangible assets with definite lives primarily related to acquisitions.   

Realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments, net    includes adjustments to fair value for the various interest rate swaps and
caps we enter into on the required portions of our outstanding variable debt. As we do not use hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes, at the end of each reporting period, the adjustments
to fair value of our interest rate swaps and caps are recorded to earnings.   

          We
control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls on expenditures. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure by improving workforce productivity,
increasing the effectiveness of our purchasing activities and maintaining discipline in customer acquisition. We expect programming expenses to continue to increase due to a variety of factors,
including increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent and annual increases imposed by programmers
with increased selling power as a result of media consolidation. We have not been able to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a
potential loss of customers.

Revenue     

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $13.5 million, or 5%, as compared to revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as
follows:   

          Of
the $5.2 million, or 2%, increase in total Subscription Revenue, approximately $24.9 million was attributable to an increase in average revenue per unit ("ARPU") of our
customer base which is calculated as subscription revenue for each of the HSD, Video and Telephone services divided by the average total average revenue generating units ("RGUs") for each service
category for the respective period. Adding to this increase was approximately $1.1 million in revenue attributable to our Newnan, Georgia acquisition on September 9, 2016. Partially
offsetting these increases was a $20.8 million decrease attributable to a decline in RGUs as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

          The
increase in Other Commercial revenue of $3.7 million, or 59%, is primarily due to revenue generated by our construction activities in our wholesale commercial business. Due to
the nature of these contracts, we record this revenue as a pass-through with the corresponding offset in operating expenses. Additionally, we realized increases in our recurring revenue related to our
fiber network.   

          The
increase in Other revenue of $4.6 million, or 18%, is primarily due to increases in advertising revenue, reactivation fees and service protection fees.

increase in HSD subscription revenue is primarily attributable to a $2.5 million year over year increase in HSD ARPU, an increase of $1.8 million related to a year over year increase in
average HSD RGUs and an increase of $0.9 million in HSD subscription revenue related to our Newnan, Georgia acquisition.

subscription revenue increased $8.1 million, or 6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase is primarily attributable to a year over year increase of $23.8 million in Video ARPU and a $0.2 million increase in Video subscription revenue related to our Newnan, Georgia
acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases was a $15.9 million decrease in year over year video RGUs.   

          Phone
subscription revenue decreased $8.1 million, or 17%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease is primarily attributable to a $6.6 million decrease in year over year average phone RGU's and a decrease of $1.5 million in average year over year phone ARPU.   

Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)     

Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased $2.6 million, or 2%, in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased costs related to our network construction activities. Due to the
nature of these contracts we record this expense as a pass-through with the corresponding offset in other commercial revenue. Additionally we experienced increased employee related costs and costs
associated with our Newnan, Georgia acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased video programming costs and direct phone costs that correlate to the decreases in video and phone
RGU's and customer bad debt.   

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses     

SG A expenses increased $4.2 million, or 15%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to increases in our sales and marketing efforts and employee related costs, as well as
overall costs related to our Newnan, Georgia acquisition.   

Depreciation and amortization expenses     

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $6.3 million, or 11%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is related to an increase in retirements of fully depreciated assets in the first quarter 2016.   

Management fee to related party expense     

We pay a quarterly management fee of approximately $0.4 million per quarter plus any travel and miscellaneous expenses to Avista and
Crestview (the majority voting unit holders of Racecar Holdings, LLC, ultimate parent of WOW).   

Interest expense     

Interest expense decreased $2.4 million or 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted from lower outstanding debt and lower interest rates in connection with the refinancing of our term B loans and principal payment of
$150.0 million made in May 2015. In addition, in July 2016, we also paid $69.7 million in principal on our Senior Subordinated debt.

Loss on extinguishment of debt     

In connection with our August 19, 2016, Sixth Amendment refinancing of our Term B loans and the July 15, 2016 and
September 15, 2016 principal payments on our Senior Subordinated Notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.1 million which consists of the expensing of unamortized
deferred financing related to the Term B Loans and early prepayment penalties during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

Realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments, net     

Realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments was $0.0 and $1.2 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015, respectively. We do not use hedge accounting for financial reporting purpose so the adjustments to fair value of our interest rate swaps and caps are recorded to
earnings. Our interest rate swap expired on July 1, 2016.   

Other income (expense)     

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold our investment in Tower Cloud and recorded a gain on the sale of
$2.0 million.   

Income taxes benefit (expense)     

As a result of our restructuring where we became wholly owned by WideOpenWest Kite, Inc., we recorded total income tax benefit of
$5.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We do not anticipate that the restructuring will have any significant impact on future operating cash flows as our Parent
and its subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that would significantly reduce any required prospective tax payments   

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30,

Revenue     

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $5.2 million, or 1%, as compared to revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as follows:   

          Of
the $15.4 million, or 2%, decrease in total Subscription Revenue, approximately $79.8 million was attributable to a decrease RGUs as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $63.3 million increase in ARPU of our customer base which is calculated as subscription revenue for each of the HSD, video
and telephone services divided by the average total average RGUs for each service category for the respective period. Additionally, we had an overall increase in subscription revenue of
$1.1 million attributable to our Newnan, Georgia acquisition.   

  34  

Table of Contents   

          The
increase in Other Commercial revenue of $13.7 million, or 76%, is primarily due to revenue generated by our network construction activities. Due to the nature of these
contracts, we record this revenue as a pass-through with the corresponding offset in operating expenses. Additionally, we realized increases in our recurring revenue related to our fiber network.   

          The
increase in Other revenue of $6.9 million, or 9%, is primarily due to increases in advertising revenue and increases service call revenue.

HSD
subscription revenue increased $14.3 million, or 5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in HSD subscription revenue is primarily attributable to a $13.3 million year over year increase in HSD ARPU, an increase of $0.1 million related to a year over year increase in
average HSD RGUs and increase of $0.9 million related to our Newnan, Georgia acquisition.   

Video
subscription revenue decreased $3.9 million, or 1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease is primarily attributable to a year over year decrease of $56.7 million in average video RGUs. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $52.6 million increase in average year
over year video ARPU and $0.2 million increase in Video subscription revenue related to our Newnan Georgia acquisition.   

          Phone
subscription revenue decreased $25.8 million, or 18%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease is attributable to a $23.1 million decrease in year over year average phone RGUs and a decrease of $2.7 million in average year over year phone ARPU.   

Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)     

Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased $14.0 million, or 3%, in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases are primarily due to decreased video programing costs and direct phone costs that correlate to
the decreases in video and phone RGU's. In addition, we experienced a decrease in our customer bad debt expense. Partially offsetting the decreases were increases related to our construction
activities. Due to the nature of these contracts, we record this expense as a pass-through with the corresponding offset in other commercial revenue.   

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses     

SG A expenses increased $3.0 million, or 4%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $11.2 million, or 7%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to

to the same period ended 2015.   

Management fee to related party expense     

We pay a quarterly management fee of approximately $0.4 million per quarter plus any travel and miscellaneous expenses to Avista Capital

$150.0 million made in May 2015.   

Loss on extinguishment of debt     

In connection with our Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment to our Credit Agreement related to the refinancing of our Term B loans we recorded a
loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing the expensing of third party arranger fees and write off of unamortized
deferred financing costs. Additionally, on September 15, 2016 and July 15, 2016, we made principal payments on our Senior Subordinated Notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt
in the amount of $13.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing early prepayment penalties.   

          In
connection with our May 21, 2015 Third Amendment refinancing of our Term B loans, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt representing the expensing of prior deferred
financing costs of $22.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net     

Realized and unrealized gain on derivative instruments was $2.3 million and $4.3 million, for the nine months ended

Liquidity and Capital Resources     

          At September 30, 2016, we had $137.6 million in current assets, including $36.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and
$227.6 million in current liabilities. Our outstanding consolidated debt and capital lease obligations aggregated $2,953.1 million, of which $22.9 million is classified as current
in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.   

          On
December 18, 2015, funds managed by Crestview, a private equity firm based in New York, and Parent consummated a transaction whereby Crestview Partners
III GP, L.P. became the beneficial owner of approximately 35% of Parent. Under terms of the agreement (the "Crestview Purchase Agreement"), Crestview's funds purchased units held by
Avista and other unitholders, and made a $125 million primary investment in newly-issued units. Crestview has extensive experience in the telecommunications and we believe this investment will
help us capitalize on future growth opportunities.   

          On
April 29, 2016, funds managed by Avista and Crestview made an additional $40.0 million investment in newly-issued membership units in our Parent.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, $50.0 million of proceeds from these transactions have been contributed down to us while the remaining $93.2 million, net of accrued and
paid transaction expenses, have been recorded to our Parent's balance sheet and have not been pushed down and reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had borrowing capacity of $192.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and were in compliance with all our debt covenants. Accordingly,
we believe that we have sufficient resources to fund our obligations and anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.   

          On
July 15, 2016, we utilized existing cash balances and working capital funds to make a total $69.7 million payment towards the 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. Such
payment included a partial redemption totaling $46.9 million of the outstanding principal balance of the notes, call premium of $3.1 million, the payment of accrued interest on the notes
of $19.7 million and $0.9 million in expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the redemption.   

On
September 15, 2016, we redeemed an additional $159.1 million in principal amount outstanding of our 13.38% Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition to the principal
redemption, we paid $10.7 million in call premium, $3.5 million in accrued interest and $2.9 million in expensing of unamortized debt
issuance costs in connection with the redemption. Following the redemption, $89.0 million in principal amount remains outstanding under the Notes.   

Historical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities      

Operating Activities     

          Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $13.7 million from $124.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $110.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and is due to increases in operating assets and liabilities and cash income taxes paid during
2016, partially offset by increases in operating earnings.   

Investing Activities     

          Net cash used in investing activities increased $69.9 million from $174.8 million cash used for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $244.7 million cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to our asset purchase of Newnan, Georgia of
$54.3 million. Capital expenditures were $207.2 million and $174.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The
increase in capital expenditures is   

  37  

Table of Contents   

  primarily
due to our build out of our fiber network in our Midwest region. Partially offsetting these cash uses was a one-time sale of our investment in Tower Cloud of $15.7 million.   

          Capital
expenditures will continue to be driven primarily by customer demand for our services. In the event we have higher-than-expected customer demand for our services, while resulting
in higher revenue and income from operations, such increased demand may also increase our projected capital expenditures.   

Financing Activities     

          Net cash from financing activities improved $275.4 million from $171.7 million cash used for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $103.7 million cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due
to the additional $240 million proceeds from the refinancing of our Term B loans plus a contribution from our Parent of $50.0 million. Adding to this increase was a pay down of
$150.0 million on our Term B-1 loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Partially offsetting these increases were additional payments and redemptions of approximately
$206.0 million on our Senior Subordinated Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.            

          Our exposure to market risk is limited and primarily related to fluctuating interest rates associated with our variable rate indebtedness under
our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, borrowings under our Term B Loans and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an adjusted
LIBOR rate (which is subject to a minimum rate of 1.00% for Term B Loans) or an ABR (which is subject to a minimum rate of 2.00%). The applicable margins for the Term B Loans may change
depending on the Company's leverage ratio, from a minimum of 3.50% up to a maximum of 4.00% for adjusted LIBOR loans or a minimum of 2.50% up to a maximum of 3.00% for ABR loans. The applicable margin
for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is 3.50% for adjusted LIBOR loans and 2.50% for ABR loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point (1%) change in LIBOR interest rates (based on the interest
rates in effect under our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016) would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately $20.7 million on our Senior
Secured Credit Facility.    

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures            

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      

          As of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the information generated for
use in this quarterly report. The evaluation was based in part upon reports and certifications provided by a number of executives. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.   

          In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible   

  38  

Table of Contents   

  controls
and procedures. Based upon the above evaluation, we believe that our controls provide such reasonable assurances.   

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      

          There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   

  39  

Table of Contents    

      PART II     

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings            

          The Company is party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class actions) arising in the normal course of its
business covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of access, programming, taxes, fees and surcharges, consumer
protection, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers.   

In
accordance with GAAP, WOW accrues an expense for pending litigation when it determines an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal
defense costs are expensed as incurred. None of the Company's existing accruals for pending matters is material. WOW regularly monitors its pending litigation for the purpose of adjusting its accruals
and revising its disclosures accordingly, in accordance with GAAP, when required. Litigation is, however, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. The
Company vigorously defends its interest in pending litigation, and as of this date, WOW believes the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities
to which it is entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or our cash flows.    

      Item 1A.    Risk Factors     

          There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17,
2016.    

      Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Proceeds and Use of Proceeds.     

None.    

      Item 3.    Defaults Upon Senior Securities     

          None.    

      Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures     

          Not applicable.

Such Term Loans (i) shall be made on the Closing Date, (ii) may, at the option of the Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, ABR Loans or LIBOR Term Loans;  provided  that all such Term Loans made by each of the Lenders pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, consist entirely of Term Loans of the same Type, (iii) may be repaid or prepaid in accordance with the provisions hereof, but once repaid or prepaid, may not be reborrowed, and (iv) shall not exceed in the aggregate the total of all Term Loan Commitments. On the Term Loan Maturity Date, all Original Term Loans shall be repaid in full. All Other Term Loans shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date set forth in the applicable Incremental Amendment, Refinancing Amendment or Loan Modification Agreement. 
     
  (b)                                    (i) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment severally agrees to make a Revolving Credit Loan or Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower, which Revolving Credit Loans (A) (1) that are Non-Extended Revolving Credit Loans shall be made by such Lender with Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date and prior to the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (2) that are Fourth Amendment Revolving Credit Loans shall be made by such Lender with Fourth Amendment Revolving Credit Commitments at any time and from time to time on or after the Fourth Amendment Effective Date and prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date;  provided  that Revolving Credit Loans may be made on the Closing Date in an amount not to exceed $48,000,000, (B) may, at the option of the Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, ABR Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans;  provided  that all Revolving Credit Loans made by each of the Lenders pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, consist entirely of Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type, (C) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance

  (ii)                                     Each Lender may, at its option, make any LIBOR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;  provided  that (A) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan and (B) in exercising such option, such Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to minimize any increased costs to the Borrower resulting therefrom (which obligation of the Lender shall not require it to take, or refrain from taking, actions that it determines would result in increased costs for which it will not be compensated hereunder or that it determines would be otherwise disadvantageous to it and in the event of such request for costs for which compensation is provided under this Agreement, the provisions of Section 3.5 shall apply). On the First Amendment Effective Date, all Original Revolving Credit Loans were repaid in full. On the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding shall be repaid in full (it being understood that any such Non-Extended Revolving Credit Loans may, at the Borrower s option, be repaid with the proceeds of Fourth Amendment Extended Revolving Credit Loans made on the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date, subject to the terms and conditions applicable to Fourth Amendment Extended Revolving Credit Loans). On the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, all Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding shall be repaid in full, except to the extent set forth in any applicable Incremental Amendment, Refinancing Amendment or Loan Modification Agreement with respect to any Other Revolving Credit Loans. 
     
  (iii)                                  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein, for so long as any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments has an earlier Maturity Date than any other Class of Revolving Credit Commitments (such Class with the earliest occurring Maturity Date being referred to as the   Earliest Maturing Revolving Class  ), (w) each Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata across all such Classes (based on the aggregate unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to each such Class) (but excluding any Earliest Maturing Revolving Class with respect to Borrowings to be made on the Maturity Date of such Class or the date the Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to such Class are terminated so long as all Revolving Credit Commitments and all Revolving Credit Loans under such Class have been terminated and repaid concurrently with or prior to such Borrowing), (x) each payment or prepayment (whether pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2 or otherwise) of Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata across all such Classes (based on the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding with respect to each such Class), (y) any termination or reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made pro rata across all such Classes (based on the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to each such Class), and (z) subject to the last sentence of Section 3.3(a), all L/C Participations shall be pro rata across all such Classes (based on the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to each such Class); provided that, in the case of any prepayment or repayment of Revolving Credit Loans under the Earliest Maturing Revolving Class or termination or reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments under such Class either on (A) the Maturity Date for such Class or (B) an earlier date, solely to the extent the Revolving Credit Loans under such Class are being repaid in full on such date and all Revolving Credit Commitments under such Class have been terminated on or prior to such date, any such prepayment, repayment, reduction or termination shall be applied (or, in the case of any voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or voluntary reduction pursuant to Section 4.2, at the Borrower s option, may be applied) first  
     
 58   

to the Revolving Credit Loans under such Class until paid in full and to the Revolving Credit Commitments under such Class until terminated in full, as applicable, unless immediately after giving effect thereto the Aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings would exceed 100% of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment as then in effect.  
     
  2.2                                   Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings . The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing of Term Loans shall be in a multiple of $1,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans shall be in a multiple of $1,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and, in each case, shall not be less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount with respect thereto. More than one Borrowing may be incurred on any date;  provided  that at no time shall there be outstanding more than 12 Borrowings of LIBOR Loans under this Agreement. 
     
  2.3                                   Notice of Borrowing . (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Office (i) prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days  prior written notice (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent is willing to accommodate from time to time) (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the Borrowing of Term Loans if all or any of such Term Loans are to be initially LIBOR Loans, and (ii) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of the Borrowing of Term Loans if all such Term Loans are to be ABR Loans. Such notice (together with each notice of a Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.3(b), a   Notice of Borrowing  ) shall be irrevocable, shall be substantially in the form of  Exhibit D  or any other form approved by the Administrative Agent, and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be the Closing Date) and (iii) whether the Term Loans shall consist of ABR Loans and/or LIBOR Term Loans and, if the Term Loans are to include LIBOR Term Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender notice of the proposed Borrowing of Term Loans, of such Lender s proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the related Notice of Borrowing. 
     
  (b)                                    Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Revolving Credit Loans hereunder (other than Borrowings to repay Unpaid Drawings), it shall give the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Office, prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) (i) at least three Business Days  prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, and (ii) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of the Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans if all such Revolving Credit Loans are to be ABR Loans. Each such Notice of Borrowing, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 2.10, shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the respective Borrowing shall consist of ABR Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans and, if LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto, and (iv) remittance instructions. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each applicable Lender notice of each proposed Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans, of such Lender s proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the related Notice of Borrowing. 
     
  (c)                                     Borrowings to reimburse Unpaid Drawings shall be made upon the notice specified in Section 3.4(a). 
     
  (d)                                    Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the 
     
 59   

Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower. In each such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent s record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.  
     
  2.4           Disbursement of Funds . (a) No later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its  pro rata  portion, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below.  
     
  (b)           Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund to the Borrower under any Borrowing in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Office and the Administrative Agent will (except in the case of Borrowings to repay Unpaid Drawings) make available to the Borrower, by depositing to the Borrower s account (as designated by it in a written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time) the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the proposed date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the Borrower, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Loans, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.  
     
  (c)           Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder).  
     
  2.5           Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt . (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars, for the benefit of the Lenders, on the Term Loan Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Term Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars, for the benefit of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Lenders, on the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Non-Extended Revolving Credit Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars, for the benefit of the applicable Revolving Credit Lenders, on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Revolving Credit Loans, except to the extent set forth in any applicable Incremental Amendment, Refinancing Amendment or Loan Modification Agreement with respect to any Other Revolving Credit Loans.  
     
  (b)           The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars, for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders, on (A) December 31, 2016 (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the  
     
 60   

immediately preceding Business Day) and the last Business Day of each subsequent calendar quarter ending after the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, the principal of the Term B Loans in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term B Loans on the Sixth Amendment Effective Date (after giving effect to the Loans made on such date) (as such payments are adjusted from time to time pursuant to Sections 2.17, 2.18, 2.19 or Section 5), and (B) on the Term B Loan Maturity Date, the unpaid outstanding balance of the Term B Loans, in each case, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment (each, a   Term Loan Repayment Amount  ).  
     
  (c)           Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.  
     
  (d)           The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 13.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type of each Loan made and, if applicable, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender s share thereof.  
     
  (e)           The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded;  provided ,  however , that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  
     
  (f)            Upon the request by any Lender, at any time and from time to time, the Borrower shall provide to such Lender, at the Borrower s own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of  Exhibit K-1  or  K-2 , as the case may be, evidencing the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans, respectively, owing to such Lender.  
     
  2.6           Conversions and Continuations . (a) The Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to convert all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans made to the Borrower (as applicable) of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type and the Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to continue the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans as LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may be, for an additional Interest Period;  provided  that (i) no partial conversion of LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount, (ii) ABR Loans may not be converted into LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (iii) LIBOR Loans may not be continued as LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed continuation and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation and (iv) Borrowings resulting from conversions pursuant to this Section  
     
 61   

2.6 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2. Each such conversion or continuation shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Office prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days  (or, in the case of a conversion into ABR Loans, prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such conversion) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) (or, in each case, such shorter period as may be permitted by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) (each a   Notice of Conversion or Continuation  ), specifying the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be so converted or continued, the Type of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be converted or continued into and, if such Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent    shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion or continuation affecting any of its Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans. 
     
  (b)           If any Default or Event of Default is in existence at the time of any proposed continuation of any LIBOR Loans, and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted on the last day of the then-current Interest Period into ABR Loans. If no Interest Period is specified in any Notice of Conversion or Continuation with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower has failed to deliver a Notice of Conversion or Continuation to continue or convert such Borrowing as provided in paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of LIBOR Loans into a Borrowing of ABR Loans, effective as of the expiration date of such then-current Interest Period.  
     
  2.7           Pro Rata Borrowings . Each Borrowing of Term B Loans (including Refinancing Term B Loans and New Term B Loans) under this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders  pro rata  on the basis of their then-applicable Term B Loan Commitments or New Term B Loan Commitments (as applicable) with respect to the applicable Class. Each Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders  pro rata  on the basis of their then-applicable Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to the applicable Class in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii) (it being understood that the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Fourth Amendment Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be drawn on a ratable basis, subject to Section 2.1(b)(iii), as if the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Fourth Amendment Extended Revolving Credit Commitments are one Class of Revolving Credit Commitments for this purpose). It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.  
     
  2.8           Interest . (a) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof to but excluding the date of repayment thereof at a rate  per annum  that shall at all times be the Applicable ABR Margin plus the ABR in effect from time to time.  
     
  (b)           The unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof to but excluding the date of repayment thereof at a rate  per annum  that shall at all times be the Applicable LIBOR Margin in effect from time to time plus the relevant Adjusted LIBO Rate.  
     
  (c)           Any amount (whether of principal, interest or Fees) not paid when due hereunder or under any other Credit Document (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by law (after as well as before judgment), payable on demand, (a) in  
     
 62   

the case of principal, at the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto  plus  2.00%  per annum , and (b) in all other cases, at a rate  per annum  equal to the rate that would be applicable to an ABR Loan that is a Term Loan (and, if there is more than one Class of Term Loans then outstanding, the highest such rate applicable to ABR Loans that are Term Loans)  plus  2.00%  per annum , in each case from and including the date of such non-payment to but excluding the date on which such amount is paid in full.  
     
   (d)           Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter of the Borrower, (ii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three-month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period and (iii) in respect of each Loan (except ABR Loans, other than in the case of prepayments which    constitute prepayments in full of all Loans), on any prepayment (on the amount prepaid), on conversion into an ABR Loan, at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand. 
     
  (e)           All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 5.5.  
     
  (f)            The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.  
     
  (g)           If on any day a Loan is outstanding with respect to which a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation has not been delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day such Loan shall be an ABR Loan.  
     
  2.9           Interest Periods . At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans (in the case of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower shall have the right to elect by giving the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower be a one, two, three, six or (if agreed to by all the Lenders making such loans) a nine or twelve month period;  provided  that the initial Interest Period may be for a period less than one month if agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:  
     
  (a)           the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing of ABR Loans) and shall end on the numerically corresponding day in the calendar month that is one, two, three, six (or, if applicable as provided above) nine or twelve months thereafter, and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;  
     
  (b)           if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;  
     
 63   

(c)           if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day;  provided  that if any Interest Period in respect of a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;  
     
  (d)           the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in respect of any LIBOR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the applicable Maturity Date of such Loan; and  
     
  (e)           in the event the Borrower fails to specify an Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.  
     
  2.10         Inability to Determine Interest Rate, Illegality, etc . (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):  
     
  (i)            on any date for determining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any Interest Period that (x) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such LIBOR Borrowing are not generally available in the relevant market or (y) by reason of any changes arising on or after the Closing Date affecting the interbank LIBOR market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted LIBO Rate; or  
     
  (ii)           at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any LIBOR Loans (other than any such increase or reduction attributable to Taxes) because of (x) any change since the date hereof in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order), such as, for example, without limitation, a change in official reserve requirements, and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market or the position of such Lender in such market; or  
     
  (iii)          at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof that materially and adversely affects the interbank LIBOR market.  
     
  then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice (if by telephone, confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter, (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Term Loans and LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice the Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no longer exist), and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the Borrower with respect to LIBOR Term Loans or LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, promptly after receipt of written demand therefor such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating,

interest or otherwise as such Lender in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.  
     
   (b)           At any time that any LIBOR Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a LIBOR Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel    said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days  notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such LIBOR Revolving Credit Loan and LIBOR Term Loan into an ABR Loan;  provided  that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated in the same manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b). 
     
  2.11         Increased Costs .  
     
  (a)            Increased Costs Generally .  
     
  (i)            If any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of participating in or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Letter of Credit Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  
     
  (ii)           If any Change in Law shall subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Letter of Credit Issuer or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Letter of Credit Issuer or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Letter of Credit Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Letter of Credit Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or  
     
 65   

amounts as will compensate such Lender, Letter of Credit Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  
     
   (b)            Capital Requirements . If any Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by any Letter of Credit Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s holding    company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer or such Lender s or Letter of Credit Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. Each Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.14, release or diminish any of the Borrower s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) upon receipt of such notice. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such notice within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
     
  (c)           It is understood that, to the extent duplicative of Section 5.4, this Section 2.11 shall not apply to Taxes.  
     
  2.12         Compensation . If (a) any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is made by the Borrower (or, with respect to Section 13.7, is purchased by a replacement bank or institution), as the case may be, to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7, as a result of any action or assignment pursuant to Section 2.13, as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, (b) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans is not made as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted into a LIBOR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (d) any LIBOR Loan is not continued as a LIBOR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (e) any prepayment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.  
     
  2.13         Change of Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), 2.11 or 3.5, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.4, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to  
     
 66   

assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 3.5 or 5.4.  
     
  2.14         Notice of Certain Costs . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Lender that gives any notice required by Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 3.5 or 5.4 shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 181  st  day prior to the giving of such notice to the Borrower, as the case may be (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 181-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
     
  2.15         Defaulting Lenders .  
     
  (a)            Defaulting Lender Adjustments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:  
     
  (i)            Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of  Required Lenders .  
     
  (ii)           Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 11 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 13.8(a) shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:  first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;  second , to the payment on a  pro rata  basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder;  third , to cash collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuers  Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.16;  fourth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;  fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released  pro rata  in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuers  future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.16;  sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;  seventh , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;  provided  that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Unpaid Drawing in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its  
     
 67   

appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or such Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 7 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Unpaid Drawings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a  pro rata  basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Unpaid Drawings owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and Letter of Credit Exposure are held by the Lenders  pro rata  in accordance with the applicable Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iii). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral in accordance with Section 2.16 that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  
     
   (iii)          All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 7 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and,    unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment. Subject to  Section 13.19 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. If the reallocation described in this clause (iii) cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuers  Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16. 
     
  (iv)          Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Letter of Credit Exposure for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.16. With respect to any Letter of Credit Fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this clause (iv), the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s Letter of Credit Exposure that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iii) above, (y) pay to each Letter of Credit Issuer, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Letter of Credit Issuer s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  
     
  (b)            Defaulting Lender Cure . If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Letter of Credit Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held  pro rata  by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iii)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;  provided  that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and  provided ,  further , that except to the extent  
     
 68   

otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.  
     
  (c)            New Letters of Credit . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.  
     
  2.16         Cash Collateral . At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Letter of Credit Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Issuers  Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iii) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.  
     
   (a)            Grant of Security Interest . The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of    the Letter of Credit Issuers, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders  obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Exposure, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuers as herein provided (other than nonconsensual Liens permitted by Section 10.2), or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
     
  (b)            Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.16 or Section 2.15 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Exposure (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.  
     
  (c)            Termination of Requirement . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Letter of Credit Issuer s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and each Letter of Credit Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;  provided  that, subject to Section 2.15 the Person providing Cash Collateral and each Letter of Credit Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and;  provided ,  further , that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Credit Documents.  
     
  2.17         Incremental Commitments . (a) The Borrower may, from time to time after the Closing Date, by written notice to the Administrative Agent request the establishment of (i) one or more new term loan commitments (the   New Term Loan Commitments  ), (ii) one or more additional tranches of revolving credit commitments (the   Additional Revolving Credit Commitments  ) and/or (iii) one or more increases in the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments (each such increase, a   Revolving Credit Commitment Increase   and, together with the New Term Loan Commitments and the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments, the   Incremental Commitments  ), in an aggregate amount for all such  
     
 69   

Incremental Commitments established following the First Amendment Effective Date not in excess of the Incremental Facility Amount. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an   Increased Amount Date  ) on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Commitments shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten Business Days (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent) after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent. The Borrower may seek Incremental Commitments from existing Lenders or from by any other bank, financial institution, other institutional lender or other Person that is an eligible assignee pursuant to Section 13.6(b) (any such other Person being called an   Additional Lender    provided , that the Administrative Agent (and, solely with respect to any Additional Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Revolving Credit Commitment Increase, each Letter of Credit Issuer) shall have consented to such Additional Lender s providing any Incremental Commitments to the extent such consent would be required under Section 13.6(b) for an assignment of Loans or Commitments, as applicable, to such Additional Lender;  provided ,  further , that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide an Incremental Commitment.  
     
  (b)           Such Incremental Commitment shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date;  provided  that (1) the representations and warranties set forth herein and in the other Credit Documentation shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such Increased Amount Date as if made on and as of such date (except where such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date);  provided  that, with respect to any Incremental Commitments the proceeds of which are used to fund a Permitted Acquisition substantially concurrently upon the receipt thereof, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing the applicable Incremental Commitment, the only representations and warranties the making of which shall be a condition to the making of such Incremental Commitments shall be the representations and warranties set forth in clause (b) of the definition of Closing Date Representations and the representations and warranties contained in the purchase agreement relating to such Permitted Acquisition as are material to the interests of the Lenders but only to the extent that the Borrower or any of its Affiliates have the right to terminate its or their obligations under such purchase agreement as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties in such purchase agreement); (2) the Incremental Commitments (and the Loans made pursuant thereto) shall be secured on a  pari passu  basis with the Term B Loans, the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Revolving Credit Loans and shall be secured only by the Collateral securing the Obligations; (3) no Parent Guarantor nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall guarantee the Incremental Commitments or Loans made pursuant thereto unless such Parent Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor on the Increased Amount Date); (4) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date immediately prior to or after giving effect to such Incremental Commitments and to the making of any Loans pursuant thereto;  provided  that, with respect to any Incremental Commitments the proceeds of which are used to fund a Permitted Acquisition substantially concurrently upon the receipt thereof, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing the applicable Incremental Commitment, the absence of a Default or Event of Default shall not constitute a condition to the making of such Incremental Commitments; (5) the Incremental Commitments and related Loans made pursuant thereto shall be effected pursuant to one or more amendments (each, an   Incremental Amendment  ) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Credit Documents, executed by the Parent Guarantors, the Borrower, each Lender and each Additional Lender providing such New Term Loan Commitments, Additional Revolving Credit Commitments or Revolving Credit Commitment Increase, as applicable (each of which shall be recorded in the Register and shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 5.4(d)), and the Administrative Agent; and (6) the Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to Section 2.12 in connection with the Incremental Commitments, as applicable.  Any New Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date that have terms and provisions that differ from Term Loans outstanding on the date on which such New Term Loans are made shall be designated as a separate Class of Term Loans for  
     
 70   

all purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that each Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.17.  
     
   (c)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, (i) the Maturity Date of any New Term Loans shall not be earlier than the then-existing Latest Maturity Date with respect to any Existing Class of Term Loans, (ii) any New Term Loans shall not have a shorter Weighted Average Life than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any then-outstanding Term Loans, (iii) if the Initial Yield on any New Term Loans exceeds the Initial Yield then in effect for any such Existing Class (or Classes) of Term Loans by more than 50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the   Yield Differential  ), then the Applicable ABR Margin and the Applicable LIBO Margin then in effect for such Class of Term Loans shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the making of the New Term Loans and (iv) any New Term Loans shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions of the Term Loans then in effect or such other terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. On any Increased Amount Date on    which any New Term Loan Commitments of any Class are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each Lender with a New Term Loan Commitment (each, a   New Term Loan Lender  ) of any Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a   New Term Loan  ) in an amount equal to its New Term Loan Commitment of such Class, and (ii) each New Term Loan Lender of any Class shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New Term Loan Commitment of such Class and the New Term Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto. 
     
  (d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, (A) any Revolving Credit Commitment Increase shall be on the exact same terms (including with respect to commitment reductions and interest rates) as the Fourth Amendment Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, except for such differences (including with respect to maturity date) that are expressly permitted by the following subclause (B), and (B) (i) the Maturity Date of any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments shall not be earlier than, and shall not require mandatory commitment reduction (except ratably with the Revolving Credit Commitments) prior to, the then-existing Latest Maturity Date with respect to the latest maturing Existing Class of Revolving Credit Loans, (ii) if the Initial Yield on any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments (and related Revolving Credit Loans) that expire on or before the one-year anniversary of the Latest Maturity Date with respect to the latest maturing Existing Class (or Classes) of Revolving Credit Commitments (and, in each case, any related Revolving Credit Loans) (such expiration of Additional Revolving Credit Commitments determined without giving effect to contingencies that would cause such expiration to be earlier than otherwise stated unless and until such contingency occurs), exceeds the Initial Yield then in effect for any such Existing Class (or Classes) of Revolving Credit Commitments (and related Revolving Credit Loans) by more than 50 basis points, then the Applicable ABR Margin and the Applicable LIBO Margin then in effect for such Existing Class (or Classes) of Revolving Credit Commitments (and related Revolving Credit Loans) shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the effectiveness of such Additional Revolving Credit Commitments, (iii) the borrowing and repayment (other than in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments) of the Revolving Credit Loans under any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a  pro rata  basis with any borrowings and repayments of the Revolving Credit Loans then in effect (the mechanics for which may be implemented through the applicable Incremental Amendment and may include technical changes related to the borrowing and repayment procedures of the Revolving Credit Loans then in effect) and (iv) any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect or such other terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, including, for the avoidance of doubt any  MFN  protection applicable to such Additional Revolving Credit Commitments.  
     
 71   

(e)           Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld), take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all New Term Loans that, pursuant to the applicable Incremental Amendment, are to be of the same Class of an Existing Class of Term Loans, when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of such Existing Class of Term Loans on a  pro rata  basis. This may be accomplished by requiring each outstanding Borrowing of LIBOR Term Loans to be converted into a Borrowing of Term Loans that are ABR Loans on the date the applicable New Term Loan is made, or by allocating a portion of each such New Term Loan to each outstanding Borrowing of LIBOR Term Loans on a  pro rata  basis. Any conversion of Borrowing of LIBOR Term Loans to Term Loans that are ABR Loans required by the preceding sentence shall be subject to Section 2.12. If any New Term Loan is to be allocated to an existing Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Term Loans, then the interest rate thereon for such Interest Period and the other economic consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental Amendment. In addition, (i) to the extent any New Term Loans are not Other Term Loans, the scheduled amortization payments under Section 2.5(b) required to be made after the making of such New Term Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such New Term Loans and shall be further increased    for all Lenders on a  pro rata  basis to the extent necessary to avoid any reduction in the amortization payments to which the Term Lenders were entitled before such recalculation. 
     
  (f)            Upon each Revolving Credit Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section, each Revolving Credit Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each Lender providing a portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment Increase (each a   Revolving Credit Commitment Increase Lender  ) in respect of such increase, and each such Revolving Credit Commitment Increase Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Revolving Credit Lender s participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit such that, after giving effect to each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding participations hereunder in Letters of Credit held by each Revolving Credit Lender (including each such Revolving Credit Commitment Increase Lender) will equal the percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all Revolving Credit Lenders represented by such Revolving Credit Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment and (b) if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding, such Revolving Credit Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Revolving Credit Commitment Increase be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Revolving Credit Loans made hereunder (reflecting such increase in Revolving Credit Commitments), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Credit Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with Section 2.12. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing,  pro rata  borrowing and  pro rata  payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.  
     
  This Section 2.17 shall supersede any provisions in Section 5.2, 13.1 or 13.8(a) to the contrary.

After any resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer s resignation or replacement as a Letter of Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to such Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (a) while it was a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement or (b) at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer.

 86   

Loans that are ABR Loans to the full extent thereof before application to Term Loans that are LIBOR Loans in a manner that minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12.  
     
  (e)            Application to Revolving Credit Loans . With respect to each prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans required or elected by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.2(a) or required by Section 5.2(b) and subject to Section 2.1(b)(iii), the Borrower may designate (i) the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made and (ii) the Revolving Credit Loans to be prepaid;  provided  that (w) LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans may be designated for prepayment pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto unless all LIBOR Loans with Interest Periods ending on such date of required prepayment and all ABR Loans have been paid in full; (x) if any prepayment by the Borrower of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans, such Borrowing shall immediately be converted into ABR Loans; and (y) each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied  pro rata  among such Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.12.

In lieu of making any payment pursuant to this Section 5.2 in respect of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may deposit with the    Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid and such LIBOR Loan shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account established on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, earning interest at the then-customary rate for accounts of such type. Such deposit shall constitute cash collateral for the Obligations;  provided  that the Borrower may at any time direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable payment required pursuant to this Section 5.2. 
     
  (g)            Minimum Amount . No prepayment shall be required pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i) with respect to Asset Sale Prepayment Events, Casualty Events and Permitted Sale Leasebacks unless and until the amount at any time of Net Cash Proceeds from such Prepayment Events required to be applied at or prior to such time pursuant to such Section and not yet applied at or prior to such time to prepay Term Loans pursuant to such Section exceeds $7,500,000 in the aggregate for all such Prepayment Events.

Section 5.2 and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Asset Sale or a portion of Excess Cash Flow attributable to Restricted Foreign Subsidiaries would have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary;  provided  that, in the case of this clause (ii), on or before the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds from any Foreign Asset Sale so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to reinvestments or prepayments pursuant to Section 5.2(a) (or, in the case of Excess Cash Flow, a date on or before the date that is twelve months after the date such Excess Cash Flow would have so required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(ii) unless previously repatriated in which case such repatriated Excess Cash Flow shall have been promptly applied to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 5.2(a) as if such funds had been received as Excess Cash Flow by the Borrower (and constituted Excess Cash Flow of the Borrower) in the prior fiscal year), (x) the Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Restricted Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary.  
     
   5.3           Method and Place of Payment . (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto or the Letter of Credit Issuer not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due and    shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent s Office. All payments under each Credit Document (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) shall be made in Dollars. The Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day (if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent, prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such day) like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or Fees ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto. 
     
  (b)           Any payments by the Borrower under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.  
     
  (c)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  
     
 88   

5.4           Taxes . (a) All payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If any such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the Borrower shall increase the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Indemnified Taxes (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts it would have received had no deductions or withholding been made. Whenever any Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.4 as promptly as possible thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent and to such Lender, acting reasonably) received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Indemnified Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest, costs or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 5.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
     
  (b)            Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.  
     
  (c)            Indemnification by the Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
     
  (d)           Each Non-US Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so:  
     
  (i)            deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies on or prior to the date on which such person becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of either (x) in the case of a Non-US Lender claiming exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of  portfolio interest , United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form) (together with a certificate substantially in the form of  Exhibit I  representing that such Non-US Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code)) (a   U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate  ), or (y) United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form), in each  
     
 89   

case properly completed (including, in the case or Form W-8IMY, the attachment of the properly completed and executed, United States Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8 and W-9 that support such form, to the extent required by applicable law) and duly executed by such Non-US Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement;  
     
  (ii)           deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and  
     
  (iii)          obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent;  
     
   unless, in any such case, any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Lender from duly compiling and delivering any such form with respect to it, and such Lender so advises the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 13.6 or a Lender pursuant to Section 13.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to Section 5.4(d) and (e);  provided  that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased. Each other Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this    Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) an United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. 
     
  (e)           If a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA and any regulations promulgated thereunder after the date of this Agreement.  
     
  (f)            If any Lender or the Administrative Agent determines in good faith that it has received a refund of a tax for which a payment has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender, or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount, net of all out-of-pocket expense (together with any interest received from the relevant Governmental Authority thereon) as the Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. The Borrower, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall repay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (e) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such  
     
 90   

refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Lender or the Administrative Agent be obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower (or any information it deems confidential to any person) in connection with this paragraph (f) or any other provision of this Section 5.4.  
     
  5.5           Computations of Interest and Fees . (a) Interest on LIBOR Loans and, except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, ABR Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest on (i) ABR Loans in respect of which the rate of interest is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate and (ii) interest on overdue interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.  
     
  (b)           All Fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360- day year for the actual days elapsed.  
     
  5.6           Limit on Rate of Interest .

  (b)            Payment at Highest Lawful Rate . If the Borrower is not obliged to make a payment which it would otherwise be required to make as a result of Section 5.6(a), the Borrower shall make such payment to the maximum extent permitted by or consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations.  
     
  (c)            Adjustment if any Payment exceeds Lawful Rate . If any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid by the Borrower to the affected Lender under Section 2.8.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have received from the Borrower an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent, to obtain reimbursement from such Lender in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by that Lender to the Borrower. Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Section 5.6(c) shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that any Loan remains outstanding.

  (i)                                        the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 13.6;

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to  
     
 146   

a Non-Consenting Lender that has not consented to a matter which requires the consent of all Lenders of a particular Class, such assignment (and related payments) may be made, at the election of the Borrower, solely with respect to Loans and Commitments of such Class. In the event any such Lender fails to execute an Assignment and Acceptance in connection with such assignment, such Assignment and Acceptance may be executed by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the assigning Lender) and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent are granted a power of attorney to execute such an Assignment and Acceptance in the circumstances provided for in this Section 13.7.
