As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned casino operations in North America; held a majority ownership interest in   eight   casinos throughout Poland, a racetrack and entertainment center ( REC ) in Canada and the pari-mutuel off-track betting network in southern Alberta, Canada; managed cruise ship-based casinos on international waters; managed a casino in Aruba and provide  d   gaming services in Argentina.  

The Company   currently   owns, operates and manages the following casinos through wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America:

The Century Casino Calgary, Alberta, Canada ( CAL )     

The Century Casino St. Albert in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada   See note 3 for information related to the Company s recent acquisition of Apex Casino, which now operates as Century Casino St. Albert ( CSA ).     

The Century Casino   Hotel in Central City, Colorado   ( CTL )  ; and     

The Century Casino   Hotel in Cripple Creek   ( CRC )  , Colorado     

The Company currently has a controlling financial interest through its subsidiary Century Casinos Europe GmbH ( CCE ) in the following majority-owned subsidiaries: 

T  he Company   owns   66.6%   of Casinos Poland Ltd ( CPL  or  Casinos Poland ). CPL is the owner and operator of   eight   casinos throughout Poland. CPL is consolidated as a majority-owned subsidiary for which the Company has a controlling financial interest. Polish Airports Company ( Polish Airports ) owns the remaining   33.3%   of CPL, which is reported as a non-controlling financial interest.      

The Company   owns   75%   of United Horsemen of Alberta Inc. dba Century Downs Racetrack and Casino ( CDR  or  Century Downs ). CDR operates Century Downs Racetrack and Casino, a REC in Balzac, a north metropolitan area of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. CDR is consolidated as a majority-owned subsidiary for which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The remaining   25%   of CDR is owned by unaffiliated shareholders and is reported as a non-controlling financial interest. The casino at CDR opened in April 2015  .     T  he 201  6   horse racing season is from   February   to November.     

On March 20, 2015, CCE converted CAD   11  .0   million that it had loaned to CDR into an additional   60%   ownership interest in CDR. As a result of the conversion, the Company recognized   $0.6   million in additional paid-in capital and   $0.1   million in accumulated other comprehensive income that was previously attributed to non-controlling interest. 

The Company   owns   75%   of Century Bets! Inc. ( CBS  or  Century Bets )  .   CBS is consolidated as a majority-owned subsidiary for which the Company has a controlling financial interest. Rocky Mountain Turf Club ( RMTC ) owns the remaining   25%   of CBS, which is reported as a non-controlling financial interest. CBS began operating the pari-mutuel off-track horse betting network in southern Alberta in May 2015.     

The Company has the following concession, management and consulting service agreements: 

The Company   operates   13   ship-based casinos   through concession agreements     with   four   cruise ship owners.     The Company began operating the ship-based casinos onboard the Mein Schiff 5, a new   2,500   passenger cruise ship, and TUI Discovery, a   2,067   passenger cruise ship, during the second quarter of 2016, and began operating the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea, a   1,200   passenger cruise ship that operates in the China market, in July 2016. Under an   amended concession agreement with TUI Cruises  , the Company also plans to operate the   ship-based casino onboard Mein   Schiff 6, a new     2,500   passenger cruise ship that   is   expected to begin operati  ng   in the   third   quarter of 2017.      

In   connection with     entering into a   concession agreement   with Diamond Cruise International Co., Ltd. ( Diamond ) for the operation of the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea  , the Company   also   entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Dynamic Partners International, Ltd. ( Dynamic ). Under this agreement, Dynamic markets and promotes the casino to VIP players along with facilitating the concession agreement between Diamond and the Company, for which the Company pays   Dynamic   a portion of   the   net profit from the casino   onboard Glory Sea  . 

10   

In March 2015, the Company mutually agreed with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ( Norwegian ) to terminate its concession agreements with Oceania Cruises ( Oceania ) and Regent Seven Seas Cruises ( Regent ), indirect subsidiaries of Norwegian, effective June 1, 2015 (the  Termination Agreement ). The Company transitioned operations of the   eight   ship-based casinos that it operated onboard Oceania and Regent vessels to Norwegian in the second quarter of 2015. As consideration for the early termination of the concession agreements, the Company received   $4.0   million in June 2015   and   recorded this on its condensed consolidated statement of earnings (loss) under operating   revenue net of     $0.6   million   related to   assets that were sold to Norwegian as part of the Termination Agreement.  

The Company also entered into a   two  -year consulting agreement, which became effective on June 1, 2015, under which the Company is providing limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of   $2.0   million, which is payable   $250,000   per quarter.  

The Company has a management agreement to direct the operation of the casino at the Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort       Casino from which the Company receives a monthly management fee.   The management agreement expires in 2017 and the Company does not anticipate signing a new agreement.     

The Company, through its subsidiary CCE, has a   7.5%     ownership interest in   Mendoza Central Entretenimientos S.A., an Argentina   company ( MCE )  . The shares are reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet using the cost method of accounting. MCE has an exclusive concession agreement with Instituto Provincial de Juegos y Casinos to lease slot machines and provide related services to Casino   de Mendoza  , a casino located in Mendoza, Argentina and owned by the Province of Mendoza. In addition, CCE and MCE have entered into a   c  onsulting   s  ervices   a  greement pursuant to which CCE provides advice on casino matters and receives a service fee consisting of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). See Note 4 for additional information related to MCE.     

Additional Project Under Development 

In September 2016, the Company was selected by Horse Racing Alberta ( HRA ) as the successful applicant to own, build and operate a horse racing facility in the Edmonton market area, which will operate as Century Mile. Century Mile will be a one-mile horse racetrack and a multi-level REC. The proposed location is on Edmonton International Airport land and close to the city of Leduc, south of Edmonton.  The Company estimates this project will cost approximately CAD   50  .0   million and be completed by the end of 2018. The Century Mile project is subject to, among other things, the Company s obtaining financing and the receipt of necessary regulatory and governmental approvals. 

Preparation of Financial Statements 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for interim financial reporting, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission which apply to interim financial statements and the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  

In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for   the   fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  . The results of operations for the period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 

11   

Presentation of Foreign Currency Amounts 

The Company s functional currency is the U.S. dollar ( USD  or  $ ).  Foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar translate assets and liabilities at current exchange rates at the end of the reporting periods, while income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the respective periods.  The Company and its subsidiaries enter into various transactions made in currencies different from their functional currencies.  These transactions are typically denom  inated in the Canadian dollar (   CAD   )  , Euro ( EUR ) and Polish zloty ( PLN ).  Gains and losses resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to these transactions are included in income from operations as they occur.   

The exchange rates to the U.S. dollar used to translate balances at the end of the reported periods are as follows: 

The average exchange rates to the U.S. dollar used to translate balances during each reported period are as follows: 

Correction of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

The Company identified errors within its statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company inadvertently failed to remove the effects of a portion of unpaid purchases of property and equipment from the change in accounts payable and purchases of property and equipment in the preparation of the statements of cash flows. This error resulted in the understatement of net cash provided by operating activities of   $1.0   million and a corresponding understatement of net cash used in investing activities of   $1.0   million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The prior period amounts within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been revised to reflect the correct balances. 

2. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard   under   US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016; provided, however, that in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year. ASU 2015-14 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standards permit retrospective application using either of the following methodologies: (i) restatement of each prior reporting period presented or (ii) recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of initial application.   In additi  on, the FASB has issued   four   related   ASU  s on principal versus agent   guidance   (ASU 2016-08)  ,   identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance (ASU 2016-10)  ,    a revision of certain SEC Staff Observer comments (ASU 2016-11) and implementation guidance (ASU 2016-12)  .    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting   these ASUs  , including the transition method to be applied; however, the standards are not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

12   

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ). The objective of ASU 2014-15 is to provide guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and annual and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-15; however, the standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). The objective of ASU 2015-11 is to simplify the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market by requiring entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2015-11 is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-11; however, the standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU 2015-16 ). The objective of ASU 2015-16 is to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for acquisitions   by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period  .    ASU 2015-16 requires adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized when they are identified.   ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.   The Company has adopted   ASU 2015-16   and it   could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements     in relation to   the Apex   A  cquisition (see Note 3). 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ). The objective of ASU 2015-17 is to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2015-17 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-17; however, the standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.   ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.  Both finance and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of use asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line lease expense.   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02.   Adoption of this standard may have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The objective of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions  , including recording all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies through income tax on the statement of earnings and eliminating the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before they can be recognized  .   ASU 2016-09 also simplifies several other aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments, including forfeitures, statutory tax withholdings requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows.   ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2016-09 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09. 

13   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to   reduce diversity in the classification of cash receipts and payments for specific cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2016-15 is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15; however, the standard is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

3.    APEX ACQUISITION

The Company makes a variety of estimates and judgments about the relevance and comparability of these factors to the reporting units in estimating their fair values. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the fair value of each reporting unit is allocated to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and whether impairment is   necessary.

8.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Litigation 

Casinos Poland 

In March 2011, the Polish Internal Revenue Service ( Polish IRS ) began conducting a series of tax audits of CPL to review the calculation and payment of personal income tax by CPL employees. Based on the March 2011 audit, the Polish IRS concluded that CPL should calculate, collect and remit to the Polish IRS personal income tax on tips received by CPL employees from casino customers  .  The Polish IRS has conducted tax audits   for the periods from December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011.   CPL has paid PLN   6.4   million (  $2.1   million)   related to these audits.  

Following multiple appeals by CPL,   the Supreme Administrative Court   issued an oral decision in March 2016, which was confirmed in a written decision issued in May 2016, finding in favor of the Polish IRS   for the tax periods of December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011.   In October 2015,   the   Voivodship Administrative Court   found in favor of CPL   for the tax period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009   on procedural grounds that the prior tax proceedings were not conducted by the appropriate taxing authority. However, the court also found that CPL s tax records for 2009 remain open for audit by a different tax authority. CPL appealed this decision to the Supreme Administrative Court in December 2015 and expects a decision in 2018.  

21   

A tax audit was not conducted for the period from   January 1, 2010 to November 30, 2010  , and the statute of limitations has passed for an audit to be conducted. A  s a result  ,   the Company adjusted   its contingent   liability to remove the estimated taxes accrued for the 2010 tax year. The adjustment reduced the contingent liability by PLN   3.4   million (  $0.9   million) in December 2015   and was recorded   as gain on foreign currency transactions and other on the Company s consolidated statement of earnings (loss) during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The balance of the potential liability on the   Company   s condensed consolidated balance sheet for all open periods as of   September 30, 2016   is estimated at PLN   8.6   million (  $2.  2   million based on the exchange rate in effect on   September 30, 2016  ).   The Company has evaluated the contingent liability recorded on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and has concluded that it is properly accrued in light of the Company s estimated obligation related to personal income tax on tips as of   September   30  , 2016.       The decision rendered by the Supreme Administrative Court in March 2016 and other proceedings by the Polish IRS may expose the Company to additional employment tax obligations in the future.  Any additional tax obligations are not probable or estimable and the Company has not recorded any additional obligation related to such taxes as of   September 30, 2016  .  Additional tax obligations assessed in the future as a result of these matters, if any, may be material to the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    T  he Company change  d     its   payroll and withholding processes   pertaining to tips received by CPL employees to comply with the Supreme Administrative Court s decision in the third quarter of 2016.    

In October 2016, the Company   filed a motion for arbitration in Poland against LOT Polish Airlines, which previously owned a   33.3%   interest in CPL that it sold to the Company in 2013. The Company is seeking to collect amounts owed to the Company by LOT Polish Airlines   in connection with the payments made to the Polish IRS for the tax periods December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and January 1, 2011 to January 31,   2011  . 

Distribution to Non-Controlling Interest 

Century Downs 

CDR has an agreement with its non-controlling shareholders to distribute any funds received by CDR related to infrastructure built during the development of the REC project.   T  he Company distributed   $0.5   million related to the infrastructure to CDR s non-controlling shareholders   in the second quarter of 2015 and   $1.6   million in the second quarter of 2016  . 

9.    INCOME TAXES  

Income tax expense is recorded relative to the jurisdictions that recognize book earnings.   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized income tax expense of   $2  .  4   million on pre-tax income of   $  11  .  3     million, representing an effective income tax rate of   21.  0  %   compared   to an income tax expense of     $0.  4   million on pre-tax income of $  12  .  7   million, representing an effective income tax rate of   3  .  2  %   for the same period in 201  5  .   

The difference between the income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of   34%   and the reported income tax expense are impacted by a number of items  .   The Company s effective tax rate is lower because there is a lower statutory tax rate in the countries where the Company pays taxes, such as Austria, Mauritius, Canada and Poland, when compared to the United States.     T  here is a  lso a   lower effective tax rate for the Company s Canadian   and Polish   operations due to exchange rate benefits  .

10  .    EARNINGS PER SHARE 

The calculation of basic earnings per share considers only weighted average outstanding common shares in the computation. The calculation of diluted earnings per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive   stock options  . The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus, if dilutive, the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. Weighted average shares outstanding for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     and 201  5   were as follows: 

The following stock options are anti-dilutive and have not been included in the weighted average shares outstanding calculation:

11.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS REPORTING 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company follows fair value measurement authoritative accounting guidance for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. That authoritative accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market or observable inputs are the preferred sources of values, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs. The fair value hierarchy for grouping these assets and liabilities is based on the significance level of the following inputs: 

Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     

Level 2   quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable     

Level 3   significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable     

A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  The Company reflects transfers between the three levels at the beginning of the reporting period in which the availability of observable inputs no longer justifies classification in the original level.   

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

The estimated fair value and basis of valuation of our financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

The Company determines the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements based on the notional amount of the swaps and the forward rate CAD-CDOR curve provided by Bloomberg and zero-coupon Canadian spot rates as of the valuation date. The Company classifies these instruments as Level 2 because the inputs into the valuation model can be corroborated utilizing observable benchmark market rates at commonly quoted intervals.  

24   

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements 

The Company applies the provision  s   of the fair value measurement standard to its non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. There were   no   assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  . 

Long-Term Debt     The carrying value of the Company s   long-term debt approximates fair value because it bears interest at the lender s variable rate for the debt related to the   BMO Credit Agreement  , the CPL credit agreements and CPL credit facility as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The estimated fair values of the outstanding balances under the BMO Credit Agreement and CPL debt are designated as Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy due to quoted prices in active markets for similar liabilities.    

Other Estimated Fair Value Measurements     The estimated fair value of   the Company s   other assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accrued payroll   and   accounts payable  ,   have been determined to approximate carrying value based on the short-term nature of those financial instruments. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , the Company had   no   cash equivalents. 

Derivative Instruments Reporting 

As of April 2015,   the Company   began using interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variable interest rates under   its   BMO Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  ,    the Company   had   two   interest rate swap agreements, each with a   notional amount   of CAD   9.4   million     (  $7.2   million based on the exchange rate in effect on   September 30, 2016  ) at a fixed CDOR rate of   3.92%   and   3.89%  , respectively,   which   were not designated as accounting hedges. These interest rate swaps reset monthly and expire on   August 15, 2019  . The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense for the related debt. Changes in the variable interest rates to be paid or received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements   are recognized in interest expense on the Company s condensed consolidated statement of earnings  . The location and effects of derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings   were as follows:

12.    SEGMENT INFORMATION 

The Company reports its financial performance in   three   reportable segments based on the geographical locations in which its casinos operate: the United States, Canada and Poland. Operating segments are aggregated within reportable segments based on their similar characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting structure. The Company s casino properties provide gaming, hotel accommodations, dining facilities and other amenities to the Company s customers. The Company s operations related to concession, management and consulting agreements and certain other corporate and management operations have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in Corporate and Other in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

Overview 

Since our inception in 1992, we have been primarily engaged in developing and operating gaming establishments and related lodging, restaurant and entertainment facilities. Our primary source of revenue is from the net proceeds of our gaming machines and tables, with ancillary revenue generated from hotel, restaurant, horse racing (including off-track betting), bowling and entertainment facilities that are in most instances a part of the casinos. 

We view each property as a separate operating segment and aggregate all such properties into three reportable segments based on the geographical locations in which our casinos operate: Canada, United States and Poland. We have additional business activities including concession, management and consulting agreements and certain other corporate and management operations that we report as Corporate and Other.

The following agreements make up the operating segment Cruise Ships   Other in the Corporate and Other reportable segment: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , w  e operate  d    1  3   ship-based casinos   through concession agreements   with     four   cruise ship owners  .    The 1  3   ship-based casinos that we operated   had a total of   2  16   slot machines and   30   tables  . The following table summarizes the cruise lines     and   the associated ships on which we operated ship-based casinos     as of   September 30, 2016  ,    and the number of slots and tables on each ship  .     

In June 2016, we began operating the ship-based casinos onboard the Mein Schiff 5, a new 2,500 passenger cruise ship, and the TUI Discovery, a 2,067 passenger cruise ship.   W  e began operating   the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea, a 1,200 passenger cruise ship  , in July 2016. Glory Sea   operates in   the Chinese cruise market with four-day trips between China, South Korea and Japan. Under an   amended concession agreement with TUI Cruises  , we also plan   to   operate   the ship-based casino onboard Mein Schiff 6,   a   new 2,500 passenger   cruise   ship scheduled to begin operations in the   third   quarter of 2017.    

In July 2016, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Dynamic regarding the operations of the ship-based casino onboard Glory Sea. Under the Cooperation Agreement, we operate the casino and Dynamic markets and promotes the casino to VIP players along with facilitating our concession agreement with Diamond  , for which we pay   Dynamic   a portion of   the   net profit from the casino   onboard Glory Sea  .    

In March 2015, we mutually agreed with Norwegian to terminate our concession agreements with Oceania and Regent, indirect subsidiaries of Norwegian, effective June 1, 2015.     We transitioned operations of the eight ship-based casinos that we operated onboard Oceania and Regent vessels to Norwegian in the second quarter of 2015.  

In March 2015, w  e entered into a two-year consulting agreement with Norwegian that became effective on June 1, 2015  . U  nder   the consulting agreement  ,   we are providing limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of $2.0 million payable $250,000 per quarter. 

33   

We have a management agreement to direct the operation of the casino at the   Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort and Casino from which w  e receive a monthly management fee.   The management agreement ends in 2017 and we do not anticipate signing a new agreement.     

Through our subsidiary CCE, we have a 7.5% ownership interest in MCE and we report our ownership interest using the cost method of accounting. MCE has an exclusive concession agreement with Instituto Provincial de Juegos y Casinos to lease slot machines and provide related services to   Casino de   Mendoza, a casino located in Mendoza, Argentina and owned by the Province of Mendoza. MCE may also pursue other gaming opportunities.   CCE has appointed one director to MCE s board of directors and has a three  -  year option   through October 2017   to purchase up to 50% of the shares of MCE.   The option can be exercised by CCE in tranches of shares, with each tranche representing not less than ten percent of the total outstanding shares of MCE. The exercise price of the shares is based upon the value of MCE at the time the option is exercised, which value is determined by a multiple of MCE s EBIT  D  A less certain debt. There are no conditions that limit CCE s ability to exercise this option.   In addition, CCE and MCE have entered into a   c  onsulting   s  ervices   a  greement pursuant to which CCE provides advice on casino matters and receives a service fee consisting of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE s EBITDA.     

Additional Project Under Development 

In   September 2016, we   were   selected   by   HRA   as the successful applicant   to own, build and operate   a horse racing facility   in the Edmonton market area  , which will operate as Century Mile  . Century Mile will be a one-mile horse racetrack and a multi-level   REC  . The proposed location is on Edmonton International Airport land and close to the city of Leduc, south of   Edmonton  .  We estimate this project will cost approximately CAD 50 million and be completed by the end of 2018.   The Century Mile project is subject to, among other things, the Company s obtaining financing and the receipt of necessary regulatory and governmental approvals. 

Presentation of Foreign Currency Amounts -   The average exchange rates to the U.S. dollar used to translate balances during each reported period are as follows: 

We recognize in our statement of earnings foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from the translation of casino operations and other transactions that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Our casinos in Canada and Poland represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty. A decrease in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars.     A  n     in  crease in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar would   in  crease the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars.

CBS   is reported in the Canada reportable segment. 

In March 2015, we mutually agreed with Norwegian to terminate our concession agreements with Oceania and Regent, indirect subsidiaries of Norwegian, effective June 1, 2015. We transitioned operations of the eight ship-based casinos that we operated onboard Oceania and Regent to Norwegian in the second quarter of 2015. As consideration for the early termination of the concession agreements, we received $4.0 million in June 2015 and recorded this on our condensed consolidated statement of earnings under operating revenue net of $0.6 million related to assets that were sold to Norwegian as part of the termination agreement.   This is included in the Corporate and Other reportable segment.     

In March 2015, we entered into a two-year consulting agreement with Norwegian that became effective on June 1, 2015. Under the consulting agreement, we are providing limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of $2.0 million payable $250,000 per quarter.   This is included in the Corporate and Other reportable segment.     

Net operating revenue increased by $1.0 million, or 3.0%, and by $0.5 million, or 0.4%,     for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Following is a breakout of net operating revenue by segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  :   

Operating costs and expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 4.2%, and by $2.7 million, or 3.1%,   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Following is a breakout of total operating costs and expenses by segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  :   

36   

Earnings from operations decreased by ($0.2) million, or (6.1%), and by ($2.3) million, or (16.1%),   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Following is a breakout of earnings from operations by segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  :   

Net earnings decreased by ($0.8) million, or (30.8%), and by ($5.1) million, or (46.0%),   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively,   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   Items deducted from or added to earnings from operations to arrive at net earnings include interest income, interest expense, gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions and other, income tax expense and non-controlling interests.  

Non-GAAP Measures   Adjusted EBITDA 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest expense (income), net, income taxes (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-controlling interest (earnings) losses and transactions, pre-opening expenses, acquisition costs, non-cash stock-based compensation charges, asset impairment costs, (gain) loss on disposition of fixed assets, discontinued operations, (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions and other, gain on business combination and certain other one-time items. Intercompany transactions consisting primarily of management and royalty fees and interest, along with their related tax effects, are excluded from the presentation of net earnings (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA reported for each segment. Not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period, but have been included in the definition based on historical activity. These adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of performance recognized under US GAAP.  

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the Company and its properties. The gaming industry commonly uses Adjusted EBITDA as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to   evaluate and     forecast the operating performance of the Company and its properties as well as to   compare   results of current periods to prior periods. Management believes that presenting Adjusted EBITDA to investors provides them with information used by management for financial and operational decision making in order to understand the Company s operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Management believes that using Adjusted EBITDA is a useful way to compare   the relative operating performance of separate   reporting segments   by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue, and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry. 

37   

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings (loss) is presented below. 

38   

Non-GAAP Measures   Net Debt 

We define   N  et   D  ebt as total long-term debt   (including current portion)   plus deferred financing costs minus cash and cash equivalents.   Net Debt is not considered a liquidity measure recognized under US GAAP.   Management believes that Net Debt is a valuable measure of our overall financial situation. Net Debt provides investors with an indication of our ability to pay off all of our   long-term   debt if   it   became due simultaneously. The reconciliation of Net Debt is presented below.

In March 2011, the Polish Internal Revenue Service ( Polish IRS ) began conducting a series of tax audits of CPL to review the calculation and payment of personal income tax by CPL employees. Based on the March 2011 audit, the Polish IRS concluded that CPL should calculate, collect and remit to the Polish IRS personal income tax on tips received by CPL employees from casino customers.  The Polish IRS has conducted tax audits for the periods from December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011. On March 9, 2016, CPL received an oral decision from the Supreme Administrative Court for the tax periods of December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 and January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011. The court found in favor of the Polish IRS. CPL   received the   written decision from the court in the second quarter of 2016   that confirmed the oral decision  . See Note 8,  Commitments and Contingencies,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

The balance of the potential liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for all open periods as of September 30, 2016 is estimated at PLN 8.6 million ($2.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016). We have evaluated the contingent liability recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and have concluded that it is properly accrued in light of our estimated obligation related to personal income tax on tips. The decision rendered by the Supreme Administrative Court in March 2016 and other proceedings by the Polish IRS may expose us to additional employment tax obligations in the future. Any additional tax obligations are not probable or estimable and we have not recorded any additional obligation related to such taxes as of September 30, 2016. Additional tax obligations assessed in the future as a result of these matters, if any, may be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To address these issues, we changed the payroll and withholding processes for   CPL   beginning in the third quarter of 2016. As a result of these changes, payroll costs for the third quarter   of   2016 increased by PLN 1.5 million ($0.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016)  .     W  e anticipate   annual   payroll costs to increase by approximately PLN 5.0 million ($1.3 million based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016).

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

We terminated our concession agreements with Oceania and Regent, indirect subsidiaries of Norwegian, effective June 1, 2015. We transitioned operations of the eight ship-based casinos that we operated onboard Oceania and Regent vessels to Norwegian during the second quarter of 2015. As consideration for the early termination of the concession agreements, we received $4.0 million in June 2015 and recorded this on our condensed consolidated statement of earnings under operating revenue net of $0.6 million related to assets that were sold to Norwegian as part of the termination agreement. We also entered into a consulting agreement with Norwegian effective June 1, 2015, under which we are providing limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of $2.0 million that is payable in eight quarterly installments of $250,000 that commenced in July 2015. 

The following discussion highlights results   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

Revenue Highlights 

Net operating revenue remained constant due to the additional revenue from the Mein Schiff 5, Thomson Discovery and Glory Sea offset by the decreased revenue from a casino onboard a cruise ship that we no longer operate.     

Operating Expense Highlights 

Operating expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 7.4  %, due to increased cruise ship-related expenses resulting from the additional payroll and setup costs associated with opening the casino onboard Glory Sea.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following discussion highlights results   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

Revenue Highlights 

Net operating revenue decreased ($4.4) million, or (62.7%),   because of $3.4 million of revenue related to   the termination of the concession agreements with Oceania and Regent   that we recognized in the 2015 period   and decreased revenue   related to   a casino onboard a cruise ship that we no longer operate, offset by an additional five months of revenue from the consulting agreement with Norwegian and revenue from beginning casino operations onboard Mein Schiff 5, Thomson Discovery and Glory Sea.     

Operating Expense Highlights 

Operating expenses decreased by ($1.8) million, or (19.1  %), primarily due to decreased cruise ship-related expenses as a result of the termination of the concession agreements with Oceania and Regent and decreased stock compensation expense.     

Additional Items Impacting Net Income 

Income tax expense increased by $1.6 million, or 52.1%, as a result of releasing the Austrian valuation allowance of ($1.6) million in the second quarter of 2015, which did not recur during 2016  .     

A reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in the  Non-GAAP Measures   Adjusted EBITDA  discussion above. 

Non-Operating Income (Expense) 

Non-operating income (expense) for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     and 201  5   was as follows: 

Interest income 

Interest income is directly related to interest earned on our cash reserves. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense is directly related to interest owed on our   credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal (the    BMO Credit Agreement   ),   the fair value adjustments for our interest rate swap agreements  , our CPL borrowings,   and interest expense related to CDR s land lease   and CRA   s   and CDR s capital lease agreements  . Prior to the acquisition of our ownership interest in CDR, CDR sold a portion of the land on which the REC project   is located   and then entered into an agreement to lease back a portion of the land sold. We account for the lease using the financing method, accounting for the land subject to the lease as an asset and the lease payments as interest on the financing obligation.  

49   

Gain on Foreign Currency Transactions and Other 

Gain on foreign currency transactions and other includes $1.6 million and $0.5 million received by CDR related to infrastructure built during the development of the REC project for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The distribution to CDR s non-controlling shareholders through non-controlling interest is part of the credit agreement between CCE and CDR. 

Taxes 

Income tax expense is recorded relative to the jurisdictions that recognize book earnings. During the   nine months     ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized income tax expense of $  2.4   million on pre-tax income of $  11.3   million, representing an effective income tax rate of   21.  0  % compared to an income tax expense of   less than   $0.  4   million on pre-tax income of $  12.7   million, representing an effective income tax rate of   3.2  % for the same period in 2015. 

The difference between the income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 34% and the reported income tax expense are impacted by a number of items. Our effective tax rate is lower because there is a lower statutory tax rate in the countries where we pay taxes, such as Austria, Mauritius, Canada and Poland, when compared to the United States.     There is also   a lower effective tax rate for our Canadian   and Polish   operations due to exchange rate benefits  .     In addition, w  e continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets and on certain Canadian deferred tax assets.    

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our business is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow. We use the cash flows that we generate to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing activities.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt under bank borrowings and other agreements   net of $0.  4   million related to deferred financing costs   was $  58.  4   million, of which $  5  2  .  8   million was long-term debt   and    $  5.5   million was   the current portion of long  -term debt.   The   current portion   relates to payments due within one year under our BMO Credit Agreement, CPL s two credit agreements and other capital lease agreements.  We intend to repay the   current portion of our   debt obligations with available cash. In September 2016, we increased our borrowing capacity on our BMO Credit Agreement to CAD 69.2 million to finance the Apex Acquisition. The increased credit facility added CAD 30.0 million ($22.9 million based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016) to our debt balance, of which CAD 3.0 million ($2.3 million based on the exchange rate in effect on September 30, 2016) was   the current portion  .   For a description of our debt agreements, see Note 7,  Long-Term Debt,  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.     Net   D  ebt     was $  25.8   million as of   September 30, 2016  .    For the definition and reconciliation of Net Debt to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see  Non-GAAP Measures   Net Debt  above.

The following table lists the amount of 2016 maturities of our debt: 

Cash Flows 

At   September 30, 2016  , c  ash and cash equivalents totaled $  33.0   million, and we had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $  1  4  .  5   million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $2  9.4   million and working capital of $  11.2   million at December 31, 201  5  .    The increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2015 is due to $  15.  6   million of net cash provided by operating activities, $0.1 million from the exercise of stock options and   $19.  1   million received under various loan agreements net of principal repayments  . The cash provided by these activities was offset by   $23.2 million held in restricted cash for the Apex Acquisition,    $  5.  0   million used to purchase property and equipment, $1.  9   million used for a distribution to non-controlling interests  , $0.2 million used   for payment of deferred financing costs related to the BMO Credit Agreement     and $  0.9   million   in exchange rate changes  .    

We identified errors within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We inadvertently failed to remove the effects of a portion of unpaid purchases of property and equipment from the change in accounts payable and purchases of property and equipment in the preparation of the statements of cash flows. This error resulted in the understatement of net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million and a corresponding understatement of net cash used in investing activities, in the same amount, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The prior period amounts within the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been revised to reflect the correct balances. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.  6   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and $  14.3   million for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .    Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $3.4 million from the termination of the concession agreements.   Our cash flows from operations have historically been positive and sufficient to fund ordinary operations. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in earnings from operations, excluding non-cash charges. Please refer to the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and to management s discussion of the results of operations above in this Item 2 for a discussion of earnings from operations.  

Net cash used in investing activities of $28.  2   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of   $1.4 million in various projects for   CDR   including construction of a second barn and parking lots and landscaping, $1.4 million to renovate   CRA  , $0.5 million in gaming equipment and furniture for three new cruise ships, $0.1 million to purchase new slot machines for   CRC  , $0.1 million to purchase new slot machines for   CTL  , $0.1 million for hotel upgrades for   CTL  ,  $0.5 million to purchase new slot machines and table games for   CPL,   $0.9 million in other fixed asset additions at our properties   and   $23.2 million held in restricted cash for the Apex Acquisition that closed on October 1, 2016  , offset by   less than $0.1 million in proceeds from the disposition of fi  xed assets.  

Net cash used in investing activities of $  14.7   million for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   consisted of $  12.2 million for development costs related to the REC project, $0.5 million to purchase new slot machines and table equipment for the casinos operated by   CPL  , $0.1 million in improvements to the casinos in Poznan and Katowice operated by   CPL  , $0.1 million to purchase new sign displays for the casinos in Warsaw and Wroclaw by   CPL  , $0.3 million to purchase new slot machines for the Mein Schiff 4, Star Breeze and Star Legend ship-based casinos, $0.5 million to purchase slot machines for   CRC   and   CTL  , $0.1 million to purchase new surveillance equipment at   CRC  , $0.1 million in sound equipment for the showroom and $0.1 million in parking lot repairs at   CRA  , $0.1 million to remodel a restaurant and kitchen at   CAL   and $1.3 million in cumulative additions at our properties, offset by $0.7 million in proceeds from the disposition of assets  . 

51   

Net cash provided by financing activities of $17.  1   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $19.  1   million cash received under various loan agreements net of principal repayments and $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, offset by $1.9 million in distributions to non-controlling interests   and $0.2 million in deferred financing payments  . 

Net cash provided by financing activities of $  6.3   million for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   consisted of $  6.8   million cash received under various loan agreements net of principal repayments   and $0.1 million cash from the exercise of stock options, offset by a $0.5 million distribution to non-controlling interests in CDR  .   

Common Stock Repurchase Program 

Since 2000, we have had a discretionary program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. In November 2009, we increased the amount available to be repurchased to $15.0 million. We did not repurchase any common stock during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The total amount remaining under the repurchase program was $14.7 million as of   September 30, 2016  . The repurchase program has no set expiration or termination date. 

Potential Sources of Liquidity, Short-Term Liquidity 

Historically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, sales of existing casino operations and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. 

We expect that the primary source of cash will be from our gaming operations   and additional borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement  . In addition to the payment of operating costs, expected uses of cash within one year include capital expenditures for our existing properties, interest and principal payments on outstanding debt  , payments for the Apex Acquisition, the construction of Century Mile   and potential new projects or dividends, if declared by the board of directors.   We amended the BMO Credit Agreement to obtain the financing needed for the Apex Acquisition which was completed on October 1, 2016.   If necessary, we may seek to obtain   additional   term loans, mortgages or lines of credit with commercial banks or other debt or equity financings to supplement our working capital and investing requirements.  

We believe that our cash at   September 30, 2016  , as supplemented by cash flows from operations   and additional borrowings under the BMO Credit Agreement  , will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating costs, capital expenditures at existing properties and current debt repayment obligations for at least the next 12 months. We will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations. From time to time we expect to have cash needs for the development or purchase of new properties  , including the potential Century Mile project,   that exceed our current borrowing capacity and we may be required to seek additional debt, equity or bank financing.  

In addition, we expect our U.S. domestic cash resources will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities. While we currently do not have an intent nor foresee a need to repatriate funds, we could require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our U.S. operations for operations, capital expenditures or significant discretionary activities such as acquisitions o  f   businesses and share repurchases. If so, we could elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, which could have adverse tax consequences, as we have not accrued taxes for un-repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that approximately $2  6.7   million of our total $  33.0   million in cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   is held by our foreign subsidiaries and is not available to fund U.S. operations unless repatriated. The determination of the additional deferred taxes that would be provided for undistributed earnings has not been determined because the hypothetical calculation is not practicable.

Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.      

We had no material changes in our exposure to market risks from that previously reported in   Item   7A   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4.        Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officers and principal financial/accounting officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, for the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial/accounting officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds      

In March 2000, our board of directors approved a discretionary program to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our outstanding common stock. In November 2009, our board of directors approved an increase of the amount available to be repurchased under the program to $15.0 million. The repurchase program has no set expiration or termination date and had approximately $14.7 million remaining as of   September 30, 2016  . There were no repurchases of common stock during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .
