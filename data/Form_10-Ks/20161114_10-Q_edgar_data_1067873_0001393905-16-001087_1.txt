NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016     (UNAUDITED)         Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies         Basis of Presentation    The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles used in the United States of America and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information.  Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations.       The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar.  The unaudited financial statements are expressed in United States dollars.  It is management's opinion that any material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.  The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year.       For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.        Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.       Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, due to continuing and expected future losses, and share-based payments.       Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.        Per Share Data    Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, "Earnings per Share". Basic earnings per common share ("EPS") calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.        7          Cash and cash equivalents:    For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.        Income taxes    The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-10, "Income Taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.        Fair value of financial instruments:    The carrying value of cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.        Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue on an accrual basis. Revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between the Company and our customer(s); 2) services have been rendered; 3) our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.        Long-lived Assets    In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, "Property, Plant and Equipment," the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and future revenue for each asset with an annual minimum equal to the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the asset.        Stock-based compensation    The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718, which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.       ASC 505, "Compensation-Stock Compensation", establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to non employees for goods or services. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505.        8          Recent pronouncements    Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.        Note 2. Going Concern        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had an Accumulated Deficit of $9,586,161 at September 30, 2016 and will be required to make significant expenditures in connection with development of the BizjetMobile and fflya businesses, seeking addition funding through investments and general and administrative expenses.  The Company's ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its raising of capital through debt or equity financing in order to meet its working capital needs.       These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, and if substantial additional funding is not acquired or alternative sources developed, management will be required to curtail its operations.       The Company may raise additional capital by the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or from borrowing from a financial institution. The Company does not have a policy on the amount of borrowing or debt that the Company can incur. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provides the additional opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available or on acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.        Note 3. Related Party Transactions        As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company has recorded as "related party payables", $277,133 and $252,761, respectively, which are due mainly to advances made by the CEO to pay for operating expenses. From July 1, 2016, interest will accrue on amounts due to the CEO calculated quarterly at a rate of 6.5% per annum. The loan will be repaid from surplus operating cash, when funds are available.       As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company had "due to related parties" of $228,811 and $228,811 respectively which are advances made by related parties to provide capital and outstanding directors fees. These amounts are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand.       The Company in the three months ending September 30, 2016 and in the three months ended September 30, 2015 incurred expenses of approximately $17,000 and $15,000 respectively to entities affiliated through common stockholders and directors for management expenses. These expenses have been classified as officer s management fees in the accompanying financial statements. Amounts payable and due to related parties remain as a liability on terms referred to above, or until paid with cash or settled with shares of stock.        9         The Company in the three months ending September 30, 2016 incurred expenses of approximately $33,000 for marketing and $12,000 for support services to entities affiliated through common stockholders and directors. The expenses have been paid when due.        Note 4. Stockholders' Deficit        During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,342,500 shares of common stock, resulting in an increase in Common Stock of $234 and an increase in Additional Paid-In Capital by $46,616.        Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies        The Company has an outstanding loan arrangement with a third party, with balance outstanding at September 30, 2016 of $49,133 (September 30, 2015 $53,531). Interest is calculated at a rate of 20% with increasing monthly principal and interest payments.                                                                                                                                             10                ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        This quarterly report on form 10-Q includes "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "could", "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend" or "project" or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.  These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect.  Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.        RESULTS AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS         THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015        In the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded revenue of $61,826, compared to revenue of $903 in the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2015. The increased revenue resulted from the Company assuming distribution of the BizjetMobile products and cancellation of the Company s license for its intellectual property to ASiQ Limited, effective November 1, 2015. After Cost of Sales of $24,434, the Company had a Gross Profit of $37,392 in the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded Cost of Sales of nil, which resulted in a Gross Profit of $903.       The change in the operations of the Company has resulted in the Company assuming a higher cost structure including costs for marketing, communication data, technical and product support. Consequently, expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased to $194,859 from $57,310 in the three months ended September 30, 2015.       The Company had a net loss of $157,467 in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $56,407 in the three month period ended September 30, 2015.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        The cash and cash equivalents balance decreased from $64,292 at July 1, 2016 to $31,440 at September 30, 2016.        11         The Company reported revenue of $61,826 in the three months ending September 30, 2016 compared to $903 in the three month period ending September 30, 2015. The Company incurred a net loss of $157,467 from operating activities for the period July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $56,407 from operating activities for the period July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities increased to $142,333 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,924 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased operating costs under the new operating arrangement.       The cash flow of the Company from financing activities for the three months ending September 30, 2016 was $109,481 as a result of proceeds from issue of common stock and funds received pending issue of common stock, compared to $17,734 from a non-related loan in the nine months ending September 30, 2015.       The Company may raise additional capital by the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or from borrowing from a financial institution or other funding sources. The Company does not have a policy on the amount of borrowing or debt that the Company can incur. There are no guarantees on the company s ability to raise additional capital.          ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        Not applicable          ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        (a)  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures .       Our management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, and the Company's President, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.       Based upon that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are adequate and effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance however, that the effectiveness of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any, within a company have been detected.                            12         (b)  Changes in internal controls .       The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, and President, evaluated whether any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that no change occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

RISK FACTORS        The Company is a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide this information.          ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS        As noted in "Note 4. Stockholders  Deficit" in the Financial Statements above, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,342,500 shares of common stock valued at $46,850 for cash, that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  The offer, sale and issuance of these securities was made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided for by Section 4(2) thereof for transactions not involving a public offering.  Appropriate legends have been affixed to the securities issued in these transactions.  The purchasers of the securities had adequate access, through business or other relationships, to information about the Company.       During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $63,889 for purchase of shares of common stock, which are yet to be issued.          ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES        None          ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES        None          ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION        None                13                ITEM 6.
