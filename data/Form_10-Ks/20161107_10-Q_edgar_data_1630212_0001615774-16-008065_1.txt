(1)     Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation and Organization  

Avalon
GloboCare Corp. (f/k/a Global Technologies Corp.) (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation. The Company was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 28, 2014. On October 18, 2016, the Company changed its name to
Avalon  GloboCare Corp. and reverse split its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1:4. On October 19, 2016, the Company
entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Avalon Healthcare System, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ( AHS ), each of which are accredited investors ( AHS Shareholders ) pursuant to which we
acquired 100% of the outstanding securities of AHS in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock (the  AHS
Acquisition ).  As a result of such acquisition, the Company s operations now are focused on providing
outsourced, customized international healthcare services to the rapidly changing health care industry primarily focused in
the Peoples Republic of China. The Company is also pursuing the provision of these services in the United States as well as
certain strategic partnerships and property ownership and management. AHS owns 100% of the capital stock of Avalon (Shanghai)
Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. ( Avalon Shanghai ), which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise organized under
the laws of the People s Republic of China ( PRC  or  China ). Avalon Shanghai was incorporated
on April 29, 2016 and is engaged in medical related consulting services for customers. 

The Company is
in the process of raising additional fund to support its development activities. 

The Company s
activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize
the Company s technology and to properly execute the Company s business plan. 

The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company were prepared from the accounts of the Company under the accrual basis
of accounting. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The interim financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and for the period then ended are unaudited. However, in the opinion of management,
the interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present
fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the period ended September 30, 2016. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the calendar year
ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying financial statements and notes thereto do not reflect all disclosures required under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). Refer to the Company s audited financial
statements as of December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC, for additional information, including significant accounting policies. 

The condensed balance sheet as of December
31, 2015 contained herein has been derived from the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015, but do not include all
disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 

Cash and Cash
Equivalents  

For purposes of
reporting within the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions
or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company is
in the development stage and has yet to realize revenues from operations. Once the Company has commenced operations, it will recognize
revenues when completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, acceptance has been approved
by its customers, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions, and collection of any
related receivable is probable. 

5   

Loss per Common
Share  

Basic loss per
share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. There were no dilutive financial instruments issued
or outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences
between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and
liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences. 

The Company maintains
a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential
likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company s financial position and results
of operations for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable
income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws. 

Changes in circumstances,
such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred
tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid
to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and
(2) a reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1 - Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Inputs
that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

The Company estimates
the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and valuation methods. Considerable judgment is
required in estimating fair value. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could
realize in a current market exchange. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, and loans from related parties   directors and stockholders approximated fair value due to the short-term
nature and maturity of these instruments. 

Deferred Offering
Costs  

The Company defers
as other assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital until such time as the offering is completed. At the time of the
completion of the offering, the costs are charged against the capital raised. Should the offering be terminated, deferred offering
costs are charged to operations during the period in which the offering is terminated. 

6   

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company evaluates
the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives when events or circumstances lead management
to believe that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As of and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, no events or circumstances occurred for which an evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets was required. 

Common Stock Registration Expenses  

The Company considers
incremental costs and expenses related to the registration of equity securities with the SEC, whether by contractual arrangement
as of a certain date or by demand, to be unrelated to original issuance transactions. As such, subsequent registration costs and
expenses are expensed as incurred. 

Estimates  

The financial
statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and expenses for the period
ended September 30, 2016. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Reverse Stock
Split  

The Company effected
an one-for-four reverse stock split of its common stock on October 18, 2016. All share and per share information has been retroactively
adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split. 

Fiscal Year End  

The Company has
adopted a fiscal year end of December 31st. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various
other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific
industries.  None of the updates are expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. 

(2)     Going
Concern  

The Company currently
has limited operations. The Company s operations now are focused on providing outsourced, customized international healthcare
services to the rapidly changing health care industry primarily focused in the Peoples Republic of China. The Company is also pursuing
the provision of these services in the United States as well as certain strategic partnerships and property ownership and management. 

The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not established any
source of revenue to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further, as of September
30, 2016, the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its current business plan. These and other factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern. 

(3)     Loans
from Related Parties - Directors and Stockholders  

As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans from related parties amounted to $0 and $4,700, respectively. The loans represent working
capital advances from former Directors who are also former stockholders of the Company. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing,
and due on demand. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $27,250 working capital loans from
related parties and the Company s former Directors and former stockholders converted $31,950 loans owed by the Company into
capital contribution. 

7   

(4)     Equity  

The Company is authorized to issue
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 490,000,000 shares of common shares with a par value of $0.0001. 

There are no shares of its preferred
stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

There are 1,750,000 shares of its common
stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

(5)     Income
Taxes  

The provisions
(benefit) for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows (assuming a 34% effective tax
rate): 

The Company had
deferred income tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as follows: 

The Company provided
a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, because
it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforwards. 

As of September
30, 2016, the Company had approximately $61,100 in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future periods to reduce taxable
income, and expire by the year 2036. 

The Company did
not identify any material uncertain tax positions.  The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized
tax benefits. 

The Company files
income tax returns in the United States. All tax years are closed by expiration of the statute of limitations. 

(6)     Related
Party Transactions  

As described in
Note 3, as of December 31, 2015, the Company owed $4,700 to former Directors, former officers, and former principal stockholders
of the Company for working capital loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $27,250 working
capital loans from its former Directors, former officers, and former principal stockholders. The Company s former Directors,
former officers, and former stockholders converted $31,950 loans owed by the Company into capital contribution in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, with a corresponding debit to the loans from related parties   directors and stockholders and credit
to additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of loans from related parties  
directors and stockholders was zero. 

8   

(7) Subsequent Events  

On October 18,
2016, the Company s corporate name was changed to Avalon GloboCare Corp. 

On October 19, 2016, the Company
entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Avalon Healthcare System Inc.
( AHS ). In addition, the Company entered into a plan of reorganization with AHS. The Company issued 50,000,000
shares of its common stock for 100% of the outstanding shares of AHS. As a result of the transaction, shareholders of AHS
owned 99.5% of the combined entity upon completion of the transaction. The transaction will be recorded as a reverse
acquisition and recapitalization wherein Avalon GloboCare Corp., is the legal acquirer and whereas AHS, (the operating
company), is the accounting acquirer. 

On October 19, 2016, the Company issued
1,056,122 shares of its common stock to a third party for legal services rendered.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

As used in this Form 10-Q, references to
 Avalon GloboCare Corp. , the  Company ,  we ,  our  or  us  refer
to Avalon GloboCare Corp., unless the context otherwise indicates. 

Forward-Looking Statements   

Some of the statements contained in this
Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are  forward-looking statements  which can be identified by the use of terminology
such as  estimates,   projects,   plans,   believes,   expects,   anticipates, 
 intends,  or the negative or other variations, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We
urge you to be cautious of the forward-looking statements, that such statements, which are contained in this Form 10-Q, reflect
our current beliefs with respect to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors affecting
our operations, market growth, services, products and licenses. No assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future
results, as actual results may differ materially as a result of the risks we face, and actual events may differ from the assumptions
underlying the statements that have been made regarding anticipated events. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance
or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without
limitation: 

Our ability to attract and retain management;  

Our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms and conditions;  

The intensity of competition;  

General economic conditions;  

Changes in regulations;  

Whether the market for healthcare services continues to grow, and, if it does, the pace at which it may grow; and  

Our ability to compete against large competitors in a rapidly changing market.  

All written and oral forward-looking statements
made in connection with this Form 10-Q that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by these cautionary statements. Given the uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our Plan of Operation should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
included herein and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016. 

Corporate Background   

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware
on July 28, 2014 and are a development stage company. Our initial business plan involved the development of a software solution
connecting via Bluetooth or similar technology to a Tablet or iPad that is connected to the cash register at a wide variety of
retail outlets. This activity ceased in September 2016. The Company s operations are focused on providing outsourced, customized
international healthcare services to the rapidly changing health care industry primarily focused in the Peoples Republic of China.
The Company is also pursuing the provision of these services in the United States as well as certain strategic partnerships and
property ownership and management. 

Results of Operations  

Results of operations for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenues and Net Loss   

We did not generate any revenues from operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the operating expenses and the net losses were $1,104 and $12,265, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the operating expenses and the net losses were $26,544 and $24,065, respectively. The operating expenses
and net losses were primarily the result of professional fees, legal, Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) eligibility
fees, and auditing. 

10   

We expect to continue to incur significant
operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We
expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be
unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our cash balance as of September 30, 2016
was $0. Cash and cash equivalents from inception to date have been sufficient to provide the operating capital necessary to operate
to date. We are currently seeking to financing.  Financing transactions may include the issuance
of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.   

Going Concern Consideration   

Our former auditors have issued an opinion
on our annual financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern status. This means that there is substantial
doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills
and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until
we begin marketing the product. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report. The term  disclosure controls and procedures , as defined under Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based
upon the evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective  as a result of weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting which are as follows: 

- 
     The Company has not established adequate financial reporting monitoring activities to mitigate the risk of management override, specifically because there are few employees and only two officers with management functions and therefore there is lack of segregation of duties.  

- 
     There is a strong reliance on outside consultants to review and adjust the annual and quarterly financial statements, to monitor new accounting principles, and to ensure compliance with GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.  

- 
     There is a strong reliance on the external attorneys to review and edit the annual and quarterly filings and to ensure compliance with SEC disclosure requirements.  

- 
     A formal audit committee has not been formed.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
