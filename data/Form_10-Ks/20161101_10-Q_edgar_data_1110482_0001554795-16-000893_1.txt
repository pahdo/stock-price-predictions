 Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 September 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   Condensed Financial Statements 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period
ended September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31, 2015 audited financial statements as reported
in its Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for the full year ended December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 2   Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since
inception, has negative cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited
for the past several years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies. 

NOTE 3   Recent Pronouncement 

  On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage entity
from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US GAAP.
In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information
on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development
stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose
in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development
stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim reporting period
for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly
have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented inception-to-date information
on the respective financial statements . 

NOTE 4   Subsequent Events 

The Company has evaluated subsequent events
from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no such events
that would have a material impact on the financial statements. 

In this report references to  Wings   Things, 
 the Company,   we,   us,  and  our  refer to Wings   Things, Inc.  

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects
and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as  may,   expect, 
 believe,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,  or  continue 
or comparable terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify
forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to
a number of important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Executive Overview   

We have not recorded revenues for the past two fiscal years and
we are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management,
significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing
funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue. 

As of the date of this report management is investigating a potential
merger or acquisition of a company; however, we have not entered into any definitive agreement relating to a transaction as of
the filing date of this report. We anticipate that the evaluation of this opportunity will be complex. We expect that our due diligence
will encompass meetings with its business management and inspection of its operations, as well as review of financial and other
information that may be available to our management. This review may be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third
party consultants that the Company may engage. The Company s limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely
make it impracticable to conduct an exhaustive investigation. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will
be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries
and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming
a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available
business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task
of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to
raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that we
would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The
purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that
if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common
stock. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient
to cover our operating costs and we have relied primarily upon loans from related and third parties to provide and pay for professional
expenses. At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $2,263 compared to $425 cash at December 31, 2015. Our total liabilities increased
to $290,127 at September 30, 2016 compared to $265,096 at December 31, 2015. The increase in total liabilities for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 primarily represents cash advances of $8,300 from a third party, accrued interest of $12,231, along
with accounts payable of $ 5,300 related to advances and consulting fees and accounts payable for professional services provided
by or paid on our behalf by a vendor. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders
and third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability
to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire
or enter into a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability
for the long term. 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs
related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans provided
by management, significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash
to convert debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations   

We did not record revenues during 2016 and 2015. General and administrative
expense decreased to $10,962 for the September 30, 2016 nine month period compared to $12,206 for the 2015 nine month period. General
and administrative expense decreased to $2,710 for the September 30, 2016 third quarter compared to $3,000 for the 2015 third quarter.
The decrease in general and administrative expense in the 2016 nine month period primarily reflects reduced consulting and professional
fees provided by or paid for by related and third parties. 

Total other expense represents accrued interest on notes payable.
Total other expense increased to $12,231 for the 2016 nine month period compared to $10,171 for the 2015 nine month period. Total
other expense increased to $4,109 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $3,435 for the 2015 third quarter. 

Accordingly, our net loss increased to $23,193 for the 2016 nine
month period compared to $22,377 for the 2015 nine month period. Net loss increased to $6,819 for the 2016 third quarter compared
to $6,435 for the 2015 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations   

At September 30, 2016 we recorded notes payable of $209,000 with
accrued interest of $67,427. All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand. During
2016 nine month period we borrowed $8,300 from a third party. 

At September 30, 2016 we recorded accounts payable of $13,700 representing
administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided to or paid on behalf of the Company by a more than 5%
shareholder, First Equity Holdings Corp. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will
not be required to: 

Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   

Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency    

Obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and   

Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance
and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.   

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of
this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with
such new or revised accounting standards. 

We will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to
five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed
$1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued
more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties
to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate
this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation
of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.
