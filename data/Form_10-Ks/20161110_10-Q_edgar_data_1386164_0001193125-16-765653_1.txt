   Managed Futures Premier Abingdon L.P.   
    Notes to Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)      1. Organization:   
 Managed Futures Premier Abingdon L.P. (the  Partnership ) is a limited partnership organized on November 8,
2005, under the partnership laws of the State of New York, to engage, directly or indirectly, in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of commodity interests including futures, option, swap and forward contracts. The sectors traded
include currencies, energy, grains, indices, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock, lumber, metals and softs. The Partnership commenced trading on February 1, 2007. The commodity interests that are indirectly traded by the Partnership
through its investment in CMF Winton Master L.P. (the  Master ) are volatile and involve a high degree of market risk. The General Partner (defined below) may also determine to invest up to all of the Partnership s assets in United
States ( U.S. ) Treasury bills and/or money market mutual funds, including money market mutual funds managed by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates. The Partnership privately and continuously offers redeemable units of limited partnership
interest in the Partnership ( Redeemable Units ) to qualified investors. There is no maximum number of Redeemable Units that may be sold by the Partnership.  
 Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acts as the general partner (the  General Partner )
and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. The General Partner is wholly owned by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC ( MSSB Holdings ). MSSB Holdings is ultimately owned by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley is a publicly held
company whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley is engaged in various financial services and other businesses. Prior to June 28, 2013, Morgan Stanley indirectly owned a majority equity interest in MSSB Holdings
and Citigroup Inc. indirectly owned a minority equity interest in MSSB Holdings. Prior to July 31, 2009, the date as of which MSSB Holdings became its owner, the General Partner was wholly owned by Citigroup Financial Products Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., the sole owner of which is Citigroup Inc. All trading decisions for the Partnership are made by Winton Capital Management Limited (the  Advisor ).  
 During the reporting periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership s and the Master s commodity
broker was Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ), a registered futures commission merchant. The Partnership and the Master also deposit a portion of their cash in non-trading accounts at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  
 On February 1, 2007, the Partnership allocated substantially all of its capital to the Master, a limited partnership
organized under the partnership laws of the State of New York, having the same investment objective as the Partnership. The Partnership purchased 9,017.0917 units of the Master with cash equal to $12,945,000. The Master permits accounts managed by
the Advisor using the Winton Futures Program (formerly, the Winton Diversified Program, as applied without equities), the Advisor s proprietary, systematic trading program, to invest together in one trading vehicle. The General Partner is also
the general partner of the Master. Individual and pooled accounts currently managed by the Advisor, including the Partnership, are permitted to be limited partners of the Master. The General Partner and the Advisor believe that trading through this
master/feeder structure promotes efficiency and economy in the trading process. Expenses to investors as a result of the investment in the Master are approximately the same as if the Partnership traded directly, and redemption rights are not
affected. The General Partner and the Advisor agreed that the Advisor will trade the Partnership s assets allocated to the Advisor at a level that is up to 1.5 times the amount of assets allocated.  
 A limited partner in the Master may withdraw all or part of its capital contribution and undistributed profits, if any, from
the Master as of the end of any month (the  Redemption Date ) after a request has been made to the General Partner at least three days in advance of the Redemption Date. Such withdrawals are classified as a liability when the limited
partner in the Master elects to redeem and informs the Master.    The General Partner is not aware of any material changes
to the trading program discussed above during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  (Unaudited)       
  On April 1, 2011, the Partnership began offering  Class A 
Redeemable Units,  Class D  Redeemable Units and  Class Z  Redeemable Units pursuant to the offering memorandum. All Redeemable Units issued prior to April 1, 2011 were deemed Class A Redeemable Units. The rights,
liabilities, risks, and fees associated with investment in the Class A Redeemable Units did not change.  Class D  Redeemable Units and  Class Z  Redeemable Units were first issued on April 1, 2011 and August 1,
2011, respectively. Class A, Class D and Class Z will each be referred to as a  Class  and collectively referred to as the  Classes.  The Class of Redeemable Units that a limited partner receives upon a subscription will
generally depend upon the amount invested in the Partnership or the status of the limited partner, although the General Partner may determine to offer any Class of Redeemable Units to investors at its discretion. Class Z Redeemable Units are offered
to limited partners who receive advisory services from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (doing business as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management) ( Morgan Stanley Wealth Management ) and certain employees of Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries
(and their family members). Class A Redeemable Units, Class D Redeemable Units, and Class Z Redeemable Units are identical, except that Class D Redeemable Units are subject to a monthly ongoing selling agent fee equal to 1/12th of 0.75% (a
0.75% annual rate) of the net assets of Class D as of the end of each month, which differs from the Class A monthly ongoing selling agent fee of 1/12th of 2.00% (a 2.00% annual rate) of the net assets of Class A as of the end of each
month. Class Z Redeemable Units are not subject to a monthly ongoing selling agent fee.    At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Partnership owned approximately 44.1% and 38.9%, respectively, of the Master. The Partnership intends to continue to invest substantially all of its assets in the Master. The performance of the Partnership is directly
affected by the performance of the Master. The Master s trading of futures, forward, swap and option contracts, if applicable, on commodities is done primarily on U.S. and foreign commodity exchanges. The Master engages in such trading through
a commodity brokerage account maintained with MS Co. The Master s Statements of Financial Condition, Condensed Schedules of Investments and Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital are included herein.  
 The Master has entered into a foreign exchange brokerage account agreement and a futures brokerage account agreement with
MS Co. The Partnership has also entered into a futures brokerage account agreement with MS Co. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, pays MS Co. (or will reimburse MS Co., if previously paid) its allocable share of
all trading fees for the clearing and, where applicable, execution of transactions as well as exchange, clearing, user, give-up, floor brokerage and National Futures Association fees (collectively, the  clearing fees ).  
 The Partnership has also entered into a selling agreement with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (as amended, the  Selling
Agreement ). Pursuant to the Selling Agreement, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is paid a monthly ongoing selling agent fee at the rates described above. The ongoing selling agent fee received by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is shared with
the properly registered/exempted financial advisors of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management who sell Class A and/or Class D Redeemable Units.  
 In July 2015, the General Partner delegated certain administrative functions to SS C Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, currently doing business as SS C GlobeOp (the  Administrator ). Pursuant to a master services agreement, the Administrator furnishes certain administrative, accounting, regulatory reporting, tax and other services as
agreed from time to time. In addition, the Administrator maintains certain books and records of the Partnership. The cost of retaining the Administrator is allocated among the pools operated by the General Partner, including the Partnership.  
  2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:   
 The accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes are unaudited but, in the opinion of the General Partner, include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership s financial condition at September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and changes in partners  capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements present the results for interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally
provided in annual financial statements. These financial statements should be read together with the financial statements and notes included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2015 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Due to the nature of commodity trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.     Use of Estimates . The preparation of financial
statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

  (Unaudited)       
   Profit Allocation . The General Partner and each limited partner share
in the profits and losses of the Partnership in proportion to the amount of Partnership interest owned by each, except that no limited partner is liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of its capital contributions and profits, if any,
net of distributions or redemptions and losses, if any.     Statement of Cash Flows.  The Partnership is not required
to provide a Statement of Cash Flows.     Partnership s Investment . The Partnership carries its investment in the
Master at fair value based on the Master s net asset value per Redeemable Unit as calculated by the Master. The valuation of the Master s investments including the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the investments held by
the Master are described in Note 5,  Fair Value Measurements.      Master s Investments . All commodity
interests of the Master, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on the trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as
described in Note 5,  Fair Value Measurements ) at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains
or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated and are determined using the first-in, first-out method. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account in the Master s Statements of
Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized gains or losses are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.  
  Master s Cash . The Master s cash includes cash denominated in foreign currencies of $14,171,620 (cost of
$14,165,903) and $15,762,494 (cost of $15,855,406) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  Income Taxes . Income taxes have not been listed as each partner is individually liable for the taxes, if any, on its
share of the Partnership s income and expenses. The General Partner concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Partnership s financial statements. The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state and local tax
returns. No income tax returns are currently under examination. The 2012 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. The General Partner does not believe that there are any uncertain tax
positions that require recognition of a tax liability.     Investment Company Status . Effective January 1, 2014,
the Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-08,   Financial Services   Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements   and based on the General
Partner s assessment, the Partnership has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its investments at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  
  Net Income (Loss) per Redeemable Unit . Net income (loss) per Redeemable Unit for each Class is calculated in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946,   Financial Services   Investment Companies.   See Note 3,    Financial Highlights.   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments . The carrying value of the assets and liabilities presented in the Statements of
Financial Condition that qualify as financial instruments under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 825   Financial Instruments ,  approximates the fair value due to the short term nature of such balances.
    Recent Accounting Pronouncement . In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities .  The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments for all entities that hold financial assets
or owe financial liabilities. One of the amendments in this update eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for
financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet or a description of changes in the methods and significant assumptions. Additionally, the update eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. Investment companies are specifically exempted from ASU 2016-01 s equity investment accounting provisions and will continue to follow the industry specific guidance
for investment accounting under Topic 946. For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. For other entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The General Partner is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Partnership s financial statements and related
disclosures.    There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnership s critical accounting policies as
reported in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   4. Trading Activities:   
 The Partnership was formed for the purpose of trading commodity interests, including derivative financial instruments and
derivative commodity instruments. The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets through a  master/feeder  structure. The Partnership s pro-rata share of the results of the Master s trading activities are shown in the
Partnership s Statements of Income and Expenses.    The futures brokerage account agreements with MS Co. give the
Partnership and the Master the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward contracts. The Master nets, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward contracts in its
Statements of Financial Condition as the criteria under ASC 210-20,   Balance Sheet,   have been met.  
 Trading and transaction fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor for the Master and the
Partnership s percentage ownership of the Master. All clearing fees paid to MS Co. are borne by the Master and allocated to the Master s limited partners, including the Partnership.  
 All of the commodity interests owned by the Master are held for trading purposes. The monthly average number of futures
contracts traded by the Master during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 35,788 and 52,222, respectively. The monthly average number of futures contracts traded by the Master during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was 35,813 and 49,766, respectively. The monthly average number of metals forward contracts traded by the Master during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 805 and 858, respectively. The monthly average number
of metals forward contracts traded by the Master during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 814 and 1,089, respectively. The monthly average notional value of currency forward contracts traded by the Master during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $546,944,145 and $716,061,751, respectively. The monthly average notional value of currency forward contracts traded by the Master during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$584,321,971 and $629,061,981, respectively.

  The following tables summarize the gross and net amounts recognized relating
to assets and liabilities of the Master s derivatives and their offsetting subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

* 
   In the event of default by the Master, MS Co., the Master s commodity futures broker and the sole
counterparty to the Master s off-exchange-traded contracts, as applicable, has the right to offset the Master s obligation with the Master s cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills held by MS Co., thereby minimizing MS Co. s risk
of loss. There is no collateral posted by MS Co. and as such, in the event of default by MS Co., the Master is exposed to the amount shown in the Master s Statements of Financial Condition. In the case of exchange-traded contracts, the
Master s exposure to counterparty risk may be reduced since the exchange s clearinghouse interposes its credit between buyer and seller and the clearinghouse s guarantee fund may be available in the event of a default.

   5. Fair Value Measurements:   
  Master s Fair Value Measurements . Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.    The fair value of
exchange-traded futures and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign
currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign
currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as input the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately
3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.  
 The Master considers prices for exchange-traded commodity futures and forward contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1). The values of U.S. Treasury bills and non-exchange-traded forward contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are priced by broker quotes or pricing
services that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Master did not hold any
derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of the General Partner s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3). Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of
the reporting period. During the reporting periods, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.

   6. Financial Instrument Risks:   
 In the normal course of business, the Partnership, through its investment in the Master, is party to financial instruments
with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include futures, forwards, options and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or
reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments,
to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange, a swap execution facility or over-the-counter ( OTC ). Exchange-traded
instruments include futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may also be traded on a swap execution facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain
forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer or seller of an
option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instrument, including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than
those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. The General Partner estimates that, at any given time, approximately 20.7% to 27.1% of the Master s contracts are
traded OTC.     Futures Contracts . The Master trades futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy
or sell a specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or if the delivery quantity is
something where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S P 500 Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments ( variation margin ) may be made or received by the Master each business day, depending on the daily
fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Master. When the contract is closed, the Master records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at
the time it was opened and its value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly
with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners 
Capital.     Forward Foreign Currency Contracts . Forward foreign currency contracts are those contracts where the
Master agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Master s net equity therein, representing unrealized
gain or loss on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date, is included in the Master s Statements of Financial
Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on forward foreign currency contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively, and are included in the
Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners  Capital.     London Metals Exchange Forward
Contracts . Metal contracts traded on the London Metals Exchange ( LME ) represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin or zinc. LME contracts traded by the Master are cash settled
based on prompt dates published by the LME. Variation margin may be made or received by the Master each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the
Master. A contract is considered offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the prompt date, the Master records a realized gain or loss
equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and its value at the time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and
variation margin deposits, through the broker, directly with the LME. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are included in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in
Partners  Capital.    The Master does not isolate the portion of the results of operations arising from the effect of
changes in foreign exchange rates on investments due to fluctuations from changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in total trading results in the Master s Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in
Partners  Capital.

  (Unaudited)       
  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial
instruments traded by the Master due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which
the related underlying assets are traded. The Master is exposed to market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of
a contract. The Partnership s/Master s risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts
of the instruments. The Partnership s/Master s risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Master to offset unrealized gains and losses and other
assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Master has credit risk and concentration risk, as MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate is the sole counterparty or broker with respect to the
Partnership s/Master s assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate, the Partnership s/Master s counterparty is an exchange or
clearing organization.    The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership s/Master s risk
exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Master may be
subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account
analysis of futures and forward contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions.  
 The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the
Partnership s net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a consequence of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.  
 The majority of these financial instruments mature within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the
Partnership s/Master s business, these instruments may not be held to maturity.     7. Subsequent Events:   
 The General Partner evaluates events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The
General Partner has assessed the subsequent events through the date of issuance and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations      Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. The Partnership s only assets are its investment in the
Master and cash. The Master does not engage in sales of goods or services. The Master s only assets are its cash at bank and equity in trading account, consisting of cash at MS Co., cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures
contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity trading, relatively small price movements may
result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its investment in the Master. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the third quarter of 2016.  
 The Partnership s capital consists of capital contributions, as increased or decreased by income (loss) from its
investment in the Master, expenses, interest income, subscriptions, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Partnership capital increased 4.4% from $225,699,151 to $235,540,069. This
increase was attributable to subscriptions for 15,736.0000 Redeemable Units of Class A totaling $21,766,764, subscriptions for 39.8320 Redeemable Units of Class Z totaling $50,906 and net income of $3,561,558. This increase was partially offset
by redemptions of 11,031.1810 Redeemable Units of Class A totaling $15,353,547 and redemptions of 141.4930 Redeemable Units of Class D totaling $184,763.  
 The Master s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses
on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of units and distributions of profits, if any.    For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Master s capital decreased 10.3% from $603,041,370 to $540,650,533. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 30,365.5021 units totaling $117,748,172 and distributions of interest income to
feeder funds totaling $167,010. This decrease was partially offset by subscriptions of 6,528.5151 units totaling $25,278,283 and net income of $30,246,062. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in commodity
contract positions in subsequent periods.     Critical Accounting Policies   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The General Partner
believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2,
 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  of the Financial Statements.    The
Partnership records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts in the
Statements of Income and Expenses.

   Results of Operations   
 During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 2.9%
from $1,411.78 to $1,370.80, as compared to an increase of 2.5% in the third quarter of 2015. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class D decreased 2.6% from $1,335.66 to $1,300.96, as
compared to an increase of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2015. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 2.4% from $1,360.92 to $1,328.05, as compared to an increase of 3.0% in
the third quarter of 2015. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2016 of $4,323,082. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of
commodity futures in energy, grains, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock and metals, and were partially offset by gains in currencies, indices and softs. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading gain
before fees and expenses in the third quarter of 2015 of $8,191,347. Gains were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in energy, non-U.S. interest rates, livestock, metals and softs, and were partially offset by
losses in currencies, grains, indices and U.S. interest rates.    The most significant losses were incurred within the
energy complex during August and September from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices increased as the OPEC nations reached an agreement to potentially curtail oil production. Within the global interest rate sector, losses
were recorded during August and September from long positions in U.S. fixed income futures as prices trended lower amid uncertainty over the potential for the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank to increase interest rates at its September meeting. Additional
losses within the global interest rate sector were experienced from positions in Japanese fixed income futures during August. Losses within the metals markets were recorded primarily during August from long positions in gold and silver futures as
prices fell as a strengthening U.S. dollar diminished investor demand for precious metals. Within the agricultural markets, losses were incurred during July from long positions in soybean and soybean meal futures as prices were weighed down by
mounting anticipation that growers will collect a record crop this year. A portion of the Partnership s losses for the quarter was offset by gains achieved within the global stock index sector during July from long positions in U.S. equity
index futures as prices were buoyed by strong U.S. jobs data and improving investor sentiment. Smaller gains in this sector were also recorded during August and September. Additional gains were recorded within the currency sector during September
from long positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the yen rallied amid uncertainty surrounding global central bank activity and its consequential effects on the marketplace.  
 During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for
Class A increased 1.5% from $1,351.03 to $1,370.80, as compared to a decrease of 1.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable
Unit for Class D increased 2.4% from $1,270.21 to $1,300.96, as compared to a decrease of 1.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value per
Redeemable Unit for Class Z increased 3.0% from $1,289.37 to $1,328.05, as compared to a decrease of 0.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading gain before
fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $11,711,379. Gains were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in currencies, U.S and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock and softs, and were
partially offset by losses in energy, grains, indices and metals. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $6,409,489. Gains
were primarily attributable to the Master s trading of commodity futures in energy, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock, metals and softs, and were partially offset by losses in currencies, grains and indices.  
 The most significant gains were achieved within the global interest rate markets during January and February from long
positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices advanced after weakness in Chinese economic data revived concern about the stability of the global economy. Additional gains were experienced during June from long positions in European
and U.S. fixed income futures amid increased demand for stable assets as global risk assets roiled surrounding the U.K. Referendum vote. Within the currency sector, gains were recorded during June and September from long positions in the Japanese
yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the Asian currency rallied amid increased investor demand for  safe-haven  assets. Gains within the currency markets were also experienced during April from long positions in the Japanese
yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the dollar slid lower on the release of weaker-than-expected economic figures in the U.S. A portion of the Partnership s gains during the first nine months of the year was offset by losses
incurred within the metals markets during January and February from short positions in gold and silver futures as prices advanced after a weakening U.S. dollar reignited demand for the precious metals. Additional losses within the metals sector were
experienced during August from long positions in gold and silver futures as prices moved lower as investors weighed the potential for interest rate increases in the U.S. Within the global stock index sector, losses were recorded during March from
short positions in Asian and European equity index futures as rising commodity prices buoyed global stocks. Losses within the global stock index markets were also recorded during June from positions in U.S and European equity index futures. Within
the energy complex, losses were incurred during March and April from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices surged as U.S. oil rig counts continued to decline. Additional losses in the energies were experienced during August
and September from short positions in crude oil and its related products. Within the agricultural sector, losses were recorded during March and April from short positions in corn, wheat, and soybean futures as adverse weather conditions in South
America threatened Brazilian and Argentinian grain harvests.

  Commodity markets are highly volatile. The potential for broad and rapid price
fluctuations increases the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increases the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership (and the Master) depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisor to
correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international
political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisor is able to identify them, the Partnership (and the Master) expects to increase capital through operations.  
 Interest income on 80% of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s (or the Partnership s
allocable portion of the Master s) brokerage account during each month is earned at the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. Any interest earned on the Partnership s and/or the Master s account in excess of
the amounts described above, if any, will be retained by MS Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. All interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities will be retained by the Partnership and/or the
Master, as applicable. Interest income allocated from the Master for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $149,952 and $410,141, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in interest
income is primarily due to higher 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rates along with additional interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods
in 2015. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends upon (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s
and/or the Master s account, (2) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and/or the Master and (3) interest rates over which none of the Partnership, the Master or
MS Co. has control.    Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net
asset value per Class as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $101,225 and $221,989, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in ongoing selling agent fees is due to higher average net assets per Class
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  
 Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value of Class A and Class D
as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased by $78,652 and $180,615, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in management fees is due to higher average net assets of Class A and Class D during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.    General Partner fees are
paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership including, among other things, (i) selecting, appointing and terminating the Partnership s commodity trading advisor and (ii) monitoring the
activities of the commodity trading advisor. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net asset value per Class as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions.
Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. General Partner fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $52,436 and $120,410, respectively, as compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in General Partner fees is due to higher average net assets per Class during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  
 Incentive fees paid by the Partnership are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor at the end of the
quarter, as defined in the management agreement among the Partnership, the General Partner and the Advisor. Incentive fees borne by the Partnership for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0. Incentive fees for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0 and $3,535,100, respectively. The Advisor will not be paid incentive fees until the Advisor recovers the net loss incurred and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership.  
 In allocating substantially all of the assets of the Partnership to the Master, the General Partner considers, among other
things, the Advisor s past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any
time.

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 All or substantially all of the Partnership s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investment in
the Master. The Partnership and the Master are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the Master are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Master s assets are subject of
the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Master s and the Partnership s main line of business.  
 The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment.  
 Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Master s open positions and, consequently, in its
earnings and cash flow. The Master s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the
diversification effects among the Master s open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.    The
Master rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Master s past
performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.     Value at Risk  is a measure of the maximum
amount which the Master could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Master s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Master of market movements far
exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Master s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing as well as the risks and
uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Master s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value
at Risk or by the Master s attempts to manage its market risk.    Exchange margin requirements have been used by the
Master as the measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The margin
levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a
probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.    Value at Risk tables represent a
probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market sensitive instruments. The following tables indicate the trading Value at Risk associated with the Master s open positions by market category as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, and the highest, lowest and average values during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. All open position trading risk exposures of the Master have been
included in calculating the figures set forth below. There has been no material change in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Master s total capitalization was $540,650,533 and the Partnership owned approximately
44.1% of the Master. The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in the Master. The Master s Value at Risk as of September 30, 2016 was as follows:

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
 The Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and
Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.  
 The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining
and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnership s external disclosures.    The General
Partner s President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016 and, based on that
evaluation, the General Partner s President and CFO have concluded that, at that date, the Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
 The Partnership s  internal control over financial reporting  is a process under the supervision of the General
Partner s President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that:  

pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership;         

provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) the Partnership s receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and     

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.     
 There were no changes in the Partnership s  internal control over financial reporting  process during the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 This section describes the major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business,
to which MS Co. or its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject. There are no material legal proceedings pending against the Partnership or the General Partner.  
 On June 1, 2011, Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited
liability company. As a result of that conversion, Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated is now named Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ( MS Co. ).  
 MS Co. is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a Delaware holding company. Morgan Stanley files periodic
reports with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act, which include current descriptions of material litigation and material proceedings and investigations, if any, by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations
concerning Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries, including MS Co. As a consolidated subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, MS Co. does not file its own periodic reports with the SEC that contain descriptions of material litigation, proceedings and
investigations. As a result, please refer to the  Legal Proceedings  section of Morgan Stanley s SEC 10-K filings for 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011. In addition, MS Co. annually prepares an Audited, Consolidated Statement of
Financial Condition ( Audited Financial Statement ) that is publicly available on Morgan Stanley s website at  www.morganstanley.com . Please refer to the Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies   Legal section of
MS Co. s 2015 Audited Financial Statement.    In addition to the matters described in those filings, in the normal
course of business, each of Morgan Stanley and MS Co. has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global
diversified financial services institution. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Each of Morgan Stanley and MS Co. is also involved, from
time to time, in investigations and proceedings by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, fines or penalties. The number of these investigations and proceedings has
increased in recent years with regard to many financial services institutions, including Morgan Stanley and MS Co.  
 MS Co. is a Delaware limited liability company with its main business office located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York
10036. Among other registrations and memberships, MS Co. is registered as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association.  
   Regulatory and Governmental Matters         
 MS Co. has received subpoenas and requests for information from certain federal and state regulatory and governmental
entities, including among others various members of the RMBS Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, such as the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and several state Attorney General s Offices, concerning
the origination, financing, purchase, securitization and servicing of subprime and non-subprime residential mortgages and related matters such as residential mortgage-backed securities ( RMBS ), collateralized debt obligations
( CDOs ), structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) and credit default swaps backed by or referencing mortgage pass-through certificates. These matters, some of which are in advanced stages, include, but are not limited to,
investigations related to MS Co. s due diligence on the loans that it purchased for securitization, MS Co. s communications with ratings agencies, MS Co. s disclosures to investors, and MS Co. s handling of
servicing and foreclosure related issues.    On February 25, 2015, MS Co. reached an agreement in principle with
the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and the United States Attorney s Office for the Northern District of California, Civil Division (collectively, the  Civil Division ) to pay $2.6 billion to resolve certain claims
that the Civil Division indicated it intended to bring against MS Co. That settlement was finalized on February 10, 2016.

  On April 1, 2016, the California Attorney General s Office filed an
action against MS Co. and certain affiliates in California state court styled  California v. Morgan Stanley, et al. , on behalf of California investors, including the California Public Employees  Retirement System and the California
Teachers  Retirement System. The complaint alleges that MS Co. made misrepresentations and omissions regarding residential mortgage-backed securities and notes issued by the Cheyne SIV (defined below), and asserts violations of the
California False Claims Act and other state laws and seeks treble damages, civil penalties, disgorgement, and injunctive relief. On July 20, 2016, MS Co. filed a demurrer, which was granted on September 30, 2016. On October 21,
2016, the California Attorney General filed an amended complaint.    In October 2014, the Illinois Attorney
General s Office ( ILAG ) sent a letter to MS Co. alleging that MS Co. knowingly made misrepresentations related to RMBS purchased by certain pension funds affiliated with the State of Illinois and demanding that MS Co.
pay ILAG approximately $88 million. MS Co. and ILAG reached an agreement to resolve the matter on February 10, 2016.  
 On January 13, 2015, the New York Attorney General s Office ( NYAG ), which is also a member of the RMBS
Working Group, indicated that it intended to file a lawsuit related to approximately 30 subprime securitizations sponsored by MS Co. NYAG indicated that the lawsuit would allege that MS Co. misrepresented or omitted material information
related to the due diligence, underwriting and valuation of the loans in the securitizations and the properties securing them and indicated that its lawsuit would be brought under the Martin Act. MS Co. and NYAG reached an agreement to resolve
the matter on February 10, 2016.    On June 5, 2012, MS Co. consented to and became the subject of an Order
Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) to resolve allegations related to
the failure of a salesperson to comply with exchange rules that prohibit off-exchange futures transactions unless there is an Exchange for Related Position ( EFRP ). Specifically, the CFTC found that from April 2008 through October 2009,
MS Co. violated Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulation 1.38 by executing, processing and reporting numerous off-exchange futures trades to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) and Chicago Board of Trade
( CBOT ) as EFRPs in violation of CME and CBOT rules because those trades lacked the corresponding and related cash, OTC swap, OTC option, or other OTC derivative position. In addition, the CFTC found that MS Co. violated CFTC
Regulation 166.3 by failing to supervise the handling of the trades at issue and failing to have adequate policies and procedures designed to detect and deter the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations. Without admitting or
denying the underlying allegations and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS Co. accepted and consented to entry of findings and the imposition of a cease and desist order, a fine of $5,000,000, and undertakings related to public
statements, cooperation and payment of the fine. MS Co. entered into corresponding and related settlements with the CME and CBOT in which the CME found that MS Co. violated CME Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS Co. $750,000 and CBOT found
that MS Co. violated CBOT Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS Co. $1,000,000.    On July 23, 2014, the SEC
approved a settlement by MS Co. and certain affiliates to resolve an investigation related to certain subprime RMBS transactions sponsored and underwritten by those entities in 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, MS Co. and certain
affiliates were charged with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, agreed to pay disgorgement and penalties in an amount of $275 million and neither admitted nor denied the SEC s findings.  
 On April 21, 2015, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated ( CBOE ) and the CBOE Futures Exchange, LLC
( CFE ) filed statements of charges against MS Co. in connection with trading by one of MS Co. s former traders of EEM options contracts that allegedly disrupted the final settlement price of the November 2012 VXEM
futures. CBOE alleged that MS Co. violated CBOE Rules 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. CFE alleged that MS Co. violated CFE Rules 608, 609 and 620. The matters were
resolved on June 28, 2016 without any findings of fraud.

  On June 18, 2015, MS Co. entered into a settlement with the SEC and paid
a fine of $500,000 as part of the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative to resolve allegations that MS Co. failed to form a reasonable basis through adequate due diligence for believing the truthfulness of the assertions by
issuers and/or obligors regarding their compliance with previous continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act in connection with offerings in which MS Co. acted as senior or sole underwriter. 
 On August 6, 2015, MS Co. consented to and became the subject of an order by the CFTC to resolve allegations that
MS Co. violated CFTC Regulation 22.9(a) by failing to hold sufficient U.S. dollars in cleared swap segregated accounts in the United States to meet all U.S. dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. Specifically, the CFTC found that while
MS Co. at all times held sufficient funds in segregation to cover its obligations to its customers, on certain days during 2013 and 2014, it held currencies, such as euros, instead of U.S. dollars, to meet its U.S. dollar obligations. In
addition, the CFTC found that MS Co. violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to have in place adequate procedures to ensure that it complied with CFTC Regulation 22.9(a). Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions and
without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS Co. accepted and consented to the entry of findings, the imposition of a cease and desist order, a civil monetary penalty of $300,000, and undertakings related to public statements,
cooperation, and payment of the monetary penalty.      Civil Litigation    
 On December 23, 2009, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle filed a complaint against MS Co. and another
defendant in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, styled  Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Morgan Stanley   Co. Inc., et al.  The amended complaint, filed on September 28, 2010, alleges that defendants made
untrue statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by
MS Co. was approximately $233 million. The complaint raises claims under the Washington State Securities Act and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such certificates. By orders dated June
23, 2011 and July 18, 2011, the court denied defendants  omnibus motion to dismiss plaintiff s amended complaint and on August 15, 2011, the court denied MS Co. s individual motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. On March 7, 2013, the court granted defendants  motion to strike plaintiff s demand for a jury trial. The defendants  joint motions for partial summary judgment were denied on November 9, 2015. At
September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in this action was approximately $43 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred actual losses. Based on currently available information,
MS Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference between the $43 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS Co., plus pre-
and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.  
 On March 15, 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco filed a complaint against MS Co. and other defendants
in the Superior Court of the State of California styled  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. et al.  An amended complaint, filed on June 10, 2010, alleges that defendants made untrue
statements and material omissions in connection with the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The amount of certificates allegedly sold to
plaintiff by MS Co. was approximately $276 million. The complaint raises claims under both the federal securities laws and California law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such
certificates. On August 11, 2011, plaintiff s federal securities law claims were dismissed with prejudice. On February 9, 2012, defendants  demurrers with respect to all other claims were overruled. On December 20,
2013, plaintiff s negligent misrepresentation claims were dismissed with prejudice. At September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in these cases was approximately $52 million, and the
certificates had incurred actual losses of approximately $2 million. Based on currently available information, MS Co. believes it could incur a loss for this action up to the difference between the $55 million unpaid balance of these
certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS Co., or upon sale, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these
losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.

a complaint against MS Co., styled  China Development Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley   Co. Incorporated et al ., which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County ( Supreme Court of NY ).
The complaint relates to a $275 million credit default swap referencing the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that

loans and asserts claims under Illinois law. The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by MS Co. at issue in the action was approximately $203 million. The complaint seeks, among other things, to
rescind the plaintiff s purchase of such certificates. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the corrected amended complaint on May 27, 2011, which was denied on September 19, 2012. On December 13, 2013, the court entered

 On April 20, 2011, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston filed a complaint against MS Co. and other defendants in the
Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts styled  Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston v. Ally Financial, Inc. F/K/A GMAC LLC et al.  An amended complaint was filed on June 29, 2012 and alleges that defendants made untrue statements
and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS Co. or sold to plaintiff
by MS Co. was approximately $385 million. The amended complaint raises claims under the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act and common law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff s
purchase of such certificates. On May 26, 2011, defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The defendants  motions to dismiss the amended complaint were granted in part and denied in
part on September 30, 2013. On November 25, 2013, July 16, 2014, and May 19, 2015, respectively, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against MS Co. with respect to three of the securitizations at issue. After these
voluntary dismissals, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS Co. was approximately $332 million. At September 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through
certificates at issue in this action was approximately $52 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred actual losses. Based on currently available information, MS Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference

     Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in the
Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and under Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in the Partnership s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
2016 and June 30, 2016.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were subscriptions for 840.6910 Redeemable Units of Class A
totaling $1,186,721. The Redeemable Units were issued in reliance upon applicable exemptions from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The
Redeemable Units were purchased by accredited investors as defined in Regulation D. In determining the applicability of the exemption, the General Partner relied on the fact that the Redeemable Units were purchased by accredited investors in a
private offering.    Proceeds from the sale of Redeemable Units are used for the trading of commodity interests, including
futures and forward contracts.    The following chart sets forth the purchases of Redeemable Units for each class by the
Partnership.      

* 
   Generally, limited partners are permitted to redeem their Redeemable Units as of the end of each month on
three business days  notice to the General Partner. Under certain circumstances, the General Partner can compel redemption, although to date the General Partner has not exercised this right. Purchases of Redeemable Units by the Partnership
reflected in the chart above were made in the ordinary course of the Partnership s business in connection with effecting redemptions for limited partners.     

** 
   Redemptions of Redeemable Units are effected as of the end of each month at the net asset value per Redeemable
Unit as of that day. No fee will be charged for redemptions.          Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
   None.         Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures    Not applicable.
