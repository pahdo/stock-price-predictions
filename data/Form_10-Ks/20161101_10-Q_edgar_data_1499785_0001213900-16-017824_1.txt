   SEPTEMBER

   (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE
1 - Organization   

China
Herb Group Holdings Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated under the name  Island Radio, Inc  under
the laws of the State of Nevada on June 28, 2010  .  

On
June 27, 2012, Eric R. Boyer and Nina Edstrom (collectively, the  Sellers ), who were then the major shareholders
of the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Chin Yung Kong, Qiuping Lu and Fumin Feng (collectively, the  Purchasers ),
pursuant to which the Sellers sold to the Purchasers an aggregate 4,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, which represented
approximately 93% of the then total issued and outstanding stock of the Company, for a total purchase price of $159,970 (the  Change
in Control ). As result of this share purchase transaction, Chin Yung Kong, Qiuping Lu and Fumin Feng became the controlling
shareholders of the Company  .  

The
Company s original business plan was to become a commercial FM radio broadcaster. Subsequently, following the Change in
Control, the Company changed its business plan and intended to become a medical and spa company with a focus on Asia. However,
after consultation with its professional and business advisors in the United States and the People s Republic of China,
the Company s management decided during the third quarter of 2014 that this would no longer be its plan of operations. The
Company s plan of operations is to evaluate various industries, geographic and market opportunities. This may take the form
of acquiring a business, being acquired by an existing business or developing a business organically. Any such efforts may require
significant capital, which the Company currently lacks. There is no assurance that any such opportunity will become available.
There is also no assurance that, if any opportunity becomes available, the Company will have the financial and other resources
available to take advantage of such opportunity, since the Company s has extremely limited liquidity. Through September
30, 2016, the Company has no revenues or operation  .  

NOTE
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Unaudited
Interim Financial Information   

The
accompanying balance sheets as of September 30, 2016, statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and the statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. These unaudited
interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ). In the opinion of the Company s management, the unaudited interim financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and included all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation
of the Company s statement of financial position at September 30, 2016 and its results of operations and its cash flows
for the period ended September 30, 2016. The results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016  .  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for financial information and in accordance
with Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). They reflect all adjustments
which are, in the opinion of the Company s management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position as of
September 30, 2016 and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  

Use
of Estimates   

The
accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events,
the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful
judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates  .  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements  and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value  :  

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  .  

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data  .  

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities  .  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company believes that the recorded values of all of its financial instruments
approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations  .  

ASC
825-10  Financial Instruments , allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable,
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that
instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value
option to any outstanding instruments  .  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents  .  

Income
Taxes   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements
and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences
reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the
assets or liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified
as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized  .  

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10  Uncertainty in Income Taxes  (ASC 740-10). Certain recognition
thresholds must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue
to recognize tax positions that meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in the accompanying
financial statements  .  

Loss
per Share Calculation   

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding  .  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated
to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures  .  

NOTE
3 - Going Concern   

The
Company has minimal operations, and as such has devoted most of its efforts since its inception to developing its business plan,
issuing common stock, attempting to raise capital, establishing its accounting systems and other administrative functions  .  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any cash and has been funding its working capital needs from loans from related
parties. The Company is seeking sources of funding. Without limiting its available options, future equity financings will most
likely be through the sale of additional shares of its common stock. It is possible that the Company could also offer warrants,
options and/or rights in conjunction with any future issuances of its common stock. However, the Company can give no assurance
that financing will be available to it, and if available, in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company  .  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
State of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not established a source of
revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since its inception. Further, as
of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit and stockholders  deficit of $(343,975) and $(181,909), respectively.
These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments or classifications that may result from the possible inability of the Company
to continue as a going concern  .  

NOTE
4 - Related Party Transactions   

Related
Party Loans   

In
year 2013, Chin Yung Kong, the director and shareholder of the Company, advanced $20,000 to the Company for working capital purposes.
These working capital advances of $20,000 are payable on demand and, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, reflected as
related party loans on the accompanying balance sheets  .  

Starting
from year 2014, Qiuping Lu, President, CEO, director and shareholder of the Company, advanced funds to the Company for working
capital purposes. These working capital advances are payable on demand. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these
working capital advances amounted to $168,505 and $133,748, respectively, are reflected as related party loans on the accompanying
balance sheets  .  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, in connection with these related party loans, the Company imputed interest
of $3,634 and $2,866, respectively, and recorded interest expense and an increase in additional paid-in capital  .  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, in connection with these related party loans, the Company imputed interest
of $10,003 and $6,811, respectively, and recorded interest expense and an increase in additional paid-in capital  .

of $1,050.  

NOTE
6 - Commitments   

On
April 4, 2014 the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding (the  MOU ) with Dr. Kiril Pandelisev and Yan
Lawrence. Under the MOU, Dr. Pandelisev and Ms. Lawrence were to provide certain services to the Company and the Company was to
have issued 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock to each of Dr. Pandelisev and Ms. Lawrence
upon the completion of a reverse merger with a previously identified operating company, which reverse merger did not and will
not take place. Pursuant to ASC 505-50, the Company did not recognize any expense during the period since the issuance of these
shares is contingent upon the completion of a specific merger. Accordingly, no performance commitment has been reached nor has
performance been completed  .

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and
has determined there are no additional events required to be disclosed  .  

ITEM
2.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

We
have limited operations and are not currently generating any revenues from our business operations. Our independent registered
public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion for the year ended December 31, 2015. This means that our auditors believe
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months. We do not anticipate generating
significant revenues until we acquire a business, are acquired by an existing business or develop a business organically. Accordingly,
we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations  .  

We
presently are exploring other such sources of funding, including raising funds through a public offering, a private placement
of securities, debt or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely  .  

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes thereto and the other information
included in this Annual Report as filed with the SEC on Form 10-K  .  

Overview   

Our
original business plan was to become a commercial FM radio broadcaster. Subsequently, following a change in control, we changed
our business plan and intended to become a medical and spa company with a focus on Asia. However, after consultation with our
professional and business advisors in the United States and the People s Republic of China, management decided during the
third quarter of 2014 that this would no longer be our plan of operations. Our plan of operations is to evaluate various industries,
and geographic and market opportunities. This may take the form of acquiring a business, being acquired by an existing business
or developing a business organically. Any such efforts may require significant capital, which we currently lack. There is no assurance
that any such opportunity will become available. There is also no assurance that, if any opportunity becomes available, we will
have the financial and other resources available to take advantage of such opportunity, since we have extremely limited liquidity.
Through September 30, 2016, we had no revenues or operations.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues .
As of September 30, 2016, we had not generated any revenues.  

Operating
Expenses . For  the three months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses amounted
to $11,450 as compared to $10,365 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,085 or 10.5%. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses amounted to $26,666 as compared to $51,795 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $25,129 or 48.5%. Since inception, our operating expenses primarily consisted of fees
and expenses related to complying with our ongoing SEC reporting requirements, which have primarily consisted of legal fees, accounting
fees, transfer agent fees, filing fees, OTC markets listing fees, and consulting fees .  

Other
expenses .  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $3,634
and $2,866, respectively, in imputed interest expense related to advances outstanding to related parties. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $10,003 and $6,811, respectively, in imputed interest expense related to advances
outstanding to related parties. These imputed interests were recorded in our financial statements under additional paid-in capital .  

Net
Loss . Dur ing the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of
$15,084 and $13,231, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $36,669 and
$58,606,  respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of
September 30, 2016, we did not have any cash and had prepaid expenses of $7,792, had liabilities of $189,701, and had a working
capital deficit of $181,909. We expect to incur continued losses during the remainder of 2016, possibly even longer until we commence
operations and those operations are profitable  .  

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $37,638 and $56,908, respectively.
We expect to require working capital of approximately $50,000 over the next 12 months to meet our financial obligations  .  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $35,843 and $57,871,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received cash from bank drafts of $36, proceeds from sale of common
stock of $1,050 and proceeds from loans from officer of $34,757 for working capital purposes  .
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds from loans from officer
of $57,871 for working capital purposes .  

We have
not generated any revenues from operations to date. It is not likely that we will generate any revenue until at least a business
combination has been consummated. Even following a business combination, there is no guarantee that any revenues will be generated
or that any revenues will be sufficient to meet our expenses. We may consider a business combination with a target company which
itself has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop one or more new products or services, or is an established business which may be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.  

Moreover,
any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development or growth, including businesses
without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business
and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business
combination with a target company in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor
to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target company, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess
all significant risks  .  

The
foregoing considerations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We are currently planning
on devoting the vast majority of our efforts to identifying, investigating and conducting due diligence on target companies; and
negotiating, structuring, documenting and consummating a business combination. Our long-term ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, complete a business combination and, thereafter, achieve
profitable operations  .  

We
believe that we will be able to meet these costs through cash on hand and additional amounts, as may be necessary, to be loaned
by or invested in us by our stockholders, management and/or others. Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations
and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Our ability to continue as a going
concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a business combination.  Management s
plan includes obtaining additional funds through a combination of sales of our equity securities before, contemporaneously with,
or following, the consummation of a business combination; and borrowings, although we do not believe that we will be eligible
to borrow funds from a bank until at least a business combination is consummated.  However, here is no assurance that any
additional funding will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all  .  

We
currently rely on loans from our sole director and officer, Qiuping Lu, to meet our expenses. There is no guarantee that Ms. Lu
will continue to lend us funds to meet our expenses in the future. Currently, we do not have any other arrangements for financing.
 We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is
not available to us on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to develop operations or meet our expenses.  Additionally,
any equity financing in which we might engage would result in dilution to our existing shareholders.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Ms. Lu, the sole director and officer of us, advanced an aggregate $34,757
and $57,871, respectively, to us to pay some of our expenses and for working capital purposes. These advances in the aggregate
amounts of $168,505 and $133,748, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are payable on demand and are reflected
as related party loans on the accompanying balance sheets  .  

Imputed
interest of $3,634 and $2,866 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the imputed
interest was recorded as interest expense and an increase in additional paid-in capital, respectively  .  Imputed
interest of $10,003 and $6,811 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the imputed
interest was recorded as interest expense and an increase in additional paid-in capital, respectively .  

Going
Concern Consideration   

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated March 30, 2016, which
can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. This means that our auditors believe there
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months. Our financial statements found within
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the aforementioned Annual Report on Form 10-K contain additional note disclosures describing
the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.  

Contractual
Obligations   

On
April 4, 2014, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (the  MOU ) with two business consultants. Under the
MOU, the consultants were to provide certain services to the Company and the Company was to have issued 10% of the issued and
outstanding shares of our common stock to each consultant upon the completion of a reverse merger with a previously identified
operating company, which reverse merger did not and will not take place. Pursuant to ASC 505-50, we did not recognize any expense
during the period since the issuance of these shares of common stock was contingent upon the completion of a specific merger.
Accordingly, no performance commitment has been reached nor has performance been completed  .      

As
of September 30, 2016, we had no contractual obligations.  

Off
 Balance Sheet Operations   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet activities or operations.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(US GAAP) for financial information and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation S-X.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of the unaudited financial statements  .  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results may differ significantly
from those estimates  .  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no cash equivalents  .  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC
820,  Fair Value Measurements  and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value  :  

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  .  

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data  .  

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities  .  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we believe that the recorded values of all of our financial instruments approximate
their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations  .  

Net
Loss per Share Calculation   

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. During the periods presented, we had no dilutive
financial instruments issued or outstanding  .  

Income
Taxes   

We
account for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Under FASB ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and
financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification
of the assets and liabilities generating the differences  .  

We
maintain a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance based upon the potential
likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration our financial position and results of operations
for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within
the carry-forward period under the Federal tax laws  .  

Changes
in circumstances, such as us generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related
deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate  .  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncement   

Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. We do not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated
to have an impact on or are unrelated to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures  .  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
applicable.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
our chief executive officer and principal accounting officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)  .  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be presented or
detected on a timely basis  .  

Based
on management s assessment, we have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective in timely alerting management to the material information relating to us required to be included in our annual and
interim filings with the SEC  .  

Our
chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following
material weaknesses  :  

We
                                          were unable to maintain any segregation of duties
                                         within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance
                                         function.  While this control deficiency did not result in any audit adjustments
                                         to our 2015 interim or annual financial statements, it could have resulted in a material
                                         misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties ;    

We
                                          lack sufficient resources to perform the internal
                                         audit function and does not have an Audit Committee ;    

We
                                          do not have an independent Board of Directors,
                                         nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert.  The
                                         Board of Directors is comprised of one (1) member who is also our only executive officer.
                                          As a result, there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team, lack
                                         of independent review of our operating and financial results, and lack of independent
                                         review of disclosures made by us ; and    

Documentation
                                         of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.    

These
weaknesses were identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These weaknesses have existed
since our inception on June 28, 2010 and, as of September 30, 2016, have not been remedie  d.  

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited financial and personnel resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned
material weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following  :  

Consider
                                         t he engagement of consultants to assist in ensuring
                                         that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that
                                         we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures ;    

Hire
                                          additional qualified financial personnel, including
                                         a Chief Financial Officer, on a full-time  basis;    

Expand
                                          our board of directors to include additional independent
                                         individuals willing to perform directorial functions ; and    

Increase
                                         our workforce in preparation for commencing revenue producing operations.    

Since
the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel, these material weaknesses may not be overcome
in the near-term due to our limited financial resources.  Until such remedial actions can be realized, we will continue to
rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants  .  

Changes
in Controls and Procedures   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
