FINANCIAL REVIEW       T HE  PNC F INANCIAL  S ERVICES  G ROUP , I NC .       This Financial Review, including the Consolidated Financial Highlights, should be read together with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and unaudited Statistical Information included
elsewhere in this Report and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2015 Form 10-K). For information regarding certain business, regulatory and legal risks, see the following sections as they appear in this Report and in
our 2015 Form 10-K: the Risk Management section of the Financial Review portion of this report and of Item 7 in our 2015 Form 10-K; Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2015 Form 10-K; and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments and Guarantees Notes
of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K and our First and Second Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q. Also, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and the
Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgments section in this Financial Review and in our 2015 Form 10-K for certain other factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from
those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Report. See Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a reconciliation of total business
segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a GAAP basis.            
 Table 1: Consolidated Financial Highlights         

(a)  
  The Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review portions of the Financial Review section of this Report provide information regarding items impacting the
comparability of the periods presented.     

(b)  
  The effective income tax rates are generally lower than the statutory rate due to the relationship of pretax income to tax credits and earnings that are not subject to
tax.     

(c)  
  Calculated as annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or
partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $49 million and $50 million,
respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $145 million and $148 million, respectively. For additional information, see Statistical Information
(Unaudited) section in Item 1 of this Report.

(a)  
  The Executive Summary and Consolidated Balance Sheet Review portions of the Financial Review section of this Report provide information regarding items impacting the
comparability of the periods presented.     

(c)  
  Amounts include our equity interest in BlackRock.     

(d)  
  As a result of certain investment advisory services performed by one of our registered investment advisors, certain assets are reported as both discretionary client
assets under management and nondiscretionary client assets under administration. The amount of such assets was approximately $9 billion, $6 billion and $6 billion as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

(e)  
  Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during each period presented.     

(f)  
  See Basel III Capital discussion in the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review and the capital discussion in the
Banking Regulation and Supervision section of Item 1 Business in our 2015 Form 10-K. See also the Transitional Basel III and Pro forma Fully Phased-In Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios (Non-GAAP)   2015 Periods table in
the Statistical Information section of this Report for a reconciliation of the 2015 periods  ratios.     

(h)  
  The allowance for loan and lease losses includes impairment reserves attributable to purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or
guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans.     
      
   2     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

E XECUTIVE  S UMMARY     
  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.      We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential
mortgage banking, providing many of our products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North
Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally.        Key Strategic Goals        At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused
on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our
commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities where we do business.      We strive to expand and deepen customer
relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, fee-based and credit products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their financial objectives. Our strategies for
growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on putting customers  needs first. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers  financial goals and offering our diverse products
and services to help them achieve financial wellbeing. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures.      Our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. One of our priorities is to build a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated geographic markets. In addition, we are
seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. PNC is focused on redefining the retail banking experience by transforming the retail distribution network and the home lending process while lowering delivery costs as
customer banking preferences evolve. Additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while investing in technology to bolster critical business infrastructure and streamline core processes.   
  Our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions and the Basel
III framework and return excess

capital to shareholders, in accordance with the currently effective capital plan included in our Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submission to the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). For more detail, see the Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary, the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk
Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K.   
    Income Statement Highlights        Net
income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.0 billion, or $1.84 per diluted common share, a decrease of 6%, compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.90 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2015.   

Noninterest income increased $21 million, or 1%, to $1.7 billion as growth in fee income was mostly offset by a decline in other noninterest income.

Noninterest expense increased $42 million to $2.4 billion, reflecting a new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance surcharge
and higher costs associated with business activities as PNC continued to focus on disciplined expense management.          
 
  For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in this Financial Review.   
    Credit Quality Highlights     
  Overall credit quality remained relatively stable at September 30, 2016.   

For additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of the Consolidated Balance
Sheet Review of this Financial Review.   

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      3    

Balance Sheet and Liquidity Highlights     
  PNC s balance sheet continued to be well positioned at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.   

Total commercial lending grew $4.6 billion, or 3%.          

Total consumer lending decreased $.8 billion, or 1%.          

Capital Highlights        PNC maintained a strong capital position and continued to return capital to shareholders.       

In the third quarter of 2016, we returned $.8 billion of capital to common shareholders through repurchases of 5.9 million common shares for $.5
billion, made under new share repurchase programs, and dividends on common shares of $.3 billion.          

On October 4, 2016, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 55 cents per share effective with the November 5,
2016 payment date.         See the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and the Liquidity Risk Management
portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2016 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.      Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the
supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR

process. For additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K.      Our Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet Review sections of this Financial Review describe in greater detail our results during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 and balances
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.        Business Outlook     
  Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including our current view that the U.S. economy will grow moderately in the latter half of 2016, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving housing
activity and moderate job gains, and that short-term interest rates and bond yields will hold fairly steady before gradually rising late this year and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory
contingencies. Specifically, our business outlook reflects our expectation of a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December 2016. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2015 From 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.   
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect:       

Modest loan growth compared to the third quarter of 2016;      

Stable net interest income compared to the third quarter, and purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million;

Stable fee income compared to the third quarter of 2016, with fee income consisting of asset management, consumer services, corporate services,
residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;          

Provision for credit losses to be between $75 million and $125 million; and      

Noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis, compared to the third quarter 2016.      
  We also expect full year 2016 noninterest expense to remain stable compared to full year 2015, and the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be
approximately 25%.

Average Consolidated Balance Sheet Highlights     
      Table 2: Summarized Average Balance Sheet     

Average investment securities increased due to higher average agency residential mortgage-backed securities
and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by a decrease in average non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Total investment securities increased from 19% to 23% of average interest-earning assets.   
  The increase in average loans was driven by growth in average commercial real estate loans of $3.9 billion and average commercial loans of $1.7 billion,
partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $2.8 billion. The decline in consumer loans was primarily attributable to declines in the nonstrategic consumer and the government guaranteed education loan portfolios. Loans represented 66% of
average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2016 and 67% in the same period of 2015.      Average interest-earning deposits with
banks, which are primarily maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased in the comparison reflecting higher investment securities, loan growth and lower borrowed funds, partially offset by an increase in deposits.   
  Average total deposits increased $10.6 billion, primarily due to higher average savings deposits, which reflected a shift from money market deposits to
relationship-based savings products. Additionally, average interest-bearing demand deposits and average noninterest-bearing deposits increased as

overall deposits grew. Average total deposits increased from 67% to 69% of average assets in the comparison.      Average borrowed funds declined due to decreases in average commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average bank notes and senior debt. The
Liquidity Risk Management portion of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds.   
  Various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances, whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends
apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Total assets were $369.3 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $358.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review provides
information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at September 30, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015.

Recent Market and Industry Developments     
  As previously disclosed in our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q, the final rules adopted by the FDIC imposing a deposit insurance assessment surcharge
(Surcharge) on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (including PNC Bank) became effective on July 1, 2016. The Surcharge took effect beginning with the third quarter 2016 assessment period. Based
on data as of September 30, 2016, PNC Bank s quarterly assessment increased by approximately $25 million compared to the second quarter of 2016, reflecting the impact of the Surcharge and the reduction of regular assessments that went into
effect at the same time.     In September 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued final enforceable guidelines under
section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that establish standards for recovery planning for insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, including PNC Bank. The guidelines require a covered bank to
develop and maintain a recovery plan that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability should identified triggering events occur. For PNC Bank the
compliance date for these guidelines is January 1, 2018.      Also in September 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed amendments to its capital plan
rule that would, among other things, reduce, from 1% to 0.25% of Tier 1 capital, the amount of capital distributions that a bank holding company may make above the amounts included in its most recently approved capital plan without seeking the
Federal Reserve s prior approval and prohibit bank holding companies from seeking to use this  de minimis  capital distribution authority during the second calendar quarter of each year. The comment period on the proposal closes on
November 25, 2016. Governor Daniel Tarullo of the Federal Reserve also outlined additional changes that the Federal Reserve is considering to its capital plan rule and CCAR process, including the establishment of a new  stress capital
buffer,  in a speech delivered on September 26, 2016. Governor Tarullo indicated that such potential changes would be issued for public comment at a later date and, accordingly, the precise nature of these additional potential changes is not
known at this time.   
 
      C ONSOLIDATED  I NCOME  S TATEMENT 
R EVIEW        Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.   
  Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.0 billion, or $1.84 per diluted common share, a decrease of 6% compared with $1.1 billion, or $1.90 per
diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, net income was $2.9 billion, or $5.33 per diluted common share, a decrease of 6% compared with $3.1 billion, or $5.52 per diluted common share, for the first
nine months of 2015.      Net income decreased in the quarterly comparison as revenue growth, driven by a 2% increase in net interest income and a
1% increase in noninterest income, was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate and a 2% increase in noninterest expense. Net income decreased in the year-to-date comparison driven by higher provision for credit losses and a 3% decline in
noninterest income, partially offset by a 1% increase in net interest income and lower noninterest expense.        Net Interest Income
           Table 3: Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin     

(a)  
  See footnote (c) in Table 1: Consolidated Financial Highlights on page 1.        Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and
noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited)   Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information.   
  Net interest income increased by $33 million, or 2%, and $75 million, or 1%, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared
to the same periods in 2015. The increases in both comparisons were attributable to increases in loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion, lower securities yields and an increase in
borrowing costs.      Net interest margin increased in the quarterly comparison largely reflecting the impact of the December 2015 increase in the
federal funds rate and decreased in the year-to-date comparison as the impact of the rate increase was more than offset by a lower benefit from purchase accounting accretion.

Noninterest Income                
      Table 4: Noninterest Income         

Noninterest income increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 and
decreased in the first nine months compared to the same period in 2015. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% in both the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 and 45% and 46% on a year-to-date basis, respectively.   
  Asset management revenue increased in the quarterly comparison primarily due to the impact of higher average equity markets on both BlackRock and our
asset management business segment. The year-to-date comparison decreased mainly due to lower earnings from BlackRock and the impact from a $30 million trust settlement during the second quarter of 2015 in our asset management business segment.
Discretionary client assets under management were $138 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $132 billion at September 30, 2015.   
  Consumer services fees increased in the year-to-date comparison primarily due to growth in payment-related products including debit card, credit card and
merchant services, as well as higher brokerage fees.      Corporate services revenue increased in the year-to-date comparison primarily reflecting
higher capital markets-related revenue and higher treasury management fees.      Residential mortgage revenue increased in the quarterly
comparison as a result of higher loan sales revenue from higher origination volumes and increased benefit from residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The year-to-date comparison decreased mainly due to lower loan
sales revenue and a lower benefit from residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.      Other noninterest income
decreased in both comparisons primarily attributable to the impact of third quarter 2015 net gains of $43 million on sales of 0.5 million Visa Class B

common shares and lower revenue from private equity investments. There were no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter of 2016. Net gains on the sale of Visa shares for the first nine months of
2016 were $52 million on sales of 1.35 million shares compared with net gains of $124 million on sales of 1.5 million shares in the first nine months of 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to swap
agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all sales to date.        Provision For Credit Losses     
  The provision for credit losses increased modestly to $87 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $81 million in the third quarter of 2015 and
increased $185 million to $366 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the year-to-date comparison was attributable to a higher provision for energy related loans in the oil, gas, and coal
sectors of $130 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $86 million for the first nine months of 2015, as well as slowing credit quality improvement in our commercial and consumer lending portfolios and the impact of continued loan
growth.      The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding
factors impacting the provision for credit losses.        Noninterest Expense        Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 increased $42 million to $2.4 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015, while noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015 decreased $32 million to $7.0 billion. Both comparisons reflected increases to noninterest expense resulting from a new FDIC deposit insurance surcharge, higher variable compensation costs associated with increased business
activity and investments in technology and business infrastructure as PNC continued to

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      7    

focus on disciplined expense management. These were offset by net lower contingency accruals and the impact from our effective expense management.   
  As of September 30, 2016, we have completed actions to capture more than 75% of our 2016 continuous improvement savings goal of $400 million, and are on
track to achieve the full-year goal. Through this program, we are helping to fund our continued investments in technology and business infrastructure.

Effective Income Tax Rate        The effective income tax rate was 25.4% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 20.0% in the third quarter of 2015 and 24.4% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 24.3% in the same period of 2015.
The lower effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 reflected tax benefits attributable to effectively settling acquired entity tax contingencies.      The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits PNC receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in
other tax exempt investments.

      Table 5: Summarized Balance Sheet Data     

The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part 1, Item 1 of
this Report.      PNC s balance sheet reflected asset growth compared to December 31, 2015 and strong liquidity and capital positions at
September 30, 2016.   

Total assets increased primarily due to higher investment securities and loan balances, partially offset by lower interest-earning deposits with banks.

Higher total liabilities were driven by deposit growth.      

The increase to total equity reflected increased retained earnings driven by net income, partially offset by share repurchases.

Loan growth was the result of an increase in total commercial lending driven by higher commercial and
commercial real estate loans, while consumer lending declined due to lower home equity and education loans, partially offset by higher automobile and residential mortgage loans.      Loans represented 57% of total assets at September 30, 2016 and 58% at December 31, 2015. Commercial lending represented 66% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and 65% at December 31,
2015. Consumer lending represented 34% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and 35% at December 31, 2015. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding
our loan portfolio.   
 
   Total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $3.1 billion, or 1% of total loans, at September 30,

      Table 7: Purchased Impaired Loans   Balances     

The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to
as the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Activity for the accretable yield during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 follows:   
      Table 8: Purchased Impaired Loans   Accretable Yield     
   
    We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $3.9 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $2.8
billion carrying value at September 30, 2016 and accretable net interest of $1.1 billion.

Investment Securities        The following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator
of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities
portfolio.          Table 10: Investment Securities

  Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.     

(d)  
  Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities.     
    
   Investment securities represented 21% of total assets at September 30, 2016 and 20% at December 31, 2015.
     We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps
to improve our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. At September 30, 2016, 91% of the securities in the portfolio were rated AAA/AA, with U.S. Treasury and government agencies, agency residential
mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 71% of the portfolio.      The investment securities
portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between amortized cost and fair
value, included in Shareholders  equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.   
  The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of
investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and

vice versa. Net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.8 billion at September 30, 2016 from $.7 billion at December 31, 2015. The comparable amounts for the
securities available for sale portfolio were $1.3 billion at September 30, 2016 and $.5 billion at December 31, 2015.      Unrealized gains and
losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity; however, these gains and losses do affect capital under the regulatory capital rules. Also, a change in the securities  credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the
securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. In addition, the amount representing the
credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.      The
duration of investment securities was 1.8 years at September 30, 2016. We estimate that at September 30, 2016 the effective duration of investment securities was 2.0 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 1.6
years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 for the effective duration of investment securities were 2.8 years and 2.6 years, respectively.

Based on current interest rates and expected prepayment speeds, the weighed-average expected maturity of
the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and other) was 4.0 years at September 30, 2016 compared to 4.8 years at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average expected maturities of mortgage and other asset-backed debt
securities were as follows as of September 30, 2016:          Table 11: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of

    At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. If economic
conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the
valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement. For those securities on our balance sheet at September 30,
2016, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities.
The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower.

       Loans Held for Sale     
      Table 12: Loans Held For Sale         

    Loans held for sale increased in the comparison as origination volumes exceeded loan sales during the first nine months
of 2016 in both commercial and residential mortgages.

We sold $2.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans to agencies during the first nine months of 2016 compared
to $3.0 billion during the first nine months of 2015. Total revenue of $51 million was recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, during the first nine months of 2016, including $18 million
in the third quarter. Comparable amounts for 2015 were $64 million and $13 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.      Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $7.6 billion during the first nine months of 2016 compared to $8.2 billion in the same period in 2015. The majority of such loans were originated
under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $4.8 billion of loans and recognized loan sales revenue of $262 million during the first nine months of 2016, of which $103 million occurred in the third quarter. The comparable
amounts for 2015 were $6.2 billion and $278 million, respectively, including $75 million in the third quarter. These loan sales revenue amounts are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.   
  Interest income on loans held for sale was $55 million during the first nine months of 2016, including $21 million in the third quarter. Comparable
amounts for 2015 were $68 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for
additional information regarding our 2016 capital and liquidity activities.      Total deposits increased in the comparison mainly due to growth
in savings deposits reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   
  Total borrowed funds decreased in the comparison due to maturities of FHLB borrowings, partially offset by higher bank notes and senior debt.   
    Capital        We manage our funding
and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies
and retaining earnings.      We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under common stock repurchase authorizations approved by PNC s Board of
Directors and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal Reserve. The extent and timing of share repurchases under authorizations will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic
conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of future supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and
capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process.      In the second quarter of 2016, we completed our
common stock repurchase programs for the five quarter period that ended in June 2016 with total repurchases of 29.9 million common shares for $2.7 billion. These repurchases were included in our capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part
of our 2015 CCAR submission. Additionally, we paid $1.3 billion in common stock dividends for a total of $4.0 billion of capital returned to shareholders during this five quarter period.      In connection with the 2016 CCAR process, we submitted our capital plan as approved by PNC s Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in April 2016. The Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan
and did not object to our proposed capital actions. As provided for in the 2016 capital plan, PNC announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2016, including repurchases
of up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans. In the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for $.5 billion.

We paid dividends on common stock of $.3 billion, or 55 cents per common share, during the third quarter of
2016. On October 4, 2016, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of 55 cents per share payable on November 5, 2016. In July 2016, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend on common stock to 55 cents
per share, an increase of 4 cents per share, or 8%, effective with the August dividend.      See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1

  Par value less than $.5 million at each date.     
  The growth in total shareholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was mainly due to an increase in retained earnings
and higher accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to net securities gains, partially offset by common share repurchases of $1.5 billion. The growth in retained earnings resulted from net income of $2.9 billion during the period,
reduced by $1.0 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares outstanding were 488 million and 504 million at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, reflecting repurchases of 17.9 million shares during the
period.

Table 15: Basel III Capital     

(a)  
  Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2016.     

(b)  
  PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the
regulatory capital standards that will ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules. Pro forma fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and risk-weighted and leverage-related assets are estimates.     

(c)  
  Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced
approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC s models integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.     

(d)  
  Primarily includes REIT Preferred Securities for transitional and pro forma fully phased-in.     

(e)  
  Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.     

(f)  
  Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are estimated based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market, and operational
risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase PNC has refined the data, models, and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements to this
estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.     

(g)  
  Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures including undrawn credit commitments and derivative
potential future exposures.     

(h)  
  Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratio based on Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets and rules.     

(i)  
  For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimate is 11.2%. This capital ratio is
calculated using pro forma fully phased-in Common equity Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.

(j)  
  For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimate is 12.4%. This capital ratio is
calculated using fully phased-in Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.     

(k)  
  For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Total capital risk-based capital ratio estimate is 13.8%. This ratio is
calculated using fully phased-in Total Basel III capital, which under the advanced approaches, Additional Tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of Basel expected credit losses, if any, up to 0.6% of credit risk
related risk-weighted assets, and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approach risk-weighted assets.     

(l)  
  Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.     

(m)  
  Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure. As advanced approaches banking organizations, PNC and PNC
Bank will be subject to a 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio effective January 1, 2018.     
    
   As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules (Basel
III rules), as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC s regulatory risk-based ratios in 2016 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted
assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2016). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in
effect for 2016 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2016 Transitional Basel III ratios. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a
pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.   
  Under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage
servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the
institution s adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale,
as well as pension and other postretirement plans.      Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding
companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them
to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our September 30, 2016 capital levels were aligned with them.   
  At September 30, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered  well capitalized,  based on applicable U.S. regulatory
capital ratio requirements. To qualify as  well capitalized , PNC must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based

capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based
capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital, and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.     We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital
requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015
Form 10-K. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report for details on PNC s December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 Transitional Basel III and Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratios.

   Retail Banking earned $798 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $694 million for the
first nine months of 2015. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by increased provision for credit losses. Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer
experience with refinements to product offerings that drive product value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.
     Retail Banking continued to focus on the strategic priority of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch
network transformation and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.   

In the first nine months of 2016, approximately 57% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with
52% for the same period in 2015.      

Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 49% of total deposit transactions in the first nine months of 2016 compared with 43% for
the same period in 2015.      

Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer s debit card in minutes, was available in 1,812 branches, or 70% of the branch
network, as of September 30, 2016.

Net interest income increased in the comparison due to growth in deposit balances partially offset by lower
loan balances and interest rate spread compression on the value of loans.      The decline in noninterest income compared to the prior year period
reflected the impact of higher net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares in the 2015 period, as the first nine months of 2016 reflected net gains of $52 million on sales of 1.35 million Visa shares compared with net gains of $124 million on
the sale of 1.5 million shares for the same period in 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa shares in connection with all sales to date.   
  Excluding the impact of these Visa sales, noninterest income grew in the comparison, reflecting execution on our strategy to provide diverse product and
service offerings, which contributed to higher consumer service fee income from payment-related products, specifically in debit card, credit card and merchant services, as well as increased brokerage fees.   
  The decline in noninterest expense in the comparison was due to a decrease in compensation expense, lower marketing expense and reduced branch network
expenses as a result of network transformation and transaction migration to lower cost digital and ATM channels.      Provision for credit losses
increased compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting slowing credit quality improvement.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and
retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market specific deposit growth strategies, and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC.      In the first nine months of 2016, average total deposits increased compared to the same period a year ago, driven by growth in savings deposits reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to
relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand deposit categories increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.      Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy. The decrease in average total loans in the comparison was due to a decline in home equity and commercial loans, as well as
runoff of certain portions of the portfolios, as more fully described below.   

Average home equity loans decreased as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume. Retail Banking s home equity loan portfolio
is relationship based, with over 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The weighted-average updated FICO scores for this portfolio were 748 at September 30, 2016 and 752 at December 31, 2015.

Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.      

Average automobile loans, comprised of both direct and indirect auto loans, increased primarily due to portfolio growth in previously underpenetrated
markets.      

Average credit card balances increased as a result of efforts to increase credit card share of wallet through organic growth.

In the first nine months of 2016, average loan balances for the remainder of the portfolio declined $993 million, or 11%, compared to the same period
in 2015, driven by declines in the discontinued government guaranteed education, indirect other, and residential mortgage portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.         Nonperforming assets decreased compared to September 30, 2015 driven by declines in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans.

Corporate   Institutional Banking earned $1.5 billion in the first nine months of both 2016 and
2015. Earnings decreased by $34 million primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is
attractive, including in the Southeast.      Net interest income decreased in the comparison, driven by continued interest rate spread compression
on loans and lower purchase accounting accretion, which were mostly offset by the impact of higher average loans as well as interest rate spread expansion on deposits.      Higher noninterest income in the comparison was primarily due to an equity investment gain, an increase in gains on asset sales, higher capital markets-related revenue and higher treasury management fees.
These increases were partially offset by lower noninterest income from commercial mortgage loan servicing and commercial mortgage loans held for sale activities.      Overall credit quality for the first nine months of 2016 remained relatively stable, except for deterioration of certain energy related loans, which was the primary driver for the increase in provision
for credit losses, net charge-offs and nonperforming assets in the year over year comparisons. Increased provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of continued loan growth.      Noninterest expense increased in the comparison due to higher variable compensation and other costs associated with increased business activity and investments in technology and infrastructure, partially
offset by our continued expense management.   
 
   Average loans increased in the comparison due to strong growth in Real Estate, partially offset by a
decline in Corporate Banking:   

PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Higher average loans for
this business were primarily due to growth in commercial lending driven by higher term and REIT lending.      

Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations,
government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business declined in the comparison, reflecting the impact of capital and liquidity management activities, partially offset by increased lending to large corporate clients.

PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured
by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison due to new originations.      

PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and
finance leases, and operating leases were $11.8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, stable with the first nine months of 2015.         Average deposits increased nominally compared to the prior year period, as interest-bearing demand deposit growth was essentially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money
market deposits.      Growth in the commercial loan servicing portfolio was driven by servicing additions from new and existing customers
exceeding portfolio runoff.

Product Revenue       In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate   Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and
services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income.
From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate   Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other
Information section in Table 18 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.      Treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, increased in the comparison to the prior year period, driven by liquidity-related revenue.

Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan
syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services increased slightly in the comparison as higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and
structuring fees on asset securitizations were mostly offset by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities.      Revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities (including net interest income and noninterest income) includes those derived from commercial mortgage servicing and from commercial mortgage loans held
for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison due to lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale, partially offset by higher commercial mortgage loan servicing
income.

Asset Management Group earned $155 million through the first nine months of 2016 compared with $143 million
in the same period of 2015. Earnings for the first nine months of 2016 increased due to lower noninterest expense and a decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreased revenue.   
  The decrease in total revenue in the comparison was driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The
decline in noninterest income reflected the impact of a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015, which was partially offset by net business growth.      Noninterest expense decreased in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior year period, primarily attributable to lower personnel expense. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined
expense management as it makes strategic investments.     Asset Management Group s growth strategy is focused on capturing more investable
assets by delivering an enhanced client experience, and involves new client acquisition and expanding products and services based on our clients  needs and investment objectives while leveraging our open architecture platform with a full array
of investment products and banking solutions for all clients. Key considerations are maximizing front line productivity, a relationship-based focus with other line of business partners, and optimizing market presence in high opportunity markets.

Residential Mortgage Banking earned $46 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with earnings of
$43 million in the first nine months of 2015, primarily driven by a decline in noninterest expense, which was mostly offset by lower noninterest income and net interest income.     The strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions, competing on the basis of superior
service, and leveraging the bank footprint markets.      Residential Mortgage Banking overview:   

Total loan originations declined 7% compared to the same period in 2015. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs agency guidelines. Refinancings were 57% of originations in the first nine months of
2016 and 54% in the first nine months of 2015.          

The decline in net interest income was driven by the decrease in loan originations and lower balances of portfolio loans held for investment.

Noninterest income declined in the comparison, as increased servicing fee income was more than offset by lower benefit from residential mortgage
servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, and decreased loan sales revenue.          

Noninterest expense declined primarily as a result of lower residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses, including reserve releases of $24
million, as well as lower servicing costs.

  Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. This segment contained 82% of PNC s purchased impaired loans at both September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015.        This business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of
other companies. The business activity of this segment is to manage the liquidation of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.      Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio earned $135 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $205 million in the first nine months of 2015. Earnings decreased primarily due to a declining loan
portfolio and lower benefit from provision for credit losses in 2016.

Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio overview:   

Lower net interest income resulted from lower purchase accounting accretion and the impact of the declining average balance of the loan portfolio.

The reduced benefit from provision for credit losses was driven by higher releases of reserves in 2015.      

Noninterest expense declined in the comparison, driven by lower costs of managing and servicing the loan portfolios as the portfolio continues to
decline.      

Average portfolio loans decreased due to customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets. The decrease
also reflects the impact of our change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain purchased impaired loans.            C RITICAL  A CCOUNTING  E STIMATES   AND  J UDGMENTS     
  Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of
this Report describe the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or
conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.      The

    Recently Issued Accounting Standards         Revenue Recognition       In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance in U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize

revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures
relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.      In August 2015, the
FASB issued guidance deferring the mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. During 2016, the FASB has also issued three separate ASUs which amend the original standard
to clarify guidance regarding principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations and licensing, and certain narrow-scope amendments which address the presentation of sales tax, noncash consideration, contract modifications at
transition and assessing collectability.      The requirements within ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent amendments should be applied retrospectively
to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application (i.e., modified
retrospective application). We plan to adopt the ASU consistent with the deferred mandatory effective date using the modified retrospective approach. Based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a
significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.       Financial Instruments    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Equity
investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value
is not readily determinable. Additionally, the ASU changes the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value; and amends certain disclosure requirements relating to the fair value of financial
instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively. We plan to adopt all provisions consistent with the effective date and are currently evaluating the
impact of this ASU on our results of operations and financial position.

Leases       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842 ) . The primary change in the new guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases.
The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee
will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach through a
cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.       Credit Losses
      In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments . The ASU requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, expected credit losses for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. The expected
credit loss methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for
unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope of the ASU, except for purchased credit deteriorated assets, will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized
cost basis of the assets.      Enhanced credit quality disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by
vintage. The development of an expected credit loss methodology and new disclosures will require significant data collection, loss model upgrades, and process re-development prior to adoption. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim
periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is
effective. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.       Statement of Cash Flows       In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The ASU provides guidance on eight specific issues related to classification within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in
practice. The specific issues cover cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; cash outflows for settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are

insignificant; contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of
corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests received in securitization transactions; and clarifies that when no specific GAAP
guidance exists and the source of the cash flows are not separately identifiable, then the predominant source of cash flows should be used to determine the classification for the item. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods
within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We
are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.       Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

nine months of 2016.  

Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2016 increased modestly to $87 million compared to $81 million for the third quarter of
2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, provision for credit losses increased to $366 million compared with $181 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, the provision included $130
million for energy related loans in the oil, gas, and coal sectors compared to $86 million for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in provision also reflected slowing credit quality improvement in the commercial and consumer lending
portfolios and the impact of continued loan growth.      

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 decreased $50 million compared with December 31, 2015 due to declining home equity and residential real
estate nonperforming loans, and lower other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets, partially offset by higher nonperforming commercial loans driven by energy related loans. Nonperforming assets were 0.64% of total assets at September 30,
2016 compared with 0.68% at December 31, 2015.      

large part to a decrease in accruing government insured residential real estate and education past due loans of $117 million.      

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies        Nonperforming Assets, including OREO and Foreclosed Assets       Nonperforming assets include
nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale,
certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is
included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 23. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.   

Table 23: Nonperforming Assets By Type     

(a)  
  Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on
nonperforming status.     

(b)  
  Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired
loans.     

(c)  
  The recorded investment of loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $.4 billion and $.6 billion at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Both periods included $.3 billion of loans that are government insured/guaranteed.     
      
   30     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

Table 24: Change in Nonperforming Assets    
   
    As of September 30, 2016, approximately 84% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened
reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of September 30, 2016, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 66% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded
to date, before consideration of the ALLL.   
 
   Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 72% of total residential real
estate nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016, up from 68% at December 31, 2015. Home equity TDRs comprise 53% of home equity nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016, up from 51% at December 31, 2015. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming
status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7
bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.   
  At September 30, 2016, our largest nonperforming asset was $50 million in the Mining, Quarrying, Oil and Gas Extraction Industry and our average
nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. The ten largest individual nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represented 44% and 13% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and
total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of September 30, 2016.   

Table 25: OREO and Foreclosed Assets     
   
    Total OREO and foreclosed assets were 10% of total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016, compared to 12% at
December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, 61% of our OREO and foreclosed assets were comprised of residential related properties, compared to 59% at December 31, 2015.       Loan Delinquencies       We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these
levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan
delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.   
         The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      31    

Table 26: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)     

Total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased at September 30,
2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due primarily to reductions in consumer early stage delinquencies.      Accruing loans past due 90 days or more
decreased at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 driven by declines in government insured residential real estate and other consumer loans. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to
accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or
guaranteed loans.      On a regular basis our Special Asset Committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in
the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower s ability to comply with existing repayment terms. These loans totaled $.3 billion and $.1 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.       Home Equity Loan Portfolio       Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $30.4 billion as of September 30, 2016, or 14% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $18.0 billion, or 59%, were outstanding under primarily variable-rate home
equity lines of credit and $12.4 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 4% of the home equity portfolio was purchased impaired and 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of
September 30, 2016.      As of September 30, 2016, we were in an originated first lien position for approximately 54% of the total outstanding
portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we held or serviced the first lien position for an additional 3% of the portfolio. The remaining 43% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. The
credit performance of the majority of the home equity

portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.   
  Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. During the
draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest only or principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those
where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated with the borrower s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period
ending is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at September 30, 2016, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.   
      Table 27: Home Equity Lines of Credit   Draw Period End Dates     

(a)  
  Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in the remainder 2016 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.

32     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at September 30, 2016, for home
equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5% were 90 days or more past due, which
are accounted for as nonperforming. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may
include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR.      See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management
section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on our home equity loan portfolio. See also Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.   
   Auto Loan Portfolio       The auto loan
portfolio totaled $11.9 billion as of September 30, 2016, or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Of that total, $10.4 billion resides in the indirect auto portfolio, $1.2 billion in the direct auto portfolio, and $.3 billion in acquired or securitized
portfolios, which has been declining as no pools have been recently acquired. Indirect auto loan applications are generated from franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.   
  We have elected not to pursue non-prime auto lending as evidenced by an average new loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months of 760 for
indirect auto loans and 776 for direct auto loans. As of September 30, 2016, .3% of our auto loan portfolio was nonperforming and .4% of the portfolio was accruing past due. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our
various channels. The portfolio was composed of 58% new vehicle loans and 42% used vehicle loans at September 30, 2016.      The auto loan
portfolio s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by
product channel and product type, and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes, and credit metrics which include
FICO score, loan-to-value and term.       Energy Related Loan Portfolio       Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the oil and gas industry totaled $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2016, or 1% of our total loan portfolio and 2% of our total commercial lending portfolio. This
portfolio comprised approximately $1.0 billion in the midstream and downstream sectors, $.9 billion to oil services companies and $.6 billion to upstream sectors. Of the oil services portfolio, approximately $.2 billion is not
asset-  

based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector as of September 30, 2016 totaled $197 million, or 8% of total nonperforming assets.   
  Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the coal industry totaled $.5 billion as of September 30, 2016, or less than 1% of both our total loan portfolio
and our total commercial lending portfolio. Nonperforming loans in the coal industry as of September 30, 2016 totaled $63 million, or 3% of total nonperforming assets.       Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings        Consumer Loan Modifications
      We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid
foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize
both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally
classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs.      A temporary modification, with a term between three and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as
of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs, including both government-created Home Affordable Modification
Program (HAMP) and PNC-developed modification programs, generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.   
  We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers 
and servicing customers  needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 28 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      33    

Table 28: Consumer Real Estate Related Loan Modifications

(a)  
  All temporary modifications are home equity loans.        In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period available to a borrower. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to
the loan s contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.      Payment plans
may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. All payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrower s renewed willingness and ability to repay. Due to
the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the ALLL.      Under a HAMP trial payment period, we establish an
alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. This allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a
HAMP modification. Subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due, to include accrued interest and fees receivable, and restructure the loan s
contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account current. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, generally enrollment in the program does not significantly increase
the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies. After December 31, 2016, the government-created HAMP program will expire. As such, no new modifications will be
offered under the program after that date.   
 
    Commercial Loan Modifications and Payment Plans    
  Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the
interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a
concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.     We have established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs
for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the loan balances covered under these modification and payment plan programs, including those determined
to be TDRs, were not significant.       Troubled Debt Restructurings       A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate
reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court
imposed concessions ( e.g.  a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to PNC and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).      TDRs totaled $2.4 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $8 million during the first nine months of 2016. Excluded from TDRs are $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans
accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 55% and
53% of total nonperforming loans, and 50% and 48% of total TDRs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual accounting after performing under the
restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.

Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit    
      Table 29: Loan Charge-Offs And Recoveries     

Net charge-offs increased by $171 million, or 64%, in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first
nine months of 2015 due to higher commercial loan net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs exclude write-offs and recoveries related to purchased impaired loans.      We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease
portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at September 30, 2016 consisted of $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be
appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and
estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.   
  We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis,
except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including
commercial and

consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the
fair value of the underlying collateral.      Reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on probability of default (PD)
and loss given default (LGD) credit risk ratings.      Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such
as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by
collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data
is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loan data and will periodically refine our PDs and LGDs as well as consider regulatory guidance
and management judgment.      Allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical
relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.

A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are
not limited to, the following:   

Industry concentrations and conditions,     

Recent credit quality trends,      

Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,      

Recent macro-economic factors,     

Model imprecision,      

Changes in lending policies and procedures,      

Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and      

Limitations of available historical data.         Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair
values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At September 30, 2016, we had reserves of $.3 billion for
purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value .  No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of
acquisition.      In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of
commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial
lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity.
     In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a
liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine
this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our
ALLL.      See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part
I, Item 1 of this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.

Table 30: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses     

(a)  
  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain purchased impaired
loans.        The provision for credit losses increased to $366 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $181 million for
the first nine months of 2015, primarily driven by energy related exposure, slowing credit quality improvement and the impact of continued loan growth.      At September 30, 2016, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 122%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2015 was 128%. These ratios are 91% and 98%, respectively, when excluding the $.7 billion
and $.6 billion of ALLL at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded consumer loans and lines of
credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. Additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their
delinquency status as interest is accreted in accordance with ASC 310-30 based on the recorded investment balance. See Table 23 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.   
  The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and
changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first nine months of 2016, overall credit quality remained relatively stable offsetting impacts from certain energy related loans, which resulted in a slight ALLL balance decline of $.1 billion, or
4% to $2.6 billion as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.

       Liquidity Risk Management        Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity Risk Management section of our 2015 Form 10-K.   
  One of the ways PNC monitors its liquidity is by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to
ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution s high quality,
unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is
expressed as a percentage. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain is 90% in 2016. Between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank were required to calculate the LCR on a month-end basis. Effective July 1, 2016,
PNC and PNC Bank began calculating the LCR on a daily basis. As of September 30, 2016, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the 2017 fully phased-in requirement of 100%.      We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on PNC in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our
2015 Form 10-K.       Bank Level Liquidity   Uses       At the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. As of September 30,
2016, there were approximately $10.5 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year, including $1.1 billion in borrowings from an affiliate. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand
and provide for other business needs, as
necessary.  
 
    Bank Level Liquidity   Sources    
  Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base generated by our retail and commercial banking businesses. Total deposits
increased to $259.9 billion at September 30, 2016 from $249.0 billion at December 31, 2015, driven by growth in savings deposits and demand deposits, partially offset by a decline in money market deposits and time deposits in foreign offices and
other time deposits. Assets determined by PNC to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and
long-term funding sources.      At September 30, 2016, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale
agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $30.4 billion and securities available for sale totaling $61.9 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $92.3 billion, we had $3.5 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust
deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition to the liquid assets we pledged, $6.5 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.   
  In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank
also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase
agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings).      Under PNC Bank s 2014 bank note program, dated January 16, 2014 and
amended May 22, 2015 and May 27, 2016, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the
case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. The $40.0 billion of notes includes notes issued by PNC Bank under the 2004 bank note program and those notes PNC Bank has assumed through the
acquisition of other banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. The terms of the 2014 bank note program, as amended, do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to January 16, 2014. At September 30, 2016, PNC Bank had
$24.9 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $18.7 billion was senior bank notes and $6.2 billion was subordinated bank notes. The following table details all issuances during 2016:

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      37    

Table 31: PNC Bank Notes Issued During 2016     
   
    Total senior and subordinated debt of PNC Bank increased to $26.7 billion at September 30, 2016 from $25.5 billion at
December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period.         Table 32: PNC Bank Senior and
Subordinated Debt         
    PNC Bank is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally
by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At September 30, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $26.8 billion with the FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings decreased to $17.1
billion at September 30, 2016 from $20.1 billion at December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period.

Table 33: FHLB Borrowings     
   
    The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank to secure certain public
deposits. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiary s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to PNC Bank. At September 30, 2016, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the
FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $4.7 billion.      PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional
liquidity. As of September 30, 2016, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.      PNC Bank can also borrow from the Federal
Reserve Bank discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed
environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At September 30, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $17.2 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.   
   Parent Company Liquidity       As of
September 30, 2016, available parent company liquidity totaled $3.3 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments
with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.       Parent Company Liquidity   Uses      The parent company s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. As of September 30, 2016, there were approximately $.6 billion of parent company borrowings with contractual maturities of less
than one year. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.   
  See the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for information on our 2016 capital plan that was
accepted by the Federal Reserve. Our capital plan included a recommendation to

38     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the third quarter of 2016 and also included share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third
quarter of 2016. More information on our share repurchase programs, including detail on our third quarter repurchase of 5.9 million common shares for $.5 billion, is included in the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this
Financial Review.      On July 7, 2016, consistent with our 2016 capital plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNC s quarterly
common stock dividend from 51 cents per common share to 55 cents per common share beginning with the August 5, 2016 dividend payment.      See the
Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Federal Reserve s CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans,
qualitative and quantitative liquidity risk management standards proposed by the U.S. banking agencies, and final rules issued by the Federal Reserve that make certain modifications to the Federal Reserve s capital planning and stress testing
rules.       Parent Company Liquidity   Sources       The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:   

Bank-level capital needs,      

Laws and regulations,      

Corporate policies,      

Contractual restrictions, and      

Other factors.         There are
statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC
Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.5 billion at September 30, 2016. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2015 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations. We provide additional information
on certain contractual restrictions in Note 16 Equity in our 2015 Form 10-K.      In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent
company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments.      We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private
markets and commercial paper.      Total parent company senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments decreased to $6.4 billion at
September 30,

2016 from $7.5 billion at December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period.      See Note 15 Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for information on the issuance of depository shares, each representing a 1/100   th    interest in a share of our Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series S.          Table 34: Parent Company Senior and Subordinated Debt and Hybrid
Capital Instruments         
    The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of
September 30, 2016, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.      Status of Credit Ratings    
  The cost and availability of short-term and long-term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by
PNC s credit ratings. See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on credit ratings.          Table 35: Credit Ratings as of September 30, 2016 for PNC and PNC Bank

     Contractual Obligations and Commitments       We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits, and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity Risk
Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet.   

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      39    

We provide information on our commitments in Note 13 Commitments and Guarantees in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.        Market Risk Management        Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic
value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among
others:       

Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,      

Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and      

Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.
        We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market
Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board.       Market Risk Management           Interest Rate Risk    
  Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic
and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources.
Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.   
  Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by
management s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 follow:
         Table 36: Interest Sensitivity Analysis     

(a)  
  Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.
       In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely
simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 37 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist s most likely rate forecast, (ii)
implied market forward rates and (iii) Yield Curve Slope Flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between 1-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.   
      Table 37: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios (Third Quarter 2016)     

40     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current
market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.      When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about
interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the
base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 36 and 37 above. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. We also consider
forward projections of purchase accounting accretion when forecasting net interest income.      The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield
curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.          Table 38: Alternate
Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward            

The third quarter 2016 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to
benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and
market conditions.       Market Risk Management   Customer-Related Trading Risk    
  We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers  investing and hedging activities. These
transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these
products.      We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is
used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk

factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first nine months of
2016 and 2015 were within our acceptable limits.      See the Market Risk Management   Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our
2015 Form 10-K for more information on the models and backtesting.      Customer related trading revenue was $140 million for the first nine
months of 2016 compared with $155 million for the first nine months of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivatives.      Customer related trading revenue was $51 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $53 million for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to reduced client related foreign
exchange results.       Market Risk Management   Equity And Other Investment Risk    
  Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending
credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and growth financings in a variety of industries. We
also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing
rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.      The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital.
Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of an institution rated single-A by the
credit rating agencies. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. See Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and Note 7 Fair
Value in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.      Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our
businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

A summary of our equity investments follows:          Table 39: Equity Investments Summary         
     BlackRock    
  PNC owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at September 30, 2016, accounted for under the equity method. The
primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information about BlackRock.   
   Tax Credit Investments       Included in our
equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated partnerships. These equity investment balances include unfunded commitments totaling $719 million and $669 million at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.      Note 2 Loan Sale and
Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K has further information on Tax Credit Investments.       Private Equity       The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of
mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment and are carried at estimated fair value. As of September 30, 2016, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.3 billion was invested
indirectly through various private equity funds. Included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The interests held in indirect private equity funds are not
redeemable, but PNC may receive distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments. See Item 1 Business   Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2015 Form 10-K
for discussions of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and sponsorship of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.

Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $128 million at September 30, 2016 and $126
million at December 31, 2015.       Visa       Our 2015 Form 10-K includes information regarding the October 2007 Visa restructuring, our involvement with judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks, the status of pending
interchange litigation, the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares and the related swap agreements with the purchaser. See Note 12 Legal Proceedings in our Second Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q for more detail on the status of the pending
interchange litigation.      During the first nine months of 2016, we sold 1.35 million Visa Class B common shares, in addition to the 18.5
million shares sold in previous years. We have entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares as part of these sales. At September 30, 2016, our investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 3.5 million shares.
Based on the September 30, 2016 closing price of $82.70 for the Visa Class A common shares, the fair value of our total investment was $479 million at the current conversion rate. The Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only
under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the final resolution of all of the specified litigation.      Other Investments       We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which
represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both. Given the nature of these
investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses. Net gains related to these investments were not significant for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015.   
  Our unfunded commitments related to other investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not significant.   
   Financial Derivatives       Information on
our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 7 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 6 Fair Value and Note 9 Financial Derivatives in the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference.      Not all elements of
market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.      Based on that
evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934) were effective as of September 30, 2016, and that there has been no change in PNC s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

C AUTIONARY  S TATEMENT  R EGARDING 
F ORWARD -L OOKING  I NFORMATION        We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time
make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting PNC and its future business and
operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as  believe,   plan,   expect, 
 anticipate,   see,   look,   intend,   outlook,   project,   forecast,   estimate,   goal,   will,   should  and other similar words and
expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.      Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements,
as well as from historical performance.      Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.

Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:

Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.     

Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.     

The impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as
issues surrounding the levels of U.S. and European government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe.     

Actions by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

Changes in customers , suppliers  and other counterparties  performance and creditworthiness.     

Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.     

Continued residual effects of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, including adverse impacts
on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations.     

Commodity price volatility.     

Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors.

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than
those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economy will grow moderately in the latter half of 2016, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving housing activity and moderate job gains, and that
short-term interest rates and bond yields will hold fairly steady before gradually rising late this year. Specifically, our business outlook reflects our expectation of a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in
December 2016. These forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.      

PNC s ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common
stock under current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the Federal Reserve as part of PNC s comprehensive capital plan for the
applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve s CCAR process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve.      

PNC s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company s financial performance, the scope and terms of
final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the international body responsible for developing
global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions), and management actions affecting the composition of PNC s balance sheet. In addition, PNC s ability to determine, evaluate and
forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations,
competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These
developments could include:      

Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services
industry and changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies

44     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

and principles. We will be impacted by extensive reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) and otherwise growing out
of the most recent financial crisis, the precise nature, extent and timing of which, and their impact on us, remains uncertain.     

Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel Committee.

Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. In addition to matters relating to
PNC s current and historical business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to  pre-acquisition  business and activities of acquired companies,
such as National City. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause
reputational harm to PNC.     

Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.     

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where
appropriate, through effective use of third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. In particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage
elevated levels of impaired assets.      

Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information
provided to us by

BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.      

We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and
other liabilities. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting
from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.      

Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share,
deposits and revenues. Industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. Our
ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.      

Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities,
cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.         We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2015 Form 10-K, our 2016 Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and
the Legal Proceedings and Commitments and Guarantees Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere
in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

  T HE  PNC F INANCIAL  S ERVICES  G ROUP , I NC .   
    
    B USINESS        The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   
  We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential mortgage banking, providing many of
our products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C.,
Delaware, Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally.   
     N OTE  1 A CCOUNTING  P OLICIES     
    Basis of Financial Statement Presentation        Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests, and variable interest entities.
     We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2016 presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or
results of operations. Additionally, we evaluate the materiality of identified errors in the financial statements using both an income statement and a balance sheet approach, based on relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.   
  In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results
for the interim periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period.      We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.      When preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015

Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note 1 Accounting Policies in the 2015 Form 10-K for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant
changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These interim consolidated financial statements serve to update the 2015 Form 10-K and may not include all information and notes necessary to constitute a
complete set of financial statements.        Use of Estimates        We prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.
Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements, allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, and accretion on purchased impaired loans. Actual results may differ from the estimates
and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.        Recently Adopted Accounting Standards     
  We did not adopt new accounting standards that had a significant impact during the third quarter of 2016.

Servicing Activities        As more fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2015
Form 10-K, we have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. Our continuing involvement generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred
loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization special purpose entities (SPEs).      We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the
consummation date of each type of loan transfer where PNC retains the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for information on our servicing rights, including the carrying value of
servicing assets.

(a)  
  Represents cash flow information associated with both commercial mortgage loan transfer and servicing activities.     

(b)  
  These activities were part of an acquired brokered home equity lending business in which PNC is no longer engaged.     

(c)  
  Gains/losses recognized on sales of loans were insignificant for the periods presented.     

(d)  
  Includes residential mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans eligible for repurchase through the exercise of our Removal of Account Provision (ROAP) option, and
loans repurchased due to alleged breaches of origination covenants or representations and warranties made to purchasers. Includes home equity lines of credit repurchased at the end of their draw periods due to contractual requirements.

(e)  
  Includes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.     

(f)  
  Represents cash flows on securities we hold issued by a securitization SPE in which PNC transferred to and/or services loans. The carrying values of such securities
held were $6.7 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.0 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at September 30, 2016 and $5.8 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.1 billion in commercial
mortgage-backed securities at September 30, 2015. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, the carrying values of such securities held were $6.6 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.3 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
       The table below presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing
involvement with these loans. For more information regarding our recourse and repurchase obligations, including our reserve of estimated losses, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section of Note 21 Commitments and Guarantees in our 2015

  These activities were part of an acquired brokered home equity lending business in which PNC is no longer engaged.     

(c)  
  Serviced delinquent loans are 90 days or more past due or are in process of foreclosure.     

(d)  
  Net charge-offs for Residential mortgages and Home equity loans/lines represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the
period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do
not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.          Variable
Interest Entities (VIEs)        As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2015 Form
10-K, we are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. The following provides a summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not
consolidated into our financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amounts presented for September 30, 2016 are based on the assessments performed in accordance with ASC 810 as amended by ASU 2015-02 and
adopted in the first quarter of 2016. Specifically, the ASU modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities (VOEs). We have not provided additional financial support to these
entities which we are not contractually required to provide.

(a)  
  Amounts represent carrying value on PNC s Consolidated Balance Sheet.     
    The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing involvement to
be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between PNC and the VIE. We have excluded certain transactions with
non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 44 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant.      In
addition, where PNC only has lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 44. These loans are included
as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Asset Quality.

(g)  
  Included in Deposits and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.        We make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs). The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to
assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $160 million of amortization, $167 million of tax credits, and $58 million of other tax benefits associated
with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes. The amounts for the third quarter of 2016 were $55 million, $56 million and $20 million, respectively.         N OTE  3 A SSET  Q UALITY     
  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be
a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered
delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale, purchased impaired loans, nonperforming loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option which are on nonaccrual status, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and
accruing loans accounted for under the fair value option.      Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed
assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these
loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain
government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as
we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.     See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for
additional delinquency, nonperforming, and charge-off information.

The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.          Table 45: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a)     

(a)  
  Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued
interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.     

(b)  
  Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original
contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.     

(c)  
  Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual
accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.     

(d)  
  Net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     

(e)  
  Future accretable yield related to purchased impaired loans is not included in the analysis of loan portfolio.     
 
    At September 30, 2016, we pledged $21.9 billion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and $59.1
billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were $20.2 billion and $56.4 billion, respectively.

Table 46: Nonperforming Assets     

(a)  
  Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on
nonperforming status.     

(b)  
  Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired
loans.     

(c)  
  The recorded investment of loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $.4 billion and $.6 billion at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, both included $.3 billion of loans that are government insured/guaranteed.        Nonperforming loans also
include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and the TDR section within this Note.      Total nonperforming loans in the nonperforming assets table
above include TDRs of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are
excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been
discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms
are not returned to accrual status.   
 
     Additional Asset Quality Indicators        We have two overall portfolio segments   Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in
initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, and commercial purchased impaired loan
classes. The Consumer Lending segment is composed of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card, other consumer, and consumer purchased impaired loan classes.        Commercial Lending Asset Classes         Commercial Loan Class    
  For commercial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the
loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process on an ongoing basis.
These ratings are reviewed and updated, generally at least once per year. Additionally, no less frequently than on an annual basis, we review PD rates related to each rating grade based upon internal historical data. These rates are updated as
needed and augmented by market data as deemed necessary. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial loans, mortgages and leases, we apply statistical modeling to assist in determining the probability of default within these pools. Further, on
a periodic basis, we update our LGD estimates associated with each rating grade based upon historical data. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to a commercial loan, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss
severity in event of default, reflects the relative estimated likelihood of loss for that loan at the reporting date. In general, loans with better PD and LGD tend to have a lower likelihood of loss compared to loans with worse PD and LGD. The loss
amount also considers an estimate of exposure at date of default, which we also periodically update based upon historical data.      Based upon
the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic review. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market s or business unit s entire loan portfolio, focusing on those
loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We
attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.

Commercial Real Estate Loan Class       We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks connected with
commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in
assessing credit risk.      As with the commercial class, a formal schedule of periodic review is also performed to assess market/geographic risk
and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, including adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that
concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and take actions to mitigate our exposure to such risks.

Equipment Lease Financing Loan Class       We manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing loan class similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.      Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and of the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic review. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to
review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory
compliance.       Commercial Purchased Impaired Loan Class       Estimates of the expected cash flows primarily determine the valuation of commercial purchased impaired loans. Commercial cash flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items, which
include but are not limited to: estimated collateral value, receipt of additional collateral, secondary trading prices, circumstances of possible and/or ongoing liquidation, capital availability, business operations and payment patterns.   
  We attempt to proactively manage these factors by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan. These procedures include a
review by our Special Asset Committee, ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.

  Based upon PDs and LGDs. We apply a split rating classification to certain loans meeting threshold criteria. By assigning a split classification, a loan s exposure
amount may be split into more than one classification category in the above table.     

(b)  
  Loans are included above based on the Regulatory Classification definitions of  Pass ,  Special Mention ,  Substandard  and
 Doubtful .     

(c)  
  Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in
deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at this time.     

(d)  
  Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct
possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.     

(e)  
  Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in
full improbable due to existing facts, conditions, and values.

Consumer Lending Asset Classes         Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes       We use several credit quality
indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and geography, to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real
estate loan classes. We evaluate mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan servicers. A summary of asset quality indicators follows:       Delinquency/Delinquency Rates : We monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See the Asset Quality section of this Note 3 for additional
information.       Nonperforming Loans : We monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real estate loans. See
the Asset Quality section of this Note 3 for additional information.       Credit Scores : We use a national third-party provider to update
FICO credit scores for home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan
classes.       LTV (inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) for first and subordinate lien positions) : At least annually, we update the
property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV
migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes.      Historically, we used, and we continue to use, a
combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes ( e.g. , line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given
certain data limitations it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management s assumptions ( e.g. , if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, home price index (HPI) changes will be
incorporated in arriving at management s estimate of updated LTV).

Geography : Geographic concentrations are monitored to evaluate and manage exposures. Loan
purchase programs are sensitive to, and focused within, certain regions to manage geographic exposures and associated risks.      A combination of
updated FICO scores, originated and updated LTV ratios and geographic location assigned to home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans is used to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Loans with higher FICO scores and
lower LTVs tend to have a lower level of risk. Conversely, loans with lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, and in certain geographic locations tend to have a higher level of risk.       Consumer Purchased Impaired Loan Class       Estimates of the expected cash flows primarily
determine the valuation of consumer purchased impaired loans. Consumer cash flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items, which include, but are not limited to: estimated real estate values, payment patterns, updated FICO
scores, the current economic environment, updated LTV ratios and the date of origination. These key factors are monitored to help ensure that concentrations of risk are managed and cash flows are maximized.

Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes       We monitor a variety of asset quality information in the management of the credit card and other consumer loan classes. Other consumer loan classes include education, automobile, and other secured and
unsecured lines and loans. Along with the trending of delinquencies and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are generally obtained monthly, as well as a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a
lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.   
      Table 51: Credit Card and Other Consumer Loan Classes Asset Quality Indicators     

(a)  
  At September 30, 2016, we had $32 million of credit card loans that are higher risk (i.e., loans with both updated FICO scores less than 660 and in late stage (90+
days) delinquency status). The majority of the September 30, 2016 balance related to higher risk credit card loans was geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Pennsylvania 17%, Ohio 15%, Michigan 8%, New Jersey 8%, Florida 7%,
Illinois 6%, Maryland 5%, Indiana 5%, North Carolina 5% and Kentucky 4%. All other states had less than 4% individually and make up the remainder of the balance. At December 31, 2015, we had $34 million of credit card loans that are higher risk. The
majority of the December 31, 2015 balance related to higher risk credit card loans was geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Ohio 17%, Pennsylvania 15%, Michigan 8%, New Jersey 8%, Florida 7%, Illinois 6%, Indiana 6%, Maryland
4% and North Carolina 4%. All other states had less than 4% individually and make up the remainder of the balance.     

(b)  
  Other consumer loans for which updated FICO scores are used as an asset quality indicator include non-government guaranteed or insured education loans, automobile loans
and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Other consumer loans for which other internal credit metrics are used as an asset quality indicator include primarily government guaranteed or insured education loans, as well as consumer loans to
high net worth individuals. Other internal credit metrics may include delinquency status, geography or other factors.     

(c)  
  Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history,
accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name, and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when
necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk.

  Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are
excluded from nonperforming loans. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make
both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

obligations to PNC, as well as postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both consumer and commercial borrowers.        After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due
after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period preceding January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2015, respectively, and
(ii) subsequently defaulted during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $66 million and $118 million, respectively. The comparable amounts for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $29 million
and $69 million, respectively.      See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion on TDRs.

Impaired Loans        Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and
accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option,
smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these
impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.          Table 54: Impaired Loans

  Held to maturity securities transferred from available for sale are recorded in held to maturity at fair value at the time of transfer. The amortized cost of held to
maturity securities included net unrealized gains of $78 million and $97 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to securities transferred, which are offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax.

The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility
and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders  equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, unless credit-related. Securities held
to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At September 30, 2016, Accumulated other comprehensive income included pretax gains of $103 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity.
The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.

Table 58 presents gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the
amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) has been recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The decrease in total unrealized losses at September 30, 2016
when compared to December 31, 2015 was due to a decline in market interest rates.

  The unrealized loss on these securities was less than $.5 million.     
    
   The gross unrealized loss on debt securities held to maturity was $16 million at September 30, 2016, with
$10 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $.1 billion that had been in a continuous loss position less than 12 months and $6 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $.9 billion that had been in a
continuous loss position for more than 12 months. The gross unrealized loss on debt securities held to maturity was $82 million at December 31, 2015, with $59 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $5.5 billion that had
been in a continuous loss position less than 12 months and $23 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $953 million that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. For securities transferred to held to
maturity from available for sale, the unrealized loss for purposes of this analysis is determined by comparing the security s original amortized cost to its current estimated fair
value.  
 
     Evaluating Investment Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments     
  For the securities in the preceding Table 58, as of September 30, 2016 we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the
securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.      As more fully described in Note 6 Investment Securities in our 2015 Form 10-K, at
least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level assessment on all securities. For those securities in an unrealized loss position we determine if OTTI exists. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security
is less than its amortized cost basis. An OTTI loss must be recognized for a debt security in an unrealized loss position if we intend to sell the security or it

68     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Even if we do not expect to sell the security, we must evaluate the expected cash
flows to be received to determine if we believe a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. The portion of the unrealized loss relating to other
factors, such as liquidity conditions in the market or changes in market interest rates, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 6 Investment Securities in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional details on this quarterly
assessment.      For those securities on our balance sheet where we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses
of $1.1 billion at September 30, 2016. During the first

nine months of 2016 and 2015, the OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on
securities were not significant.      Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth
in the following table.          Table 59: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available for Sale

Weighted-average yields are based on historical cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual
maturity of each security. At September 30, 2016, there were no securities of a single issuer, other than FNMA, that exceeded 10% of Total shareholders  equity. The FNMA investments had a total amortized cost of $28.4 billion and fair value of
$29.0 billion.      The following table presents the fair value of securities that have been either pledged to or accepted from others to

        Fair Value Measurement        PNC measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined in GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be
paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. GAAP focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. GAAP also establishes a fair value
hierarchy to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy see Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.       Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis        For more

  Level 3 residential mortgage-backed non-agency and asset-backed securities with fair values as of September 30, 2016 totaling $2.9 billion and $.4 billion,
respectively, were priced by a third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow pricing model that incorporates consensus pricing, where available. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2015 were $3.4 billion and $.4 billion, respectively. The
significant unobservable inputs for these securities were provided by the third-party vendor and are disclosed in the table. Our procedures to validate the prices provided by the third-party vendor related to these securities are discussed further
in the Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis section of Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K. Certain Level 3 residential mortgage-backed non-agency and asset-backed securities with fair values as of September 30,
2016 of $518 million and $28 million, respectively, were valued using a pricing source, such as a dealer quote or comparable security price, for which the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the price were not reasonably available. The

I NTANGIBLE  A SSETS          Goodwill        See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information regarding our goodwill.        Mortgage Servicing Rights        We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for
others as an intangible asset. MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. MSRs totaled $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing
contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.     MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected
prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or
decrease) in value when the value of MSRs decreases (or increases).      See the Sensitivity Analysis section of this Note 7, as well as Note 6
Fair Value for more detail on our fair value measurement of MSRs. Refer to Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on our accounting and measurement of MSRs.   
  Changes in the commercial and residential MSRs follow:          Table 70: Mortgage Servicing Rights         

(a)  
  Represents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or
paid off during the period.     

(b)  
  Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.     
    
    Sensitivity Analysis       The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of September 30, 2016 are shown in the tables below. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan
prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential
mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest
rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments.

Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.      A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented below. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging
activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value
of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates,
could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.   

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      81    

The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity
analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:

    Fees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees
were $.1 billion for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $.4 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided
to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported on our Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.

Other Intangible Assets        Other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles, customer lists and non-compete agreements. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information

P LANS          Pension And Postretirement Plans        As described in Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2015 Form 10-K, we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash
balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.   
  We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for
qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension is unfunded.   
  The components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were as follows:

  We use derivative financial instruments (derivatives) primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the effects
that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between
parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.   
  For more information regarding derivatives see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 14 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To Consolidated Financial
Statements under Item 8 in our 2015 Form 10-K.      The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative
assets and liabilities held by PNC:          Table 74: Total Gross Derivatives

  Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.     

(b)  
  Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.        All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is
included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section below. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives.   
    Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP        Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging
the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are   
         The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      83    

considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains
and losses on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.      Further detail regarding the notional amounts and fair values related to derivatives designated in hedge relationships is presented in the following table:

  Includes zero-coupon swaps.         Fair Value
Hedges       We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt
caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations
in market interest rates. For these hedge relationships, we use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of derivative gains or
losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.      Further detail regarding gains (losses) on fair value hedge derivatives and
related hedged items is presented in the following table:          Table 76: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and
Related Hedged Items   Fair Value Hedges (a)         

(a)  
  The difference between the gains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives and their related hedged items represents the ineffective portion of the change in value
of our fair value hedge derivatives.     
      
   84     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

Cash Flow Hedges       We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in
future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other
comprehensive income and are reclassified to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of interest received on the loans. In the 12 months that follow September 30, 2016, we expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in
Accumulated other comprehensive income, net derivative gains of $199 million pretax, or $130 million after-tax, in association with interest received on the hedged loans. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in
interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2016. The maximum length of time over which forecasted loan cash flows are hedged is five years. We use statistical regression analysis to assess the
effectiveness of these hedge relationships at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis.

We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the
consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is
typically minimal. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. In the 12 months that follow September 30, 2016, we
expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net derivative gains of $56 million pretax, or $36 million after-tax, as adjustments of yield on investment securities. As of September 30, 2016, the
maximum length of time over which forecasted purchase contracts are hedged is one month.      There were no components of derivative gains or
losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to either cash flow hedge strategy.      During the first nine months of 2016
and 2015, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.

Further detail regarding gains
(losses) on derivatives and related cash flows is presented in the following table:          Table 77: Gains (Losses)

(b)  
  The amount of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income was not significant for the periods presented.     
    
    Net Investment Hedges       We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. Dollar (USD) net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging
relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an
ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness. During the first nine months of 2016 and
2015, there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness. Gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were net

gains of $27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and net gains of $136 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net gains of $43 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 and net gains of $32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.        Derivatives Not
Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP        We also enter into derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges under GAAP.

referenced in the swap contracts defaulted at September 30, 2016, the exposure from these agreements would be $181 million based on the fair value of the underlying swaps, compared with $122 million at December 31, 2015.   
    Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features        We, generally, utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements.
The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting

agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize
either party s net position.      For additional information on derivative offsetting, counterparty credit risk, and contingent features see
Note 14 Financial Derivatives in our 2015 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Guarantees in this Report for additional information related to resale and repurchase agreements offsetting.   
  The following derivative Table 80 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally
enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.

  The table above includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, cleared derivatives, and exchange-traded derivatives. OTC derivatives represent contracts
executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable industry
standard master netting agreements. Cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives
represent standardized futures and options contracts executed directly on an organized exchange.      In addition to using master netting
agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring
procedures.   
      
   88     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

At September 30, 2016, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling
$1.2 billion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.6 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities
owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a
master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not
netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities
held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet.

Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that
require PNC s debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If PNC s debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request
immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net
liability position on September 30, 2016 was $1.3 billion for which PNC had posted collateral of $1.1 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral PNC would have been required to post if the
credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on September 30, 2016 would be $.2 billion.

Table 84: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components

N OTE  12 L EGAL  P ROCEEDINGS 
      We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when
information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed
circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings
( Disclosed Matters,  which are those matters disclosed in this Note 12 as well as those matters disclosed in Note 20 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K, in Note 14 Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our
first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and in Note 12 Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our second quarter 2016 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure collectively referred to as  Prior Disclosure )). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to
estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of September 30, 2016, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount of up to
approximately $525 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we
may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal
proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.      In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently

contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class
action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory
and governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; discovery has not
started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future
decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants).
Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.   
  As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such
losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the
Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as
discussed below under  Other.    

92     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information
related to the plaintiff s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a
matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.   
  Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance
coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible
losses.      The following updates our disclosure of legal proceedings from that provided in Prior Disclosure.   
    CBNV Mortgage Litigation        In
August 2016, in the lawsuits consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania under the caption    In re: Community Bank of Northern Virginia Lending Practices
Litigation  (No. 03-0425 (W.D. Pa.), MDL No. 1674), we reached a settlement with the plaintiffs, subject to notice to the class and court approval. In September 2016, the court granted preliminary approval, authorized the sending of
notice to the class, set the timing for objections and scheduled a final approval hearing for December 2016. Under this settlement, the matter will be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators, who will determine whether
we will pay the plaintiff class either an amount (inclusive of class counsel fees and expenses) we proposed ($24 million) or an amount proposed by the plaintiffs ($70 million), with no discretion to choose any other amount. The court has ordered the
arbitrators to reach a decision by the end of March 2017.        Captive Mortgage Reinsurance Litigation     
  In September 2016, in  White, et al. v. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., et al.  (Civil Action No. 11-7928), pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs moved to lift the stay and for permission to file a Third Amended Class Action Complaint. The proposed amended complaint, if allowed, would add claims under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and would assert that the RESPA claim is not barred by the statute of limitations because every acceptance of a reinsurance premium is a new  occurrence  for these purposes. We have opposed
the motion to amend.        Pre-need Funeral Arrangements        The cross appeals by the PNC defendants and the plaintiffs in  Jo Ann Howard, P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al.  (No.
4:09-CV-  

1252-ERW) were argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in September 2016.        Other Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries        PNC is the subject of investigations,
audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these
inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. These inquiries, including those described below and in Prior Disclosure, may lead to administrative, civil or
criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. These inquiries may result in
significant reputational harm or other adverse collateral consequences even if direct resulting remedies are not material to PNC.       

Through the U.S. Attorney s Office for the District of Maryland, the office of the Inspector General for the Small Business Administration (SBA)
served a subpoena on PNC in 2012 requesting documents concerning PNC s relationship with, including SBA-guaranteed loans made through, a broker named Jade Capital Investments, LLC (Jade), as well as information regarding other PNC-originated
SBA guaranteed loans made to businesses located in the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Certain of the Jade loans have been identified in an indictment and subsequent superseding indictment charging persons
associated with Jade with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, substantive violations of the federal bank fraud statute, and money laundering. In August 2016, we completed a settlement, without any admission of liability, in the amount of $9.5 million
that resolves the U.S. Attorney s Office investigation.         Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and
governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in this Note 12 and in Prior Disclosure.        Other
       In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in
the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate
liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to

The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q      93    

whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any
future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.      See Note 21 Commitments and Guarantees in Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Visa indemnification and our other obligations to provide indemnification,
including to current and former officers, directors, employees and agents of PNC and companies we have acquired.   
     N OTE  13 C OMMITMENTS   AND  G UARANTEES     
    Commitments        In the normal course
of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with significant other commitments as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.          Table 85: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other
Commitments

  Represents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts, and reflects estimates based on availability of financial information
from insurance carriers. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate maximum exposure amount comprised $1.6 billion for accidental death   dismemberment contracts and $.3 billion for credit life, accident   health contracts. Comparable amounts
at December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $.4 billion, respectively.     

(c)  
  We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.     
     Commitments to Extend Credit       Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer s credit quality deteriorates. Based on our historical experience, some commitments expire unfunded, and therefore cash requirements
are substantially less than the total commitment.       Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit    
  We issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support
obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Internal credit ratings related to our net outstanding standby letters of credit were as
follows:          Table 86: Internal Credit Ratings Related to Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit

  Indicates that expected risk of loss is currently low.     

(b)  
  Indicates a higher degree of risk of default.     
      
   94     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.    Form 10-Q    

If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of
the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on September
30, 2016 had terms ranging from less than 1 year to 8 years.      As of September 30, 2016, assets of $1.0 billion secured certain specifically
identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers  other obligations to us. The
carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
      Reinsurance Agreements       We
have a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary which provides reinsurance for accidental death   dismemberment, credit life, and accident   health, all of which are in run-off. This subsidiary previously entered into these various types of
reinsurance agreements with third-party insurers where the subsidiary assumed the risk of loss through quota share agreements up to 100% reinsurance. In quota share agreements, the subsidiary and the third-party insurers share the responsibility for
payment of all claims.       Recourse and Repurchase Obligations        As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/lines of credit directly or
indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets. See Note 21
Commitments and Guarantees in our 2015 Form 10-K for details related to our Recourse and Repurchase Obligations.

Resale and Repurchase Agreements        We enter into repurchase and resale agreements where we transfer investment securities to/from a third party with the agreement to repurchase/resell those investment securities at a future date for a
specified price. These agreements are entered into primarily to provide short-term financing for securities inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions and accommodate customers  investing and financing needs. Repurchase
and resale agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions for accounting purposes and are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest. Our policy is
to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. We monitor the market value of securities to be repurchased and resold and additional collateral may be obtained where considered appropriate to protect against credit exposure.
     Repurchase and resale agreements are typically entered into with counterparties under industry standard master netting agreements which
provide for the right to offset amounts owed to one another with respect to multiple repurchase and resale agreements under such master netting agreement (referred to as netting arrangements) and liquidate the purchased or borrowed securities in the
event of counterparty default. In order for an arrangement to be eligible for netting under GAAP, we must obtain the requisite assurance that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable in the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of such third party. Enforceability is evidenced by obtaining a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy.  
  Table 87 shows the amounts owed under resale and repurchase agreements and the securities collateral associated with those agreements where a legal
opinion supporting the enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained. We do not present resale and repurchase agreements entered into with the same counterparty under a legally enforceable master netting agreement on a net basis on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet or within Table 87.      Refer to Note 9 Financial Derivatives for additional information related to offsetting of
financial derivatives.

      N OTE  14 S EGMENT  R EPORTING 
      We have six reportable business segments:

Corporate   Institutional Banking      

Asset Management Group      

Residential Mortgage Banking      

BlackRock      

Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio         Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP;
therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the
extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.   
  Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the
results for corporate support functions within  Other  for financial reporting purposes.      Net interest income in business segment
results reflects PNC s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing
characteristics, tenor and other factors.      A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business
segments using our risk-based

economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments, ultimately reflecting PNC s
portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.      We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and
letters of credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial
strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.      Our allocation of the costs incurred by
operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.      Total business
segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the  Other  category in the business segment tables.  Other  includes residual activities that do not meet the
criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary
impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, and differences
between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments  results exclude their portion of net

   Asset Management Group  includes personal wealth management for high net worth and ultra high net worth clients and institutional asset management.
Wealth management products and services include investment and retirement planning, customized investment management, private banking, tailored credit solutions, and trust management and administration for individuals and their families. Our
Hawthorn unit provides multi-generational family planning including wealth strategy, investment management, private banking, tax and estate planning guidance, performance reporting and personal administration services to ultra high net worth
families. Institutional asset management provides advisory, custody administration and retirement administration services. The business also offers

PNC proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. Institutional clients include corporations, unions, municipalities, non-profits, foundations and endowments, primarily located in our
geographic footprint.       Residential Mortgage Banking  directly originates first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis
with a significant presence within the retail banking footprint. Mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate. These loans are typically underwritten to government agency and/or third-party standards,
and either sold with servicing retained or held on PNC s balance sheet. Loan sales are primarily to secondary mortgage conduits of FNMA, FHLMC, Federal Home Loan Banks and third-party investors, or are securitized and issued under the GNMA
program. The mortgage servicing operation performs all functions related to servicing mortgage loans, primarily those in first lien position, for various investors and for loans owned by PNC.       BlackRock  is a leading publicly traded investment management firm providing a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide. Using a diverse
platform of active and index investment strategies across asset classes, BlackRock develops investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities,
fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. BlackRock also offers an investment and risk management technology platform, risk analytics and advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional investors.   
  We hold an equity investment in BlackRock, which provides us with an additional source of noninterest income and increases our overall revenue
diversification. BlackRock is a publicly traded company, and additional information regarding its business is available in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At September 30, 2016, our economic interest in BlackRock was
22%. PNC received cash dividends from BlackRock of $248 million and $240 million during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
   Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio  includes a consumer portfolio of mainly residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans and lines of credit and
a small commercial lending portfolio. We obtained a significant portion of these non-strategic assets through acquisitions of other companies.

Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series S, in an underwritten public offering resulting in gross proceeds of $525 million to us before commissions and expenses. We issued 5,250 shares of Series S Preferred Stock to the depositary in this transaction. We

  Nonaccrual loans are included in loans, net of unearned income. The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest
income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on
amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in trading noninterest
income, are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities.

(a)  
  To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest yields for all earning assets, interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The above table reconciles the total adjusted net interest income to the GAAP reportable net
interest income amount disclosed in our Consolidated Income Statement.

P ERIODS         

(a)  
  PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios, to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the
regulatory capital standards that will ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules.     

(b)  
  Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may
be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC s models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as PNC moves through the parallel run process.

(c)  
  Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and
other postretirement plans.     

(d)  
  Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.

(e)  
  Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted
assets. During the parallel run qualification phase PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. Refinements implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced
estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements may result in increases or decreases to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
      Details of our repurchases of PNC common stock during the third quarter of 2016 are included in the following table:   

(a)  
  Includes PNC common stock purchased in connection with our various employee benefit plans generally related to forfeitures of unvested restricted stock awards and
shares used to cover employee payroll tax withholding requirements. Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 13 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K include
additional information regarding our employee benefit and equity compensation plans that use PNC common stock.     

(b)  
  On March 11, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the establishment of a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of 100 million
shares of PNC common stock, effective April 1, 2015. Repurchases are made in open market or privately negotiated transactions and the timing and exact amount of common stock repurchases will depend on a number of factors including, among others,
market and general economic conditions, economic capital and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations, including the results of the
supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process.         

Our 2016 capital plan, submitted as part of the CCAR process and accepted by the Federal Reserve, included share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four
quarter period beginning with the third quarter of 2016, including repurchases of up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans. In the third quarter of 2016, in accordance with PNC s 2016 capital plan and under the share repurchase
authorization in effect during that period, we repurchased 5.9 million shares of common stock on the open market, with an average price of $85.25 per share and an aggregate repurchase price of $.5 billion. See the Capital portion of the Consolidated
Balance Sheet Review in Part I, Item 2 of this Report for more information on the share repurchase programs under the new share repurchase authorization for the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017 included in the 2016 capital plan accepted by
the Federal Reserve.

SERVICE-BASED VESTING REQUIREMENTS:  
    
   The Award is divided into four approximately equal portions that will satisfy the service-based vesting requirements ratably over four
years (each portion, a   Tranche  ) on four   Scheduled Vesting Dates  , as follows:     
         the first Tranche will satisfy the service-based vesting requirement

such earlier date as prescribed by Section B.2 below).   

PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING REQUIREMENTS:  
    
 Provided the service-based vesting requirements have been met, each Tranche will vest on the applicable Scheduled Vesting Date upon the achievement of the performance goals applicable to that Tranche, as set forth in  Appendix
C  to this Agreement.  

B.2   
    
    EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT PRIOR TO SCHEDULED VESTING  
  DATE(S) ON VESTING REQUIREMENTS    

RETIREMENT:  
    
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your employment with PNC is terminated due to your Retirement, and not for Cause, then the service-based vesting requirements of the Award will be satisfied as of
your Termination Date, but the Award will not vest until the Scheduled Vesting Date(s), subject to satisfaction of the performance-based vesting requirements and your continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.   
      -2-

DEATH:

satisfied as further described in  Appendix C .

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your termination of employment with PNC is an Anticipatory Termination, then the service-based vesting requirements of the Award will be satisfied as of the
Termination Date, but the Award will not vest until the Scheduled Vesting Date(s), subject to satisfaction of the performance-based vesting requirements and your continued compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  

TERMINATION FOLLOWING A CHANGE OF CONTROL:

through the date of a Change of Control, and your employment with PNC is terminated following such Change of Control but prior to a Scheduled Vesting Date(s), either (a) by PNC other than for Misconduct or (b) by you for Good Reason (a
  Qualifying Termination  ), then the service-based requirements of the Award will be satisfied as of your Termination Date, and the performance-based vesting requirements will be satisfied with respect to any outstanding Tranches as
described in  Appendix C .       For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control, the Award will not become vested until the service-based vesting requirements are satisfied, either as set forth in Section B.1. or as a result

  FORFEITURE UPON FAILURE TO MEET SERVICE-BASED VESTING REQUIREMENTS:  
    
 Except as otherwise provided in Section B.2 above, if you cease to be an employee of PNC prior to an applicable Scheduled Vesting Date, you will not have satisfied the service-based vesting requirements and the outstanding
unvested portion of the Award will be forfeited and cancelled without payment of any consideration by PNC as of your Termination Date. Upon such forfeiture or cancellation, neither you nor your successors, heirs, assigns or legal representatives
will have any further rights or interest in the Award under the Agreement.  

C.2

heirs, assigns or legal representatives will have any further rights or interest in the portion of the Award that relates to that Tranche under the Agreement.  

D.  
    
  DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS   

D.1  
    
  GENERALLY  
    
 As of the Effective Date, you will be entitled to earn accrued cash Dividend Equivalents on the vested Payout Share Units (defined in  Appendix C ) for each
Tranche,   
      -4-  

in an amount equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid (without interest or reinvestment) between the Grant Date and the Scheduled Vesting Date for that Tranche (or such earlier date in the event of your death or a
Change of Control), as though you were the record holder of such Payout Share Units, and such Payout Share Units had been issued and outstanding shares on the Grant Date through the Scheduled Vesting Date for that Tranche (or such earlier date in
the event of your death or a Change of Control).  

D.2  
    
  ACCRUED DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT PAYMENTS  
    
   (a)  Generally . Accrued Dividend Equivalents will vest and be paid out in cash, less the payment of any applicable withholding taxes
pursuant to Section 6 of  Appendix A , if and when the applicable Tranche vests and pays out (at which point such Dividend Equivalents will terminate). Dividend Equivalents are subject to the same vesting requirements and payout size
adjustments as the Tranche to which they relate. If the PRSUs to which such Dividend Equivalents relate are forfeited and cancelled, such related Dividend Equivalents will also be forfeited and cancelled without payment of any consideration by
PNC.       (b)  Payment Upon a Change of Control . Accrual of Dividend Equivalents
will cease as of the Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control, Dividend Equivalents accrued (without reinvestment or interest) between the Grant Date and the Change of Control will vest and be paid out in cash, less the payment of any applicable
withholding taxes pursuant to Section 6 of  Appendix A , if and when the applicable Tranche vests and pays out, as if you were the record holder of the number of Shares equal to the number of vested Payout Share Units underlying such Tranche
from the Grant Date through the date of the Change of Control.   

E.

E.2  
    
  FORM OF PAYMENT; AMOUNT

the number of Payout Share Units less the payment of any applicable withholding taxes pursuant to Section 6 of  Appendix A .     
 (b)  Payment On or After a Change of Control .     
 Upon vesting on or after a Change of Control, vested Payout Share Units will be settled at the time set forth in Section E.1 by payment to you of cash in an

pursuant to Section 2 of  Appendix A ), less the payment of any applicable withholding taxes pursuant to Section 6 of  Appendix A . Related accrued Dividend Equivalent payments will be paid to you in cash as described in Section

rescission, cancellation or recoupment, in whole or in part, if and to the extent so provided under PNC s Incentive Compensation Adjustment and Clawback Policy, as in effect from time to time with respect to the Award, or any other applicable

obligations imposed by Sections 1(a)   1(c) above, Section 1(d)(v)(Waiver of Jury Trial) below and Section 8(b)(Governing Law and Jurisdiction) below are separate and severable, and it is the intent of both parties that
if any restriction or obligation imposed by any of these provisions is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void for any reason whatsoever, the remaining provisions, restrictions and obligations will remain valid and binding upon you.
 
      --2--  

iv.  Reform . If any of Sections 1(a)   1(c) are determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because unreasonable either as to length of time or area to which the restriction applies, it is the intent of both parties that the court reduce and reform the restriction so as to apply the greatest
limitations considered enforceable by the court.    v.  Waiver of Jury Trial . Each of you and PNC hereby waives any
right to trial by jury with regard to any suit, action or proceeding under or in connection with any of Sections 1(a)   1(c).  
  2.  Capital Adjustments  .  
 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2(b), if applicable, if any corporate transactions such as stock dividends, stock splits,
spin-offs, split offs, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations or reorganizations of or by PNC (each a   Corporate Transaction  ) occur prior to the time, if any, that outstanding vested PRSUs are settled and paid, the Committee or
its delegate shall make those adjustments, if any, in the number, class or kind of PRSUs and related Dividend Equivalents then outstanding under the Award that it deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect the Corporate Transaction such that
your rights are neither enlarged nor diminished as a result of such Corporate Transaction, including without limitation (i) measuring the value per share unit of any share-denominated award amount authorized for payment to you by reference to
the per share value of the consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction and (ii) with respect to stock-payable PRSUs only, authorizing payment of the entire value of any award amount authorized
for payment to you to be paid in cash at the applicable time specified in this Agreement. All determinations hereunder will be made by the Committee or its delegate in its sole discretion and will be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on
all parties, including you.    (b) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, (i) the number, class and kind of PRSUs then outstanding
under the Award will automatically be adjusted to reflect the same changes as are made to outstanding shares of Common Stock generally, (ii) the value per share unit of any share-denominated award amount will be measured by reference to the per
share value of the consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction or Transactions if applicable, and (iii) with respect to stock-payable PRSUs only, if the effect of the Corporate Transaction or
Transactions on a holder of Common Stock is to convert that shareholder s holdings into consideration that does not consist solely (other than as to a minimal amount) of shares of Common Stock, then the entire value of any payment to be made to
you will be made solely in cash at the applicable time specified in this Agreement.  
      --3--  

3.  Fractional Shares  . No fractional Shares will be delivered to you. If the
outstanding vested PRSUs being settled in Shares include a fractional interest, such fractional interest will be eliminated by rounding down to the nearest whole share unit.

are issued and delivered in settlement of the Award pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.     5.  Transfer
Restrictions   .         (a) The Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, or otherwise
alienated or hypothecated.    (b) If you are deceased at the time any outstanding vested PRSUs are settled and paid out in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, such delivery of Shares, cash payment or other payment (as applicable) shall be made to the executor or administrator of your estate or to your other legal representative or, as permitted under the election procedures of
the Plan s third-party administrator, to your designated beneficiary, in each case, as determined in good faith by PNC. Any delivery of Shares, cash payment or other payment made in good faith by PNC to your executor, other legal representative
or permissible designated beneficiary, or retained by PNC for taxes pursuant to Section 6 of this  Appendix A , shall extinguish all right to payment hereunder.  
 (c)  Applicable Laws . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, PNC will not be required to comply with any term, covenant or
condition of this Agreement if and to the extent prohibited by law, including but not limited to Federal banking and securities regulations, or as otherwise directed by one or more regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over PNC.  
  6.  Withholding Taxes  .     
 (a) You shall be solely responsible for any applicable taxes (including, without limitation, income and excise taxes), penalties and interest
that you incur in connection hereunder. PNC will, at the time any withholding tax obligation arises in connection herewith, retain an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount of taxes then required to be withheld by PNC in connection
therewith from amounts then payable hereunder to you.    (b) If any such withholding is required prior to the time amounts are payable to
you hereunder or if such amounts are not sufficient to satisfy such obligation in full, the withholding will be taken from other compensation then payable to you or as otherwise determined by PNC.

Person determines otherwise, with respect to stock-payable PRSUs only, PNC will retain whole Shares from any amounts then payable to you hereunder (or pursuant to any other PRSUs previously  
      --4--  

awarded to you under the Plan) in the form of Shares. For purposes of this Section 6(c), Shares retained to satisfy applicable withholding tax requirements will be valued at their Fair
Market Value on the date the tax withholding obligation arises (as such date is determined by PNC).     7.  Employment  . Neither
the granting of the Award nor any payment with respect to such Award authorized hereunder nor any term or provision of this Agreement shall constitute or be evidence of any understanding, expressed or implied, on the part of PNC to employ you for
any period or in any way alter your status as an employee at will.     8.  Miscellaneous  .

breach hereof will be brought exclusively in the Federal court for the Western District of Pennsylvania or in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. By execution of this Agreement, you and PNC hereby consent to the exclusive

Plan or as provided for in this Agreement. No other modification of the terms of this Agreement will be effective unless embodied in a separate, subsequent writing signed by you and by an authorized representative of PNC.  
 (e)  No Waiver . Failure of PNC to demand strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement will not be
deemed a waiver of such term, covenant or condition, nor will any waiver or relinquishment of any such term, covenant or condition on any occasion or on multiple occasions be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such term, covenant or condition.
 
      --5--  

(f)  Severability . The restrictions and obligations imposed by this Agreement are separate
and severable, and it is the intent of both parties that if any restriction or obligation imposed by any of these provisions is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void for any reason whatsoever, the remaining provisions, restrictions
and obligations will remain valid and binding upon you.    (g)  Compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code . It is

  PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS AWARD AGREEMENT   
   APPENDIX B    
   DEFINITIONS        Certain
Definitions  . Except as otherwise provided, the following definitions apply for purposes of the Agreement.       Anticipatory
Termination    means a termination of employment where PNC terminates your employment with PNC (other than for Misconduct or Disability) prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs, and you reasonably demonstrated that such
termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party that has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  
    Cause    means (a) your willful and continued failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by PNC that specifically identifies the manner in which it is believed that you have not substantially performed your
duties; (b) your material breach of (1) any code of conduct of PNC that is applicable to you or (2) other written policy of PNC that is applicable to you, in either case required by law or established to maintain compliance with
applicable law; (c) any act of fraud, misappropriation, material dishonesty, or embezzlement by you against PNC or any client or customer of PNC; (d) your conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) for, or entry into a
pre-trial disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony; or (e) entry of any order against you by any governmental body having regulatory authority with respect to the business of PNC that relates to or arises out of your employment
or other service relationship with PNC.    The cessation of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been a termination of your employment for Cause
for purposes of the Agreement only if and when PNC, by PNC s CEO or his or her designee (or, if you are the CEO, the Board, or if you are another  officer  of PNC, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act (and the rules
thereunder), the Board or the Committee), determines that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above or that an event described in clause (d) or (e) above has occurred with respect to you and, if so,
determines that the termination of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been for Cause.       CEO    means the chief
executive officer of PNC.  
      -i-  

Change of Control    means:    
 (a) Any Person becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either
(x) the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the   Outstanding PNC Common Stock  ) or (y) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of PNC entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(the   Outstanding PNC Voting Securities  ). The following acquisitions will not constitute a Change of Control for purposes of this definition: (1) any acquisition directly from PNC, (2) any acquisition by PNC, (3) any
acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by PNC or any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with PNC (an   Affiliated Company  ), (4) any acquisition pursuant to an
Excluded Combination (as defined below) or (5) an acquisition of beneficial ownership representing between 20% and 40%, inclusive, of the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities or Outstanding PNC Common Stock if the Incumbent Board (as defined
below) as of immediately prior to any such acquisition approves such acquisition either prior to or immediately after its occurrence;    (b)
Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the   Incumbent Board  ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board (excluding any Board seat that is vacant or otherwise unoccupied). For purposes
of this definition, any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of PNC, was approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered as though such individual was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;  
 (c) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar transaction involving PNC or any of its
subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PNC, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by PNC or any of its subsidiaries (each, a   Business Combination  ). A transaction
otherwise meeting the definition of Business Combination will not be treated as a Change of Control if following completion of the transaction all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding
PNC Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (or, for a non-corporate entity, equivalent securities) and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or, for a  non-corporate  entity, equivalent governing body), as the case may be, of the entity
resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns PNC or all or substantially all of PNC s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially
the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities, as the case may be (such a Business Combination, an   Excluded

promotion or organization of, any Person other than PNC (1) engaged in business activities similar to some or all of the business activities of PNC during your employment or (2) engaged in business activities that you know PNC intends to
enter within the next 12 months (or, if after your Termination Date, within the first 12 months after your Termination Date), in either case whether you are acting as agent, consultant, independent contractor, employee, officer, director, investor,
partner, shareholder, proprietor or in any other individual or representative capacity therein. For purposes of Competitive Activity as defined herein (and as such similar term is defined in any equity-based award agreement held by you), the term
 subsidiary  will not include any company in which PNC holds an interest pursuant to its merchant banking authority.       Detrimental
Conduct    means:    (a) You have engaged in, without the prior written consent of PNC (with consent to be given or withheld at
PNC s sole discretion), in any Competitive Activity in the Restricted Territory at any time during the period of your employment with PNC and the 12-month period following your Termination Date;  
 (b) any act of fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement by you against PNC or one of its subsidiaries or any client or customer of PNC or one
of its subsidiaries; or    (c) you are convicted (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) of, or you enter into a pre-trial
disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony that relates to or arises out of your employment or other service relationship with PNC.  
 You will be deemed to have engaged in Detrimental Conduct for purposes of the Agreement only if and when the Committee or other PNC Designated
Person determines that you have engaged in conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above or that an event described in clause (c) above has occurred with respect to you. Detrimental Conduct will not apply to conduct by or
activities of successors to the Award by will or the laws of descent and distribution in the event of your death.    No determination that
you have engaged in Detrimental Conduct may be made (x) on or after your Termination Date if your termination of employment was an Anticipatory Termination or (y) between the time PNC enters into an agreement providing for a Change of
Control and the time such agreement either terminates or results in a Change of Control.       Disabled   or
  Disability    means that you either (i) are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be
expected to last for a  
      -iii-  

continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) are, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to
last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving (and have received for at least three months) income replacement benefits under any PNC-sponsored disability benefit plan. If you have been determined to be eligible for U.S. Social
Security disability benefits, you will be presumed to be Disabled as defined herein.       Effective Date    has the meaning set forth
in Section A of the Agreement.       Fair Market Value    as it relates to a share of Common Stock as of any given date means
(a) the reported closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (or such successor reporting system as PNC may select) for a share of Common Stock on such date, or, if no Common Stock trades have been reported on such exchange for that day, such
closing price on the preceding day for which there were reported trades or, if the Committee has so acted, (b) fair market value as determined using such other reasonable method adopted by the Committee in good faith for such purpose that uses
actual transactions in PNC common stock as reported by a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, provided that such method is consistently applied. When determining Fair Market Value under this Award or any currently outstanding
award under the Plan you hold, the Fair Market Value will be rounded to the nearest cent.          Good Reason    means the
definition of Good Reason contained in the Change of Control Employment Agreement between you and PNC or any substitute employment agreement entered into between you and PNC then in effect or, if none, the occurrence of any of the following events
without your consent:    (a) the assignment to of any duties to you inconsistent in any material respect with your position (including
status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), or any other material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities;  
 (b) any material reduction in your rate of base salary or the amount of your annual bonus opportunity (or, if less, the bonus opportunity
established for the PNC s similarly situated employees for any year), or a material reduction in the level of any other employee benefits for which you are eligible receive below those offered to the PNC s similarly situated employees;
   (c) PNC s requiring you to be based at any office or location outside of a fifty (50)-mile radius from the office where you were
employed on the Grant Date;    (d) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the PNC of any agreement entered into
between you and PNC; or    (e) the failure by PNC to require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of PNC to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PNC would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place.  
      -iv-  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the events described above shall constitute Good Reason
unless and until (i) you first notify PNC in writing describing in reasonable detail the condition which constitutes Good Reason within 90 days of its initial occurrence, (ii) PNC fails to cure such condition within 30 days after receipt
of such written notice, and (iii) you terminate employment within two years of its initial occurrence.    Your mental or physical
incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (a) through (e) shall not affect your ability to terminate employment for Good Reason, and your death following delivery of a notice of termination for Good Reason
shall not affect your estate s entitlement to severance payments benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.  
    Misconduct    means, as it relates to an Anticipatory Termination or following a Change of Control, (a) your willful and continued
failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the CEO that
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the CEO believes that you have not substantially performed your duties; or (b) your willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious
to PNC or any of its subsidiaries. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on your part, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by you in bad faith and without reasonable belief that your
action or omission was in the best interests of PNC. Any act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or prior approval of the Board, the CEO or your superior or based upon the advice of counsel for PNC, will be conclusively presumed to be
done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of PNC.    Your cessation of employment will be deemed to be a termination of
your employment with PNC for Misconduct only if and when there shall have been delivered to you, as part of the notice of your termination, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire
membership of the Board, at a Board meeting called and held for the purpose of considering such termination, finding on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of conduct described in
clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such resolution shall be adopted only after (i) reasonable notice of such Board meeting is provided to you, together with written notice
that PNC believes that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (ii) you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard
before the Board.  
      -v-

Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act .        PNC    has one of the following meanings, depending on the context

divestiture) on or after the first date on which you have both attained at least age 55 and completed five years of service, where a year of service is determined in the same manner as the determination of a year of vesting service calculated under
the provisions of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan.       Termination Date    means the last day of your employment
with PNC. If you are employed by a Consolidated Subsidiary that ceases to be a subsidiary of PNC or ceases to be a consolidated subsidiary of PNC under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and you do not continue to be employed by or

   The Award is divided into four Tranches, with the first Tranche relating to the 2016 performance year, the second Tranche relating to the
2017 performance year, and so on.       Performance-based vesting and calculation of
related payout for each outstanding Tranche is adjusted based on three separate annual performance metrics, described below:     
       Each Tranche of the Award will be subject to an annual corporate performance factor
that relates to corporate total shareholder return (TSR) for that year.     
       Each Tranche of the Award will be subject to an annual Tier 1 risk-based performance
factor based on whether, as of the year-end immediately preceding the applicable vesting date for that tranche, PNC has met or exceeded the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for
well-capitalized institutions (as then in effect and applicable to PNC).     
       Each Tranche of the Award will be subject to a second annual risk review performance
factor relating to PNC s return on economic capital (ROEC), as defined in paragraph 4 below, relative to the applicable Committee-specified risk performance hurdle for that year for purposes of
comparison.    
      -1-  

2.  
    
    Corporate Performance  
  Factor   
    
   The   Annual Corporate Performance Factor   means 100.00%, plus or minus PNC s one-year total shareholder return (TSR)
for the year to which the Tranche relates. For this Award, TSR is the total shareholder return (i.e., price change plus reinvestment of dividends) on a share of PNC Common Stock for the applicable calendar year, assuming an investment on the first
day of the year is held through the last day of the applicable year based on the closing price on the last trading day of the preceding year and on the last trading day of the applicable year, respectively. 
     PNC will present information to the Committee with respect to PNC s level of TSR
Performance for a given performance year following the end of that calendar year. The process of certification of the level of PNC s TSR Performance with respect to a given performance year will generally occur in late January or early February
after the applicable year end date.        Calculation . Except as set forth in
paragraph 6 below, the Annual Corporate Performance Factor for a Tranche will be 100.00% plus or minus (as applicable) the positive or negative TSR performance of PNC for the year that relates to that Tranche, up to a maximum of 25 percentage points
in either direction (i.e., it will range between 75.00% and 125.00% of the number of outstanding PRSUs in a Tranche). The Annual Corporate Performance Factor will be calculated to two places to the right of the decimal, rounded to the nearest
..01.   

3.  
    
    1 st  Risk  
  Performance  
  Factor   
    
   The  Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor  for a Tranche means either (x) 100.00% if, as of the applicable performance
measurement date for that Tranche, PNC has met or exceeded the required Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to
PNC, or (y) 0.00%, if PNC has not met or exceeded such required ratio.     
  Determination of Risk Performance Metric . As soon as practicable after the applicable performance measurement date, PNC will present information to the
Committee with respect to (1) the minimum specified Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio PNC is required to achieve in order to meet the required Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company
regulator    
      -2-  

for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to PNC and (2) the applicable Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
achieved by PNC with respect to the Tranche based on PNC s publicly reported financial results for the period ending on the applicable year-end date (or other performance measurement date). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6 below in
the event of your death or a Change of Control, this will generally be the public release of earnings results for PNC s fourth quarter that occurs after the year-end measurement date, so that the Committee will be able to make its determination
in late January or early February following the applicable performance year-end.       The
Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor applies separately to each Tranche, and if this performance condition is not met, that Tranche is forfeited as set forth in Section C.3.   
 
   4.  
    
    2 nd  Risk  
  Performance  
  Factor   
    
       The ROEC-related risk metric serves as a trigger to determine
whether or not a risk performance review and potential downward adjustment by the Committee is required. Independent from the ROEC-related risk metric, the Committee also has the discretion to conduct a risk performance review. Any determination to
conduct a risk performance review will be made shortly after the close of the applicable year, but no later than the 45 th  day following the close of such year. 
     The  ROEC hurdle  for a given risk performance year is the risk performance
hurdle specified by the Committee (no later than March 30th of that performance year) for purposes of comparison of ROEC to such hurdle. The hurdle is related to PNC s cost of capital, and is set at a level at which the Committee believes
ROEC performance below that level for the year could be an indication of a possibly inappropriate level of risk and therefore warrant a risk performance review by the Committee. 
     If a review is triggered based on PNC s ROEC relative to the applicable ROEC hurdle
for a given performance year, or if the Committee requires a review in its discretion, the Committee determines a risk review performance factor with respect to each Tranche (the   Annual Risk Review Performance Factor  ), as
follows:    
      -3-  

As soon as practicable, the Committee will conduct a review to
determine if a downward-adjustment for risk performance is appropriate and, if so, the size of that adjustment.   

Using a sliding scale and other principles as guidelines, together with Committee
discretion, the Committee determines the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor.     
       The Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for a given year and Tranche may range from
0.00% to 100.00% (where a factor less than 100.00% reflects a downward adjustment of the payout size of the Tranche).     
 If no review is conducted with respect to that year or if the Committee determines not to apply a downward adjustment for risk performance to a Tranche, the
Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for that year will be 100.00%.        ROEC 
for a given performance year will be calculated as earnings for the applicable performance year, divided by average economic capital for the same calendar year, calculated to two places to the right of the decimal, rounded to the nearest hundredth,
and where  earnings  and  economic capital  have the following meanings:     
  Earnings  will mean PNC s publicly-reported earnings for the applicable calendar year adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of the
items set forth below:     
       items resulting from a change in tax law; 
           discontinued
operations (as such term is used under GAAP);     
       acquisition costs and merger integration costs; 
           any costs or
expense arising from specified Visa litigation (including Visa-litigation-related expenses/charges recorded for obligations to Visa with respect to the costs of specified litigation or the gains/reversal of expense recognized in connection with such
obligations) and any other gains recognized on the redemption or sale of Visa shares as applicable;    
      -4-  

acceleration of the accretion of any remaining issuance discount
in connection with the redemption of any preferred stock, and any other charges or benefits related to the redemption of trust preferred or other preferred securities; and     
       the net impact on PNC of significant gains or losses related to BlackRock
transactions.        Economic capital  means total economic capital for PNC on a
consolidated basis as that term is used by PNC for its internal measurement purposes, and average economic capital for the applicable calendar year will mean such average economic capital as calculated by PNC for internal purposes. 
      For the 2016 performance year, the Committee-approved ROEC hurdle level is related to
PNC s cost of capital and is set at 7.43%.    

5.  
    
  Prospective Adjustments; Committee Determinations  
    
 The Committee may make prospective adjustments to the Award to the extent such adjustments would not cause the loss of a deduction under Code Section 162(m). All determinations made by the Committee or otherwise by PNC hereunder
shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties.  

6.  
    
  Determination of Performance Factors Upon Death or a Change of Control   

Death 
    
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your employment with PNC ceases by reason of your death, or if you die after a termination of employment with PNC due to Disability or Retirement or by reason of an
Anticipatory Termination, in any case, prior to a Change of Control or any Scheduled Vesting Date(s), then all performance-based vesting requirements will be met with respect to the outstanding unvested portion of your Award, and such portion will
payable based on 100% performance for the Annual Corporate Performance Factor, the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor and the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor (unless the date of death occurs after a calendar year but prior to
performance-adjustment by the Committee for a given Tranche, in which case such Tranche will vest based on actual performance as determined by the Committee).   
      -5-  

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of your death following a Change of Control, the Annual Corporate and Risk Performance Factors for any then outstanding Tranche will be determined as provided in the  Change of
Control  paragraph below.  

Change of Control 
    
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to your satisfaction of the service-based vesting requirements, any
outstanding Tranches for which no performance factors have been determined at the time of a Change of Control will be performance-adjusted, as follows:     
       For the Annual Corporate Performance Factor, based on 100% performance for each
Tranche.             For
the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor, by determining the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor using the quarter-end date immediately preceding the Change of Control (or if the Change of Control falls on a quarter-end date, and such
information is available and applicable for such date, the date of the Change of Control) as the applicable  performance measurement date  for each outstanding Tranche. 
           For the Annual
Risk Review Performance Factor, based on the last Annual Risk Review Performance Factor applicable prior to the Change of Control (or, if none, then 100.00%) for each Tranche.     
 For the avoidance of doubt:     
       If the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor was not met as of the applicable
quarter-end performance measurement date, or if the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor was 0.00%, the Award will be forfeited by you as of the Change of Control.     
       Tranches that remain outstanding will be paid out, without further Dividend Equivalents
or any interest, on the Scheduled Vesting Dates (or earlier, in the event of your death) upon your satisfaction of the service-based vesting requirements.     
       If a Change of Control occurs after your death, and the date of death occurs after a
calendar year but prior to performance-adjustment by the Committee for a given Tranche, such Tranche will vest based on actual performance as determined by the    
      -6-  

Committee if such Committee determination was made as of the date immediately preceding the date of the Change of Control. If no Committee determination was made as of the date immediately preceding the Change of Control, then
the Annual Corporate Performance Factor, the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor and the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for such Tranche will be determined as set forth in this  Change of Control  subparagraph.  

7.  
    
  Determination of Payout Share Units  
    
     Payout Share Units   means the performance-adjusted number of PRSUs in a Tranche that are eligible to vest. With respect
to each Tranche, the calculation of Payout Share Units is determined as follows (with all percentages rounded to the nearest .01):     
       The Annual Corporate Performance Factor is first determined for the performance year
related to that Tranche (ranging from 0.00% to 125.00%).     
       The Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor for that same Tranche (either 0.00% or
100%) is then applied to the Annual Corporate Performance Factor.     
       If the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor is 0.00%, the award is forfeited and
cancelled as set forth in Section C.3.     
       If the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor is 100.00%, then the Annual Risk
Review Performance Factor will be applied to the Tranche.     
       The Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for that same Tranche (ranging from 0.00% to
100.00%) is then applied to the Annual Corporate Performance Factor to generate the overall   Annual Performance Factor   for the Tranche (ranging from 0.00% to 125.00%). 
           The number of
Payout Share Units for that Tranche is calculated by applying the Annual Performance Factor as a percentage of the initial outstanding PRSUs in a Tranche, rounded down to the nearest whole unit.

greatest limitations considered enforceable by the court.    v.  Waiver of Jury Trial . Each of you and PNC hereby
waives any right to trial by jury with regard to any suit, action or proceeding under or in connection with any of Sections 1(a) 1(c).  
  2.    Capital Adjustments  . 
 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2(b), if applicable, if any corporate transactions such as stock dividends, stock splits,

its delegate shall make those adjustments, if any, in the number, class or kind of IPUs and related Dividend Equivalents then outstanding under the Award that it deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect the Corporate Transaction such that your
rights are neither enlarged nor diminished as a result of such Corporate Transaction, including without limitation (i) measuring the value per share unit of any share-denominated award amount authorized for payment to you by reference to the per
share value of the consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction and (ii) with respect to stock-payable IPUs only, authorizing payment of the entire value of any award amount authorized for payment
to you to be paid in cash at the applicable time specified in this Agreement. All determinations hereunder will be made by the Committee or its delegate in its sole discretion and will be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all

Award will automatically be adjusted to reflect the same changes as are made to outstanding shares of Common Stock generally, (ii) the value per share unit of any share-denominated award amount will be measured by reference to the per share value of
the consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction or Transactions if applicable, and (iii) with respect to stock-payable IPUs only, if the effect of the Corporate Transaction or Transactions on a
holder of Common Stock is to convert that shareholder s holdings into consideration that does not consist solely (other than as to a minimal amount) of shares of Common Stock, then the entire value of any payment to be made to you will be made
solely in cash at the applicable time specified in this Agreement.     3.  Fractional Shares  . No fractional Shares will be
delivered to you. If the outstanding vested IPUs being settled in Shares include a fractional interest, such fractional interest will be eliminated by rounding down to the nearest whole share unit.

   DEFINITIONS        Certain
Definitions  . Except as otherwise provided, the following definitions apply for purposes of the Agreement.       Anticipatory
Termination    means a termination of employment where PNC terminates your employment with PNC (other than for Misconduct or Disability) prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs, and you reasonably demonstrated that such
termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party that has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  
      Cause      means (a) your willful and continued failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such
failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by PNC that specifically identifies the manner in which it is believed that you have not substantially
performed your duties; (b) your material breach of (1) any code of conduct of PNC that is applicable to you or (2) other written policy of PNC that is applicable to you, in either case required by law or established to maintain compliance with
applicable law; (c) any act of fraud, misappropriation, material dishonesty, or embezzlement by you against PNC or any client or customer of PNC; (d) your conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) for, or entry into a pre-trial
disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony; or (e) entry of any order against you by any governmental body having regulatory authority with respect to the business of PNC that relates to or arises out of your employment or other service
relationship with PNC.    The cessation of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been a termination of your employment for Cause for purposes of
the Agreement only if and when PNC, by PNC s CEO or his or her designee (or, if you are the CEO, the Board, or if you are another  officer  of PNC, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act (and the rules thereunder), the Board or
the Committee), determines that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above or that an event described in clause (d) or (e) above has occurred with respect to you and, if so, determines that the termination of your employment
with PNC will be deemed to have been for Cause.         CEO      means the chief executive officer of PNC.  
      i  

Change of Control      means:  
 (a) Any Person becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (x)
the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the   Outstanding PNC Common Stock  ) or (y) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of PNC entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the
  Outstanding PNC Voting Securities  ). The following acquisitions will not constitute a Change of Control for purposes of this definition: (1) any acquisition directly from PNC, (2) any acquisition by PNC, (3) any acquisition by
any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by PNC or any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with PNC (an   Affiliated Company  ), (4) any acquisition pursuant to an Excluded

who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the   Incumbent Board  ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board (excluding any Board seat that is vacant or otherwise unoccupied). For purposes of this
definition, any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of PNC, was approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered as though such individual was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;  
 (c) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar transaction involving PNC or any of its
subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PNC, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by PNC or any of its subsidiaries (each, a   Business Combination  ). A transaction
otherwise meeting the definition of Business Combination will not be treated as a Change of Control if following completion of the transaction all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding
PNC Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (or, for a non-corporate entity, equivalent securities) and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or, for a  non-corporate  entity, equivalent governing body), as the case may be, of the entity
resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns PNC or all or substantially all of PNC s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially
the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities, as the case may be (such a Business Combination, an   Excluded

enter within the next 12 months (or, if after your Termination Date, within the first 12 months after your Termination Date), in either case whether you are acting as agent, consultant, independent contractor, employee, officer, director, investor,
partner, shareholder, proprietor or in any other individual or representative capacity therein. For purposes of Competitive Activity as defined herein (and as such similar term is defined in any equity-based award agreement held by you), the term
 subsidiary  will not include any company in which PNC holds an interest pursuant to its merchant banking authority.       Detrimental
Conduct    means:    (a) You have engaged in, without the prior written consent of PNC (with consent to be given or withheld at
PNC s sole discretion), in any Competitive Activity in the Restricted Territory at any time during the period of your employment with PNC and the 12-month period following your Termination Date;  
 (b) any act of fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement by you against PNC or one of its subsidiaries or any client or customer of PNC or one
of its subsidiaries; or    (c) you are convicted (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) of, or you enter into a pre-trial
disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony that relates to or arises out of your employment or other service relationship with PNC.  
 You will be deemed to have engaged in Detrimental Conduct for purposes of the Agreement only if and when the Committee or other PNC Designated
Person determines that you have engaged in conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above or that an event described in clause (c) above has occurred with respect to you. Detrimental Conduct will not apply to conduct by or activities of
successors to the Award by will or the laws of descent and distribution in the event of your death.   No determination that you have engaged
in Detrimental Conduct may be made (x) on or after your Termination Date if your termination of employment was an Anticipatory Termination or (y) between the time PNC enters into an agreement providing for a Change of Control and the time such
agreement either terminates or results in a Change of Control.  
      iii  

Disabled     or     Disability      means that you
either (i) are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12
months, or (ii) are, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving (and have received for at
least three months) income replacement benefits under any PNC-sponsored disability benefit plan. If you have been determined to be eligible for U.S. Social Security disability benefits, you will be presumed to be Disabled as defined herein.

Stock Exchange (or such successor reporting system as PNC may select) for a share of Common Stock on such date, or, if no Common Stock trades have been reported on such exchange for that day, such closing price on the preceding day for which there

national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, provided that such method is consistently applied. When determining Fair Market Value under this Award or any currently outstanding award under the Plan you hold, the Fair Market Value
will be rounded to the nearest cent.       Final Award Date    means (a) the date on which the Committee makes its determination as to
the size of the payout of a Final Award (defined in  Appendix C ), if any, following the end of the Performance Period, (b) in the event of your death prior to the last calendar year of the Performance Period, the date on which the Committee
makes its determination as to the size of the payout of a Final Award, if any, following the calendar year of your death, or (c) if a Change of Control has occurred prior to the date described in (a) and a Final Award has been authorized, the date
upon which the service requirements are satisfied.         Good Reason      means the definition of Good Reason contained in
the Change of Control Employment Agreement between you and PNC or any substitute employment agreement entered into between you and PNC then in effect or, if none, the occurrence of any of the following events without your consent:  
 (a) the assignment to of any duties to you inconsistent in any material respect with your position (including status, offices, titles and
reporting requirements), or any other material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities;    (b) any material
reduction in your rate of base salary or the amount of your annual bonus opportunity (or, if less, the bonus opportunity established for the PNC s similarly situated employees for any year), or a material reduction in the level of any other
employee benefits for which you are eligible receive below those offered to the PNC s similarly situated employees;  
      iv  

(c) PNC s requiring you to be based at any office or location outside of a fifty (50)-mile
radius from the office where you were employed on the Grant Date;    (d) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the
PNC of any agreement entered into between you and PNC; or    (e) the failure by PNC to require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of PNC to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PNC would be required to perform it
if no such succession had taken place.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the events described above shall constitute Good Reason
unless and until (i) you first notify PNC in writing describing in reasonable detail the condition which constitutes Good Reason within 90 days of its initial occurrence, (ii) PNC fails to cure such condition within 30 days after receipt of such
written notice, and (iii) you terminate employment within two years of its initial occurrence.   Your mental or physical incapacity
following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (a) through (e) shall not affect your ability to terminate employment for Good Reason, and your death following delivery of a notice of termination for Good Reason shall not
affect your estate s entitlement to severance payments benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.  
    Misconduct    means, as it relates to an Anticipatory Termination or following a Change of Control, (a) your willful and continued
failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the CEO that
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the CEO believes that you have not substantially performed your duties; or (b) your willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to
PNC or any of its subsidiaries. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on your part, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by you in bad faith and without reasonable belief that your
action or omission was in the best interests of PNC. Any act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or prior approval of the Board, the CEO or your superior or based upon the advice of counsel for PNC, will be conclusively presumed to
be done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of PNC.    Your cessation of employment will be deemed to be a termination of
your employment with PNC for Misconduct only if and when there shall have been delivered to you, as part  
      v  

of the notice of your termination, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board, at a Board meeting called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination, finding on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case,
specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such resolution shall be adopted only after (i) reasonable notice of such Board meeting is provided to you, together with written notice that PNC believes that you are guilty of conduct described in
clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (ii) you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board.

determines prior to such divestiture) on or after the first date on which you  
      vi

THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.   
  2006 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN   
  INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE UNITS AWARD AGREEMENT   
   APPENDIX C    
  PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS     The
following table sets forth the performance-based vesting conditions of the Award:      

1.  
    
  Generally  
    
   Performance-based vesting and payout of your Award is determined based on the level of satisfaction of four performance metrics during
each Performance Year, described in more detail in the paragraphs below.       Each
performance metric is applied to the Award on an annual basis for each calendar year (i.e., calendar year 2016, calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018) during the Performance Period (each, a   Performance Year  ). A
Performance Year may refer to a partial calendar year in certain limited circumstances (e.g., in connection with death or a Change of Control) as described in this  Appendix C . 
           Two of the four
performance metrics are related to annual corporate performance:     
       annual growth in earnings per share (EPS Growth) relative to similar performance of
PNC s Peer Group (as set forth in paragraph 2 below) for the applicable Performance Year, and     
       annual return on average common shareholders  equity (ROCE) for the applicable
Performance Year relative to the applicable Committee-specified ROCE hurdle for that year.     
       The other two performance metrics are related to annual risk performance: 
           whether, as of the
end of a given Performance Year, PNC has met or exceeded the Tier 1 risk based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to PNC,
and    
      -1-  

PNC s return on economic capital (ROEC), as defined in
paragraph 5 below, relative to the applicable Committee-specified  ROEC hurdle  for that year for purposes of comparison.     
 Each performance metric generates an annual  performance factor  for a given Performance Year, which are aggregated and applied to the Award, as set
forth in subsequent paragraphs, to calculate the maximum number of IPUs eligible to vest under the Award.     
         Payout Share Units   refers to the performance-adjusted number of IPUs
that are eligible to vest.     
       The amount of Payout Share Units authorized by the Committee to be paid out to you in
accordance with this Agreement is the   Final Award .    

2.  
    
    1 st  Corporate Performance  
  Factor   
    
    (a) EPS Growth Generally . The Award is subject to a corporate performance factor that relates to annual EPS Growth relative to
similar performance of PNC s Peer Group for the applicable Performance Year, where:     
           EPS  means the publicly-reported diluted earnings per
share of PNC or other Peer Group members for the Performance Year, in each case as adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of the items set forth in paragraph 6 below (rounded to the nearest cent), and 
             
 EPS Growth,  with respect to a given Performance Year, means the growth or decline in EPS achieved by PNC or other Peer Group member for that Performance Year as compared to EPS for the comparable period of the prior calendar year,
expressed as a percentage (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth).        (b) Calculating
Annual EPS Growth Performance Facto r. After measuring EPS Growth for PNC and its Peer Group for a Performance Year, PNC and its Peer Group will be ranked for that Performance Year based on their respective EPS growth performances, adjusted
as set forth in paragraph 6 below.       When ranking EPS growth performance for a given
Performance Year for PNC and members of its Peer    
      -2-  

Group, each Peer Group member that had positive adjusted earnings will be ranked  above  any Peer that had a loss (i.e., negative
adjusted earnings) for (i) the same period, or (ii) that covered period or the comparable period of the comparison year.     
 The   Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor   is generated for a given Performance Year using the applicable table and interpolation, as set
forth in  Exhibit 1  to this  Appendix C . The Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor will depend both on PNC s relative ranking achieved with respect to EPS Growth and on PNC s performance for EPS Growth relative to the
comparable performance of the Peer Group member ranking immediately above and below PNC during the Performance Year.     
 The Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor for the given Performance Year is the applicable unadjusted payout percentage in the table, adjusted as indicated in
the footnotes to that table, and rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. The Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor will range from 0.00% - 125.00%.     
  (c) Committee Negative Discretion . Once the Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor for a given Performance Year has been determined, the Committee
may decide, in its discretion, to reduce that percentage (as long as such decision is not made during a Change of Control Coverage Period, as defined in paragraph 11, or after the occurrence of a Change of Control) but may not increase such
percentage.        (d) Peer Group . The Peer Group is determined by the Committee and
may be reset by the Committee annually but no later than the 90th day of that year.     
       EPS growth performance measurements for a Performance Year will be made with respect to
the members of the Peer Group as they exist on the last day of that Performance Year taking into account name changes and the elimination from the Peer Group of any members since the beginning of the year (e.g., due to consolidation or merger). 
     Unless and until reset prospectively by the Committee, the Peer Group will consist of the
following members:    
      -3-  

PNC; BB T Corporation; Bank of America Corporation; Capital One
Financial, Inc.; Fifth Third Bancorp; JPMorgan Chase; KeyCorp; M T Bank; Regions Financial Corporation; SunTrust Banks, Inc.; U.S. Bancorp; and Wells Fargo   Co.   

3.  
    
    2 nd  Corporate Performance  
  Factor   
    
    (a) ROCE Generally.    The Award is subject to a second corporate performance factor that relates to the publicly-reported
return on average common shareholders  equity of PNC for a given Performance Year, as adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of the items set forth in paragraph 6, as applicable to ROCE (  ROCE  ). 
      (b) Calculating Annual ROCE-Related Performance Facto r. ROCE for a given
Performance Year is compared to the applicable Committee-specified  ROCE hurdle  measured in each of the Performance Years. The Committee will establish the ROCE hurdle with respect to a Performance Year no later than March 30 th  of that Performance Year. For the 2016 Performance Year, the ROCE hurdle as approved by the Committee is related to PNC s cost of common equity and is set at 6.97%. 
     The   Annual ROCE-Related Performance Factor   is generated using the
table set forth in  Exhibit 2  to this Appendix C by measuring the level of PNC s ROCE performance for a given Performance Year and comparing this amount to the Committee-specified ROCE hurdle level for that calendar year. (ROCE
performance, expressed as a percentage of the applicable ROCE hurdle level, is rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.) The Annual ROCE-Related Performance Factor will be the applicable payout percentage in the table, interpolating the
percentages for performance between the points indicated on the table and adjusted as indicated in the footnotes to that table, then rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.     
 The Annual ROCE-Related Performance Factor will range from 0.00%   125.00%.     
  (c) Committee Negative Discretion . Once the Annual ROCE-Related Performance Factor for a given Performance Year has been determined, the Committee
may decide, in its discretion, to reduce that percentage (as long as such decision is not made during a Change of Control Coverage Period or after the occurrence of a Change of Control) but may not increase
it.

4.  
    
    1 st  Risk  
  Performance  
  Factor   
    
    (a) Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Generally . The Award is subject to an annual risk performance factor based on whether, as of
the last day of a given Performance Year, PNC has met or exceeded the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to
PNC.        (b) Determination of Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance
Factor . For each Performance Year, as soon as practicable after the applicable performance measurement date, PNC will present information to the Committee reflecting (1) the minimum specified Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio PNC is required
to achieve in order to meet the required Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to PNC as compared to (2) the
applicable Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio achieved by PNC with respect to that Performance Year, based on PNC s publicly reported financial results for the period ending on the applicable end date. Except as otherwise provided in
paragraph 10 below, this will generally be the public release of earnings results for PNC s fourth quarter that occurs after the year-end measurement date, so that the Committee will be able to make its determination in late January or early
February following the applicable performance year-end.       The   Annual Tier 1
Risk-Based Performance Factor   for a Performance Year means either (x) 100.00% if, as of the applicable performance measurement date for that Performance Year, PNC has met or exceeded the required Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio established
by PNC s primary Federal bank holding company regulator for well-capitalized institutions as then in effect and applicable to PNC, or (y) 0.00%, if PNC has not met or exceeded such required ratio. The Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance
Factor applies separately to each Performance Year.    
      -5-  

5.  
    
    2 nd  Risk  
  Performance  
  Factor   
    
    (a) ROEC Generally . The Award is subject to a second annual risk performance factor based on PNC s return on economic
capital ( ROEC ), as defined below, relative to the  ROEC hurdle,  as defined below, for a given Performance Year.     
       The ROEC-related risk metric serves as a trigger to determine whether or not a risk
performance review and potential downward adjustment by the Committee is required for a given Performance Year.     
       Independent from the ROEC-related risk metric, the Committee also has the discretion to
conduct a risk performance review.     
       Any determination to conduct a risk performance review will be made shortly after the
close of the applicable year, but no later than the 45 th  day following the close of such year.     
  ROEC  for a given Performance Year will be calculated as earnings for the applicable performance year, divided by average economic capital for the
same calendar year, calculated to two places to the right of the decimal, rounded to the nearest hundredth, where:     
        earnings  means PNC s publicly-reported earnings for the applicable
calendar year adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of the items in paragraph 6 below, and     
        economic capital  means total economic capital for PNC on a consolidated
basis as that term is used by PNC for its internal measurement purposes, and average economic capital for the applicable calendar year will mean such average economic capital as calculated by PNC for internal purposes. 
     The  ROEC hurdle  for a given risk performance year is the risk performance
hurdle specified by the Committee (no later than March 30th of that performance year) for purposes of comparison of ROEC to such hurdle.     
       The hurdle is related to PNC s cost of capital, and is set at a level at which the
Committee believes ROEC performance below that level for the year could be an indication of a possibly inappropriate level of risk and therefore warrant a risk performance review by the Committee. 
      (b) Determination of Annual Risk Review Performance Factor . If a review is
triggered based on PNC s ROEC    
      -6-  

relative to the applicable ROEC hurdle for a given Performance Year, or if the Committee requires a review in its discretion, the
Committee determines a risk review performance factor with respect to each Performance Year (the   Annual Risk Review Performance Factor  ), as follows:     
          The Committee will conduct a review to determine if a
downward-adjustment for risk performance is appropriate and, if so, the size of that adjustment.     
          The review is conducted no later than the end of the first quarter
following the close of the Performance Year.     
          Using a sliding scale and other principles as guidelines, together
with Committee discretion, the Committee determines the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor.     
 If no review is conducted with respect to that Performance Year or if the Committee determines not to apply a downward adjustment for risk performance for that
Performance Year, the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for that year will be 100.00%.     
 The Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for a given Performance Year may range from 0.00% to 100.00% (where a factor less than 100.00% reflects a downward
adjustment for risk performance).        For the 2016 performance year, the
Committee-approved ROEC hurdle level is related to PNC s cost of capital and is set at 7.43%.    

6. 
    
    Adjustments to Performance  
  Factors   
    
 For purposes of measuring EPS growth performance for PNC and the members of the Peer Group for purposes of paragraph 2, measuring PNC s ROCE (return on average common shareholders  equity) for purposes of paragraph 3,
and measuring PNC s ROEC (return on economic capital) for purposes of paragraph 5, publicly-reported earnings or EPS performance results, as applicable, will be adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of any of the following where such
impact occurs during a given Performance Year or, where applicable for purposes of the EPS growth metric, during the prior year comparison period for a given year:   
      -7-  

items resulting from a change in tax law; 
           discontinued
operations (as such term is used under GAAP);     
       acquisition costs and merger integration costs; 
           any costs or
expense arising from specified Visa litigation (including Visa-litigation-related expenses/charges recorded for obligations to Visa with respect to the costs of specified litigation or the gains/reversal of expense recognized in connection with such
obligations) and any other gains recognized on the redemption or sale of Visa shares as applicable;     
       acceleration of the accretion of any remaining issuance discount in connection with the
redemption of any preferred stock, and any other charges or benefits related to the redemption of trust preferred or other preferred securities;     
       and, in PNC s case, the net impact on PNC of significant gains or losses related
to BlackRock transactions.       In the case of the relative EPS growth metric, there will
be an additional adjustment for the impact of any stock splits (whether in the form of a stock split or a stock dividend). In the case of the ROCE performance metric, there will be an additional adjustment for the impact of any goodwill. 
     All of these adjustments will be made, with respect to both PNC and, where applicable,
the Peer Group (or members of the Peer Group), on the basis of, and only where such amounts can be reasonably determined from, publicly-disclosed financial information. After-tax adjustments for PNC and, where applicable, the Peer Group (or
members of the Peer Group) will be calculated using the same methodology for making such adjustments on an after-tax basis.     
 The Committee may also take into account other adjustments applied on a consistent basis but only if the effect of such adjustment or adjustments would be to
reduce the maximum Payout Share Units amounts prior to making its Final Award payout determinations.   

7. 
    
  Negative Discretion  
    
 The Committee may exercise negative discretion with respect to the Award and may determine, in light of PNC   
      -8-  

or individual performance or other factors as the Committee may deem appropriate, that notwithstanding the levels of corporate and risk
performance achieved by PNC, the Committee will not award you the full maximum Payout Share Units eligible for authorization.     
       The Committee may use its negative discretion to reduce the size of the Final Award or
to cancel the full applicable potential award amount.     
       The Committee will have no discretion to reduce the maximum Payout Share Units
following a Change of Control or during a Change of Control Coverage Period.     
       In the event (a) your termination of employment with PNC is an Anticipatory
Termination, (b) a Change of Control is pending, and (c) the Committee-determined Final Award Date occurs prior to the Change of Control, the Committee will have no discretion to reduce your calculated maximum Payout Share Units under these
circumstances.   

8. 
    
    Committee  
  Certification of  
  Annual     Performance;
Prospective Adjustments; Committee     Discretion   
    
   The process of certification of the level of PNC s performance by the Committee with respect to the Performance Period will generally
occur in late January or early February after the applicable  year-end  date.     
 The Committee may make prospective adjustments to the Award to the extent such adjustments would not cause the loss of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code. All determinations made by the Committee or otherwise by PNC hereunder shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties.   

9. 
    
    Calculation of  
  Payout Share Units     and
Determination     of Final Award   
    
    (a) Determination of Annual Performance Factors and Overall Performance Factor.  The Annual Performance Factors and Overall
Performance Factor are determined as follows (subject to the provisions of paragraph 10 below in the event of your death or a Change of Control):     
 1.      First, the Annual EPS Growth Performance Factor and the Annual ROCE-Related
Performance Factor are averaged for a given Performance Year to generate an    
      -9-  

Annual Corporate Performance Factor   for that Performance Year, which is the maximum  Annual
Performance Factor  for a given Performance Year (not to exceed 125.00%).     
 2.      Next, the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor (either 0.00% or 100%) is
then applied to the Annual Corporate Performance Factor.     
 a.      If the applicable Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor is 100.00%, then
the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for the same Performance Year (ranging from 0.00% to 100.00%) will be applied for that Performance Year.     
 b.      If the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor, the overall Annual
Performance Factor (defined below) for that Performance Year is 0.00%.     
 3.      The Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for that Performance Year (ranging
from 0.00% to 100.00%) is then applied to the revised Annual Corporate Performance Factor to generate the overall   Annual Performance Factor   for the Tranche (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth and ranging from 0.00% to
125.00%).     
 a.      If the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor is 0.00%, the overall Annual
Performance Factor for that Performance Year is 0.00%.     
 4.      After certification of performance results by the Committee, the
  Overall Performance Factor   for the Award is generated by taking the average of the overall Annual Performance Factors for the three Performance Years, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth, and cannot be greater than 125.00% or
less than 0.00%.        (b) Calculation of Payout Share Units . The number of
Payout Share Units is calculated by applying the Overall Performance Factor as a percentage to the initial outstanding IPUs, rounded down to the nearest whole share unit.     
  (c) Final Award Determination .    
      -10-  

The Committee will certify the level of performance, calculate the
Payout Share Units and determine the Final Award as soon as practicable following the last day of the applicable Performance Period. In the event of your death prior to a Change of Control, such determination will occur as soon as practicable
following the calendar year that includes your date of death (if earlier).     
       In the event of a Change of Control, the amount of Payout Share Units will be
calculated (as of the date of the Change of Control) and determination of the Final Award will be made as soon as practicable after the Change of Control.     
       The Final Award may not exceed the maximum Payout Share Units determined as described
in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.     
       The Committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce the size of a Final Award as
provided in paragraph 7.     
       The Final Award will become vested and payable as of the Final Award Date (defined in
 Appendix B  of the Agreement).   

10. 
    
  Determination of Performance Factors Upon Death or a Change of Control   

Death 
    
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your employment with PNC ceases by reason of your death (or if you die after a termination of employment with PNC due to Disability or Retirement or following an
Anticipatory Termination), but prior to a Final Award Date, then all performance-based vesting requirements will be met as of the Final Award Date, and such portion will payable based on (a) the average of the actual Annual Performance Factor
calculated for the completed Performance Years (if any) and the Performance Year that includes the date of death, and (b) a 100% Annual Performance Factor for any remaining Performance Years following the calendar year of death. This amount is
not pro-rated, but in general, remains subject to the Committee s exercise of negative discretion.   
      -11-  

If a Change of Control occurs after your death and in the same calendar year of your death (but prior to the time the Committee makes a Final Award determination), the Final Award will be calculated as described below under
 Change of Control  as though you remained continuously employed with PNC as of the Change of Control.  

Change of Control 
    
    Calculation of Potential Payout Share Units        
 Upon a Change of Control, with respect to any outstanding portion of the Award as of the Change of Control, the total number of Payout Share Units is
calculated in two parts, the  Pre-COC Tranche  and the  Post-COC Tranche .     
  (a) Determination of Pre-COC Tranche:      
          A  Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor  is calculated
based on the weighted average of:     
 (1)    the higher of (x) 100% and (y) the actual Annual Corporate Performance Factor for any full
Performance Years completed prior to the Change of Control, subject to the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factors and the Annual Risk Review Performance Factors applicable to such Performance Years, and 
     (2)    for the year in which
the Change of Control occurs (provided such year contains at least one full quarter as of the Change of Control), the higher of (x) 100% and (y) the actual Corporate Performance Factor for the full quarters completed prior to and including the
Change of Control, subject to the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor but which is calculated as of the last quarter-end prior to the Change of Control date (or, if the Change of Control occurs on a quarter-end date and if such information
is available with respect to and applicable for such date, on the Change of Control date), and the same Risk Review Performance Factor as the last Annual Risk Review Performance Factor applicable prior to the Change of Control (or if none,
100%). If the Change of Control occurs prior to the end of the first quarter of the Performance Year, no Annual Performance Factor will be calculated    

for that Performance Year for purposes of calculating the Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor. 
     (3)    In generating the
weighted average, the Annual Performance Factors in the numerator will be weighted based on the number of full quarters represented by that Performance Year, with the denominator being 12. 
             
The Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor is applied to the portion of the Award determined by multiplying the number of outstanding IPUs under the Award by the number of full calendar quarters of the Performance Period completed prior to the
Change of Control and dividing by 12.     
       The result is the number of IPUs constituting the Pre-COC Tranche. 
           All remaining
outstanding IPUs constitute the Post COC Tranche, subject to adjustment as described in subparagraph (b) below.     
  (b) Determination of Post-COC Tranche.    The number of IPUs constituting the Post-COC Tranche is adjusted based on the Post-Change of Control
Performance Factor. The Post-Change of Control Performance Factor is calculated using a 100% Corporate Performance Factor, subject to the Annual Tier 1 Risk-Based Performance Factor but which is measured as of the last quarter-end prior to the
Change of Control date (or, if the Change of Control occurs on a quarter-end date and if such information is available with respect to and applicable for such date, on the Change of Control date). 
      (c) Determination of Payout Share Units following a Change of Control . The
calculated maximum Payout Share Units are determined by adding together the number of IPUs in the Pre-COC Tranche and the number of IPUs in the Post-COC Tranche upon application of the applicable Performance Factors. The amount of Payout Share
Units is rounded down to the nearest whole share unit. The Committee does not have discretion to increase or decrease this calculated potential award amount.    

11. 
    
  Definition of Change of Control Coverage Period  
    
     Change of Control Coverage Period   means a period commencing on the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event
(defined below) and ending upon the earlier to occur of (a) the date of a Change of Control Failure (defined below) and (b) the date of a Change of Control. After the termination of any Change of Control Coverage Period, another Change of
Control Coverage Period will commence upon the occurrence of another Change of Control Triggering Event.     
 For purposes of this definition:     
      a   Change of Control Triggering Event   means the occurrence of either
of the following: (i) the Board or PNC s shareholders approve a Business Combination, other than an Excluded Combination (as defined in the definition of Change of Control in  Appendix B ), or (ii) the commencement of a proxy contest
in which any Person seeks to replace or remove a majority of the members of the Board     
      a   Change of Control Failure   means: (x) with respect to a Change
of Control Triggering Event, PNC s shareholders vote against the transaction approved by the Board or the agreement to consummate the transaction is terminated; or (y) with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event described in clause
(ii) of the definition above, the proxy contest fails to replace or remove a majority of the members of the Board.

  R ELATIVE  EPS G ROWTH         

* 
 Consistent with the design of this compensation program and approach taken in prior years, this schedule interpolates results to arrive at final annual corporate performance potential payout percentages for relative EPS
growth corporate performance. The final annual corporate performance payout percentage for the relative EPS growth corporate performance metric for a given year or partial year period will depend both on PNC s relative EPS growth
performance ranking (which generates a payout percentage range between the midpoints of the payout percentages for the rank below and the rank above PNC) and on PNC s performance for that same period relative to the EPS growth performance of
the peers ranked immediately above and below PNC (which determines the adjusted payout percentage within this range). See example below.   
 Where interpolation is impracticable or would not produce a meaningful result, the unadjusted percentage will be used. The payout
percentage will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.     Example:  If PNC achieves a #5 ranking, the schedule indicates that the
payout percentage for this rank would be between 110.00% (which is the mid-point between 105.00% and 115.00% in the table) and 117.50% (which is the mid-point between 115.00% and 120.00% in the table). The final calculated percentage depends on
how PNC s EPS growth for the year or partial year compares to the EPS growth of the peers for the same period ranking immediately above and below PNC, in this example the performance of the peers ranking #4 and #6. If PNC achieves a #10
ranking (the lowest ranking that would generate a payout percentage above zero) for the EPS growth corporate performance metric, the schedule indicates that the payout percentage for this rank would be between 20.00% and 50.00% and the final
calculated percentage would be determined based on the comparison of PNC s performance for that corporate performance metric to that of the peers ranking #9 and #11.

limitations considered enforceable by the court.    v.  Waiver of Jury Trial . Each of you and PNC hereby waives any

measured by reference to the per share value of the consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction or Transactions if applicable, and (iii) with respect to stock-payable PRSUs only, if the effect
of the Corporate Transaction or Transactions on a holder of Common Stock is to convert that shareholder s holdings into consideration that does not consist solely (other than as to a minimal amount) of shares of Common Stock, then the entire

termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party that has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  
    Cause    means (a) your willful and continued failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by PNC that specifically identifies the manner in which it is believed that you have not substantially performed your
duties; (b) your material breach of (1) any code of conduct of PNC that is applicable to you or (2) other written policy of PNC that is applicable to you, in either case required by law or established to maintain compliance with
applicable law; (c) any act of fraud, misappropriation, material dishonesty, or embezzlement by you against PNC or any client or customer of PNC; (d) your conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) for, or entry into a
pre-trial disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony; or (e) entry of any order against you by any governmental body having regulatory authority with respect to the business of PNC that relates to or arises out of your employment
or other service relationship with PNC.    The cessation of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been a termination of your employment for Cause
for purposes of the Agreement only if and when PNC, by PNC s CEO or his or her designee (or, if you are the CEO, the Board, or if you are another  officer  of PNC, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act (and the rules
thereunder), the Board or the Committee), determines that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above or that an event described in clause (d) or (e) above has occurred with respect to you and, if so,
determines that the termination of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been for Cause.       CEO    means the chief
executive officer of PNC.  
      i  

Change of Control    means:  
 (a) Any Person becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either
(x) the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the   Outstanding PNC Common Stock  ) or (y) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of PNC entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(the   Outstanding PNC Voting Securities  ). The following acquisitions will not constitute a Change of Control for purposes of this definition: (1) any acquisition directly from PNC, (2) any acquisition by PNC, (3) any
acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by PNC or any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with PNC (an   Affiliated Company  ), (4) any acquisition pursuant to an
Excluded Combination (as defined below) or (5) an acquisition of beneficial ownership representing between 20% and 40%, inclusive, of the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities or Outstanding PNC Common Stock if the Incumbent Board (as defined

Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the   Incumbent Board  ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board (excluding any Board seat that is vacant or otherwise unoccupied). For purposes
of this definition, any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of PNC, was approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered as though such individual was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual

subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PNC, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by PNC or any of its subsidiaries (each, a   Business Combination  ). A transaction
otherwise meeting the definition of Business Combination will not be treated as a Change of Control if following completion of the transaction all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding
PNC Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (or, for a non-corporate entity, equivalent securities) and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or, for a  non-corporate  entity, equivalent governing body), as the case may be, of the entity
resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns PNC or all or substantially all of PNC s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially
the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities, as the case may be (such a Business Combination, an   Excluded

partner, shareholder, proprietor or in any other individual or representative capacity therein. For purposes of Competitive Activity as defined herein (and as such similar term is defined in any equity-based award agreement held by you), the term
 subsidiary  will not include any company in which PNC holds an interest pursuant to its merchant banking authority.       Detrimental
Conduct    means:    (a) You have engaged in, without the prior written consent of PNC (with consent to be given or withheld at

    Effective Date    has the meaning set forth in Section A of the Agreement.  
    Fair Market Value    as it relates to a share of Common Stock as of any given date means (a) the reported closing price on the New
York Stock Exchange (or such successor reporting system as PNC may select) for a share of Common Stock on such date, or, if no Common Stock trades have been reported on such exchange for that day, such closing price on the preceding day for which
there were reported trades or, if the Committee has so acted, (b) fair market value as determined using such other reasonable method adopted by the Committee in good faith for such purpose that uses actual transactions in PNC common stock as
reported by a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, provided that such method is consistently applied. When determining Fair Market Value under this Award or any currently outstanding award under the Plan you hold, the Fair
Market Value will be rounded to the nearest cent.       Good Reason    means the definition of Good Reason contained in the Change of
Control Employment Agreement between you and PNC or any substitute employment agreement entered into between you and PNC then in effect or, if none, the occurrence of any of the following events without your consent:  
 (a) the assignment to of any duties to you inconsistent in any material respect with your position (including status, offices, titles and
reporting requirements), or any other material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities;    (b) any material
reduction in your rate of base salary or the amount of your annual bonus opportunity (or, if less, the bonus opportunity established for the PNC s similarly situated employees for any year), or a material reduction in the level of any other
employee benefits for which you are eligible receive below those offered to the PNC s similarly situated employees;    (c) PNC s

 (e) the failure by PNC to require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of PNC to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PNC would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.  
      iv  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the events described above shall constitute Good Reason
unless and until (i) you first notify PNC in writing describing in reasonable detail the condition which constitutes Good Reason within 90 days of its initial occurrence, (ii) PNC fails to cure such condition within 30 days after receipt
of such written notice, and (iii) you terminate employment within two years of its initial occurrence.    Your mental or physical
incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (a) through (e) shall not affect your ability to terminate employment for Good Reason, and your death following delivery of a notice of termination for Good Reason
shall not affect your estate s entitlement to severance payments benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.  
    Misconduct    means, as it relates to an Anticipatory Termination or following a Change of Control, (a) your willful and continued
failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the CEO that
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the CEO believes that you have not substantially performed your duties; or (b) your willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious
to PNC or any of its subsidiaries. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on your part, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by you in bad faith and without reasonable belief that your
action or omission was in the best interests of PNC. Any act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or prior approval of the Board, the CEO or your superior or based upon the advice of counsel for PNC, will be conclusively presumed to be
done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of PNC.    Your cessation of employment will be deemed to be a termination of
your employment with PNC for Misconduct only if and when there shall have been delivered to you, as part of the notice of your termination, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire
membership of the Board, at a Board meeting called and held for the purpose of considering such termination, finding on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of conduct described in
clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such resolution shall be adopted only after (i) reasonable notice of such Board meeting is provided to you, together with written notice
that PNC believes that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (ii) you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard
before the Board.  
      v  

Person    means any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act .        PNC    has one of the following meanings, depending on the context

THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.   
  2006 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN   
  PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS AWARD AGREEMENT   
   APPENDIX C    
  PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS   
  SENIOR LEADERS PROGRAM (SECTION 16 EXECUTIVES)   
 The following table sets forth the performance-based vesting conditions of the Award:  

1.  
   
    Generally   
    
   The Award is divided into four Tranches, with the first Tranche relating to the 2016 performance year, the second Tranche relating to the
2017 performance year, and so on.       Performance-based vesting and calculation of
related payout for each outstanding Tranche is adjusted based on an annual risk review performance factor relating to PNC s return on economic capital (ROEC), as defined in paragraph 4 below, relative to the applicable Committee-specified risk
performance hurdle for that year for purposes of comparison, business unit financial performance or at the discretion of the Committee.       
 
   2.  
   
    Risk Review  
  Performance  
  Factor   
    
   The ROEC-related risk metric and business unit financial performance each serve as a trigger to determine whether or not a risk
performance review and potential downward adjustment by the Committee is required. In addition, and independent from the ROEC-related risk metric or business unit financial performance, the Committee has the discretion to conduct a risk performance
review. Any determination to conduct a risk performance review will be made shortly after the close of the applicable year, but no later than the 45 th  day following the close of such year. 
     The  ROEC hurdle  for a given risk performance year is the risk performance
hurdle specified by the Committee (no later than March 30th of that performance year) for purposes of comparison of ROEC to such hurdle. The hurdle is related to PNC s cost of capital, and is set at a level at which the Committee believes
ROEC performance below that level for the year could be an indication of a possibly inappropriate level of risk and therefore warrant a risk performance review by the Committee. 
      
      -1-  

A review is triggered (1) if the Committee requires a review in its discretion, (2) one of the specific business unit or enterprise level
review triggers set forth below is met and that review trigger is applicable to you because either (a) it applies to your business unit or functional area as of the Grant Date and the Committee has not determined in its discretion to apply a
different review trigger to you for the given performance year or (b) the Committee has determined in its discretion to apply such specific business unit or enterprise level review trigger to you for the specific performance year or years; or (3)
PNC s ROEC is less than the ROEC hurdle for that performance year.       The specific
business unit or enterprise level review triggers referenced in clause (2) above are as follows:     
         PNC s Retail Banking segment reports a loss for the performance
year     
         PNC s Corporate   Institutional Banking segment reports a
loss for the performance year     
         PNC s Asset Management Group segment reports a loss for the
performance year     
         PNC s Residential Mortgage Banking segment reports a loss for the
performance year     
         PNC s return on economic capital with specified adjustments
( ROEC ) for the performance year is less than the applicable Committee-specified ROEC hurdle amount for that performance year.     
 If you are not assigned to one of the above-named business units as of the Grant Date, the specific review trigger applicable to you will be the one that
relates to PNC s ROEC relative to the applicable Committee-specified hurdle amount unless and until the Committee determines otherwise in its discretion.     
 For purposes of this Agreement, whether or not a specified business unit has a loss for a given performance year will be determined on the basis of the
reported earnings or loss, as the case may be, of the reportable business segment that includes the results of such business unit, based on PNC s publicly reported financial results for that year. 
      
      -2-  

If a review is triggered, the Committee determines a risk review performance factor with respect to each Tranche (the   Annual Risk
Review Performance Factor  ), as follows:     
         As soon as practicable, the Committee will conduct a review to
determine if a downward-adjustment for risk performance is appropriate and, if so, the size of that adjustment.     
         The Risk Review Performance Factor for a given year and Tranche may
range from 0.00% to 100.00% (where a factor less than 100.00% reflects a downward adjustment of the payout size of the Tranche).     
         Using a sliding scale and other principles as guidelines, together
with Committee discretion, the Committee determines the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor.     
 If no review is conducted with respect to that year, or if the Committee determines not to apply a downward adjustment for risk performance either to a Tranche
or to a specific Grantee, the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for that year will be 100.00%.     
  ROEC  for a given performance year will be calculated as earnings for the applicable performance year, divided by average economic capital for the
same calendar year, calculated to two places to the right of the decimal, rounded to the nearest hundredth, and where  earnings  and  economic capital  have the following meanings: 
      Earnings  will mean PNC s publicly-reported earnings for the applicable
calendar year adjusted, on an after-tax basis, for the impact of the items set forth below:     
      items resulting from a change in tax law; 
          discontinued
operations (as such term is used under GAAP);     
      acquisition costs and merger integration costs; 
          any costs or
expense arising from specified Visa litigation (including Visa-litigation-related    
      -3-  

expenses/charges recorded for obligations to Visa with respect to the costs of specified litigation or the
gains/reversal of expense recognized in connection with such obligations) and any other gains recognized on the redemption or sale of Visa shares as applicable;       

acceleration of the accretion of any remaining issuance discount in
connection with the redemption of any preferred stock, and any other charges or benefits related to the redemption of trust preferred or other preferred securities; and     
     the net impact on PNC of significant gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions. 
      Economic capital  means total economic capital for PNC on a consolidated basis
as that term is used by PNC for its internal measurement purposes, and average economic capital for the applicable calendar year will mean such average economic capital as calculated by PNC for internal purposes. 
      For the 2016 performance year, the Committee-approved ROEC hurdle level is related to
PNC s cost of capital and is set at 7.43%.        
 
   3.  
   
    Prospective  
  Adjustments;  
  Committee  
  Determinations   
    
 The Committee may make prospective adjustments to the Award to the extent such adjustments would not cause the loss of a deduction under Code Section 162(m). All determinations made by the Committee or otherwise by PNC hereunder
shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties.  
 
       4. 

Determination of Performance
Factors Upon Death or a Change of Control        

Death 
    
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your employment with PNC ceases by reason of your death, or if you die after a termination of employment with PNC due to Disability or Retirement or by reason of an
Anticipatory Termination, in any case, prior to a Change of Control or any Scheduled Vesting Date(s), then all performance-based vesting requirements will be met with respect to the outstanding unvested portion of your Award, and such portion will
payable based on 100% performance for the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor (unless the date of death occurs after a   
      -4-  

calendar year but prior to performance-adjustment by the Committee for a given Tranche, in which case such Tranche will vest based on
actual performance as determined by the Committee).       For the avoidance of doubt, in
the event of your death following a Change of Control, the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for any then outstanding Tranche will be determined as provided in the  Change of Control  paragraph below. 

Change of Control 
    
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to your satisfaction of the service-based vesting requirements, any
outstanding Tranches for which no Annual Risk Review Performance Factors have been determined at the time of a Change of Control will be performance-adjusted based on the last Annual Risk Review Performance Factor applicable prior to the Change of
Control (or, if none, then 100.00%) for each Tranche, effective as of the day immediately preceding the date of the Change of Control.     
 For the avoidance of doubt:     
      If the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor was 0.00%, the Award will be forfeited by
you as of the Change of Control.     
      Tranches that remain outstanding will be paid out, without further Dividend Equivalents
or any interest, on the Scheduled Vesting Dates (or earlier, in the event of your death) upon your satisfaction of the service-based vesting requirements.     
      If a Change of Control occurs after your death, and the date of death occurs after a
calendar year but prior to performance-adjustment by the Committee for a given Tranche, such Tranche will vest based on actual performance as determined by the Committee if such Committee determination was made as of the date immediately preceding
the date of the Change of Control. If no Committee determination was made as of the date immediately preceding the Change of Control, then the Annual Risk Review Performance Factor for such Tranche will be determined as set forth in this
 Change of Control  subparagraph.    
      -5-  

5.  
   
    Determination of  
  Payout Share Units   
    
     Payout Share Units   means the performance-adjusted number of PRSUs in a Tranche that are eligible to vest. With respect
to each Tranche, the calculation of Payout Share Units is determined as follows (with all percentages rounded to the nearest .01):     
      The Annual Risk Review Performance Factor is determined for the performance year related
to that Tranche to generate the overall   Annual Performance Factor   for the Tranche (ranging from 0.00% to 100.00%).     
      The number of Payout Share Units for that Tranche is calculated by applying the Annual
Performance Factor as a percentage of the initial outstanding PRSUs in a Tranche, rounded down to the nearest whole unit. Initial outstanding PRSUs in a Tranche that do not become Payout Share Units will be cancelled.

iv.  Reform . If any of Sections 1(a) 1(c) are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because unreasonable either as to length of time or area to which the restriction applies, it is the intent of both parties that the court reduce and reform the restriction so as to apply the
greatest limitations considered enforceable by the court.        v.  Waiver of Jury Trial . Each of you and
PNC hereby waives any right to trial by jury with regard to any suit, action or proceeding under or in connection with any of Sections 1(a) 1(c).

its delegate shall make those adjustments, if any, in the number, class or kind of IPUs then outstanding under the Award that it deems appropriate in its discretion to reflect the Corporate Transaction such that your rights are neither enlarged nor
diminished as a result of such Corporate Transaction, including without limitation (i) measuring the value per share unit of any share-denominated award amount authorized for payment to you by reference to the per share value of the

consideration payable to a holder of Common Stock in connection with such Corporate Transaction or Transactions if applicable, and (iii) with respect to stock-payable IPUs only, if the effect of the Corporate Transaction or Transactions on a
holder of Common Stock is to convert that shareholder s holdings into consideration that does not consist solely (other than as to a minimal amount) of shares of Common Stock, then the entire value of any payment to be made to you will be made
solely in cash at the applicable time specified in this Agreement.     3.  Fractional Interest  . If the outstanding vested IPUs

 (a) You shall be solely responsible for any applicable taxes (including, without limitation, income and excise taxes), penalties and interest
that you incur in connection hereunder. PNC will, at the time any withholding tax obligation arises in connection herewith, retain an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount of taxes then required to be withheld by PNC in connection
therewith from amounts then payable hereunder to you.    (b) If any such withholding is required prior to the time amounts are payable to
you hereunder or if such amounts are not sufficient to satisfy such obligation in full, the withholding will be taken from other compensation then payable to you or as otherwise determined by PNC.

purposes of this Section 6(c), Shares retained to satisfy applicable withholding tax requirements will be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date the tax withholding obligation arises (as such date is determined by PNC).

breach hereof will be brought exclusively in the Federal court for the Western District of Pennsylvania or in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. By execution of this Agreement, you and PNC hereby consent to the exclusive

      -5-  

(f)  Severability . The restrictions and obligations imposed by this Agreement are separate
and severable, and it is the intent of both parties that if any restriction or obligation imposed by any of these provisions is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void for any reason whatsoever, the remaining provisions, restrictions

Definitions  . Except as otherwise provided, the following definitions apply for purposes of the Agreement.       Anticipatory
Termination    means a termination of employment where PNC terminates your employment with PNC (other than for Misconduct or Disability) prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs, and you reasonably demonstrated that such
termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party that has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control.  
    Cause    means (a) your willful and continued failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure
resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by PNC that specifically identifies the manner in which it is believed that you have not substantially performed your
duties; (b) your material breach of (1) any code of conduct of PNC that is applicable to you or (2) other written policy of PNC that is applicable to you, in either case required by law or established to maintain compliance with
applicable law; (c) any act of fraud, misappropriation, material dishonesty, or embezzlement by you against PNC or any client or customer of PNC; (d) your conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) for, or entry into a
pre-trial disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony; or (e) entry of any order against you by any governmental body having regulatory authority with respect to the business of PNC that relates to or arises out of your employment
or other service relationship with PNC.    The cessation of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been a termination of your employment for Cause
for purposes of the Agreement only if and when PNC, by PNC s CEO or his or her designee (or, if you are the CEO, the Board, or if you are another  officer  of PNC, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act (and the rules
thereunder), the Board or the Committee), determines that you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above or that an event described in clause (d) or (e) above has occurred with respect to you and, if so,
determines that the termination of your employment with PNC will be deemed to have been for Cause.       CEO    means the chief
executive officer of PNC.  
      i  

Change of Control    means:    
 (a) Any Person becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either
(x) the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (the   Outstanding PNC Common Stock  ) or (y) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of PNC entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(the   Outstanding PNC Voting Securities  ). The following acquisitions will not constitute a Change of Control for purposes of this definition: (1) any acquisition directly from PNC, (2) any acquisition by PNC, (3) any
acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by PNC or any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with PNC (an   Affiliated Company  ), (4) any acquisition pursuant to an

Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the   Incumbent Board  ) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board (excluding any Board seat that is vacant or otherwise unoccupied). For purposes
of this definition, any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the shareholders of PNC, was approved by a vote of at least  two-thirds  of the
directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered as though such individual was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;

subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of PNC, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by PNC or any of its subsidiaries (each, a   Business Combination  ). A transaction
otherwise meeting the definition of Business Combination will not be treated as a Change of Control if following completion of the transaction all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding
PNC Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock (or, for a non-corporate entity, equivalent securities) and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or, for a  non-corporate  entity, equivalent governing body), as the case may be, of the entity
resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns PNC or all or substantially all of PNC s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially
the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding PNC Common Stock and the Outstanding PNC Voting Securities, as the case may be (such a Business Combination, an   Excluded

enter within the next 12 months (or, if after your Termination Date, within the first 12 months after your Termination Date), in either case whether you are acting as agent, consultant, independent contractor, employee, officer, director, investor,
partner, shareholder, proprietor or in any other individual or representative capacity therein. For purposes of Competitive Activity as defined herein (and as such similar term is defined in any equity-based award agreement held by you), the term

Conduct    means:    (a) You have engaged in, without the prior written consent of PNC (with consent to be given or withheld at
PNC s sole discretion), in any Competitive Activity in the Restricted Territory at any time during the period of your employment with PNC and the 12-month period following your Termination Date;  
 (b) any act of fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement by you against PNC or one of its subsidiaries or any client or customer of PNC or one
of its subsidiaries; or    (c) you are convicted (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere) of, or you enter into a pre-trial
disposition with respect to, the commission of a felony that relates to or arises out of your employment or other service relationship with PNC.  
 You will be deemed to have engaged in Detrimental Conduct for purposes of the Agreement only if and when the Committee or other PNC Designated
Person determines that you have engaged in conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above or that an event described in clause (c) above has occurred with respect to you. Detrimental Conduct will not apply to conduct by or
activities of successors to the Award by will or the laws of descent and distribution in the event of your death.    No determination that
you have engaged in Detrimental Conduct may be made (x) on or after your Termination Date if your termination of employment was an Anticipatory Termination or (y) between the time PNC enters into an agreement providing for a Change of
Control and the time such agreement either terminates or results in a Change of Control.  
      iii  

Disabled   or   Disability    means that you either (i) are unable to
engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (ii) are,
by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, receiving (and have received for at least three months)
income replacement benefits under any PNC-sponsored disability benefit plan. If you have been determined to be eligible for U.S. Social Security disability benefits, you will be presumed to be Disabled as defined herein.

York Stock Exchange (or such successor reporting system as PNC may select) for a share of Common Stock on such date, or, if no Common Stock trades have been reported on such exchange for that day, such closing price on the preceding day for which
there were reported trades or, if the Committee has so acted, (b) fair market value as determined using such other reasonable method adopted by the Committee in good faith for such purpose that uses actual transactions in PNC common stock as
reported by a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, provided that such method is consistently applied. When determining Fair Market Value under this Award or any currently outstanding award under the Plan you hold, the Fair
Market Value will be rounded to the nearest cent.          Final Award Date    means (a) the date on which the Committee makes
its determination as to the size of the payout of a Final Award (defined in  Appendix C ), if any, following the end of the Performance Period, (b) in the event of your death prior to the last calendar year of the Performance Period, the
date on which the Committee makes its determination as to the size of the payout of a Final Award, if any, following the calendar year of your death, or (c) if a Change of Control has occurred prior to the date described in (a) and a Final
Award has been authorized, the date upon which the service requirements are satisfied.       Good Reason    means the definition of Good
Reason contained in the Change of Control Employment Agreement between you and PNC or any substitute employment agreement entered into between you and PNC then in effect or, if none, the occurrence of any of the following events without your
consent:    (a) the assignment to of any duties to you inconsistent in any material respect with your position (including status, offices,
titles and reporting requirements), or any other material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities;    (b) any
material reduction in your rate of base salary or the amount of your annual bonus opportunity (or, if less, the bonus opportunity established for the PNC s similarly situated employees for any year), or a material reduction in the level of any
other employee benefits for which you are eligible receive below those offered to the PNC s similarly situated employees;  
      iv  

(c) PNC s requiring you to be based at any office or location outside of a fifty (50)-mile
radius from the office where you were employed on the Grant Date;    (d) any action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the
PNC of any agreement entered into between you and PNC; or    (e) the failure by PNC to require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of PNC to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PNC would be required to perform it
if no such succession had taken place.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the events described above shall constitute Good Reason
unless and until (i) you first notify PNC in writing describing in reasonable detail the condition which constitutes Good Reason within 90 days of its initial occurrence, (ii) PNC fails to cure such condition within 30 days after receipt
of such written notice, and (iii) you terminate employment within two years of its initial occurrence.    Your mental or physical
incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (a) through (e) shall not affect your ability to terminate employment for Good Reason, and your death following delivery of a notice of termination for Good Reason
shall not affect your estate s entitlement to severance payments benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.  
    Misconduct    means, as it relates to an Anticipatory Termination or following a Change of Control, (a) your willful and continued
failure to substantially perform your duties with PNC (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the CEO that
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the CEO believes that you have not substantially performed your duties; or (b) your willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious
to PNC or any of its subsidiaries. For purposes of clauses (a) and (b), no act or failure to act, on your part, shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by you in bad faith and without reasonable belief that your
action or omission was in the best interests of PNC. Any act, or failure to act, based upon the instructions or prior approval of the Board, the CEO or your superior or based upon the advice of counsel for PNC, will be conclusively presumed to be
done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of PNC.    Your cessation of employment will be deemed to be a termination of
your employment with PNC for Misconduct only if and when there shall have been delivered to you, as part  
      v  

of the notice of your termination, a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board, at a Board meeting called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination, finding on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of conduct described in clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either
case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such resolution shall be adopted only after (i) reasonable notice of such Board meeting is provided to you, together with written notice that PNC believes that you are guilty of conduct
described in clause (a) or clause (b) above and, in either case, specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (ii) you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board.

THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.   
  2006 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN   
  CASH-PAYABLE INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE UNITS   
  AWARD AGREEMENT   
   APPENDIX C    
  PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS       
 The following table sets forth the performance-based vesting conditions of the Award:  

1.  
    
  Generally  
    
   Performance-based vesting and payout of your Award is determined based on the level of satisfaction of a corporate performance metric
during each Performance Year, described in more detail in the paragraphs below.       The
performance metric is applied to the Award on an annual basis for each calendar year (i.e., calendar year 2016, calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018) during the Performance Period (each, a   Performance Year  ). A Performance
Year may refer to a partial calendar year in certain limited circumstances (e.g., in connection with death or a Change of Control) as described in this  Appendix C .     
          The performance metric is related to the levels of financial return
from investing activities achieved by PNC s Asset   Liability Unit (  A L Unit  ) relative to a Committee-determined benchmark performance index.     
 The performance metric generates an annual performance factor for a given Performance Year, which is aggregated and applied to the Award, as set forth in
subsequent paragraphs, to calculate the maximum number of IPUs eligible to vest under the Award.     
         Payout Share Units   refers to the performance-adjusted number of IPUs
that are eligible to vest.     
       The amount of Payout Share Units authorized by the Committee to be paid out to you in
accordance with this Agreement is the   Final Award .     
      -1-  

2.  

A L Unit-Related Corporate Performance Factor  

The Award is subject to a corporate performance factor that relates to annual levels of financial return from investing activities
achieved by the A L Unit relative to the applicable   Benchmark Performance Index   where such index, with respect to a given Performance Year (whether the Performance Year consists of a full calendar year or a shorter
partial-year period, as required), is the benchmark performance index that PNC uses internally to evaluate the measured A L Unit performance, as in effect as of March 30 of that Performance Year (or as of the last business day that occurs
prior to March 30 if March 30 does not fall on a business day).        (a)
Measured A L Unit Performance.  The A L Unit performance as measured for a given Performance Year with respect to the performance metric will be expressed as the number of basis points by which the level of financial return from investing
activities achieved by the A L Unit for the applicable Performance Year exceeds or falls short of the Benchmark Performance Index applicable to that same period, with zero basis points indicating performance at the benchmark index level. 
      (b) Calculating the Annual Performance Factor.  
           The Committee
establishes the applicable A L Unit-Related Corporate Performance Schedule for the Award, which is set forth in Exhibit 1 to this  Appendix C .     
       Once the measured A L Unit performance for a given Performance Year has been
calculated and expressed in basis points, the schedule on  Exhibit 1  is used to generate an Annual Performance Factor for the Performance Year.     
       The applicable payout percentage in the schedule on  Exhibit 1  is determined
using interpolation for performance between the points indicated on that schedule, and rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. This is the   Annual Performance Factor .  
           The Annual
Performance Factor will range from 0.00% - 200.00%.   

3.  

Negative Discretion  

The Committee may exercise negative discretion with respect to the Award, including reducing the Annual Performance Factor, and may determine, in light of PNC or individual performance or other factors as the Committee may deem
appropriate, that notwithstanding the levels of   
      -2-  

corporate performance achieved by PNC, the Committee will not award you the full maximum Payout Share Units eligible for
authorization.            
The Committee may use its negative discretion to reduce the size of the Final Award or to cancel the full applicable potential award amount.     
       When deciding whether and to the extent to which to exercise its negative discretion,
the Committee is expected to take into account factors such as absolute A L Unit financial performance, absolute trading results, cumulative performance relative to the benchmark, adherence to risk parameters, and your contributions to the
success of other PNC businesses.     
       The Committee will have no discretion to reduce the maximum Payout Share Units
following a Change of Control or during a Change of Control Coverage Period.     
       In the event (a) your termination of employment with PNC is an Anticipatory
Termination, (b) a Change of Control is pending, and (c) the Committee-determined Final Award Date occurs prior to the Change of Control, the Committee will have no discretion to reduce your calculated maximum Payout Share Units under these
circumstances.   

4.  

Committee Certification of Annual Performance; Prospective Adjustments; Committee Discretion  

The process of certification of the level of PNC s performance by the Committee with respect to the Performance Period will generally
occur in late January or early February after the applicable year end date.       The
Committee may make prospective adjustments to the Award to the extent such adjustments would not cause the loss of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. All determinations made by the Committee or otherwise by PNC hereunder
shall be made in its sole discretion and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all parties.    
      -3-  

5.  
   
  Calculation of Payout Share Units and Determination of Final Award  
    
    (a) Determination of the Overall Performance Factor.  After certification of performance results by the Committee, the
  Overall Performance Factor   for the Award is generated by taking the average of the Annual Performance Factor for the three Performance Years (subject to the provisions of paragraph 6 below in the event of your death or a Change of
Control), reflected as a percentage and rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.        (b)
Calculation of Payout Share Units.  The number of Payout Share Units is calculated by applying the Overall Performance Factor as a percentage to the initial outstanding IPUs, rounded down to the nearest whole share unit. 
      (c) Final Award Determination.  
           The Committee will
certify the level of performance, calculate the Payout Share Units and determine the Final Award as soon as practicable following the last day of the applicable Performance Period. In the event of your death prior to a Change of Control, such
determination will occur as soon as practicable following the calendar year that includes your date of death (if earlier).     
       In the event of a Change of Control, the amount of Payout Share Units will be
calculated (as of the date of the Change of Control) and determination of the Final Award will be made as soon as practicable after the Change of Control.     
       The Final Award may not exceed the maximum Payout Share Units determined as described
in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.     
       The Committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce the size of a Final Award as
provided in paragraph 3.     
       The Final Award will become vested and payable as of the Final Award Date (defined in
 Appendix B  of the Agreement).   

6.  
   
  Determination of Performance Factors Upon Death or a Change of Control    
      -4-  

Death 
    
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if your employment with PNC ceases by reason of your death (or if you die
after a termination of employment with PNC due to Disability or Retirement or following an Anticipatory Termination), but prior to a Final Award Date, then all performance-based vesting requirements will be met as of the Final Award Date, and such
portion will payable based on (a) the average of the actual Annual Performance Factor calculated for the completed Performance Years (if any) and the Performance Year that includes the date of death, and (b) a 100% Annual Performance Factor for any
remaining Performance Years following the calendar year of death. This amount is not pro-rated, but in general, remains subject to the Committee s exercise of negative discretion. 
     If a Change of Control occurs after your death and in the same calendar year of your
death (but prior to the time the Committee makes a Final Award determination), the Final Award will be calculated as described below under  Change of Control  as though you remained continuously employed with PNC as of the Change of
Control.   

Change of Control 
    
    Calculation of Potential Payout Share Units       
 Upon a Change of Control, with respect to any outstanding portion of the Award as of the Change of Control, the total number of Payout Share Units is
calculated in two parts, the  Pre-COC Tranche  and the  Post-COC Tranche .     
  (a) Determination of Pre-COC Tranche:      
          A  Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor  is calculated
based on the weighted average of:     
 (1)    the higher of (x) 100% and (y) the actual Annual Performance Factor for any full
Performance Years completed prior to the Change of Control, and     
 (2)    for the year in which the Change of Control occurs (provided such year contains at least
one full quarter as of the Change of Control), the higher of (x) 100% and (y) the actual Annual Performance Factor for the full quarters completed prior to and including the Change of Control date. If the Change of Control
occurs    
      -5-  

prior to the end of the first quarter of the Performance Year, no Annual Performance Factor will be calculated for
that Performance Year for purposes of calculating the Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor.     
 (3)    In generating the weighted average, the Annual Performance Factors in the numerator will be
weighted based on the number of full quarters represented by that Performance Year, with the denominator being 12.     
          The Pre-Change of Control Performance Factor is applied to the
portion of the Award determined by multiplying the number of outstanding IPUs under the Award by the number of full calendar quarters of the Performance Period completed prior to the Change of Control and dividing by 12. 
           The result is the
number of IPUs constituting the Pre-COC Tranche.     
       All remaining outstanding IPUs constitute the Post-COC Tranche, subject to subparagraph
(b) below.        (b) Determination of Post-COC Tranche . The number of IPUs
constituting the Post-COC Tranche is adjusted based on the Post-Change of Control Performance Factor, which is 100%.     
  (c) Determination of Payout Share Units following a Change of Control . The calculated maximum Payout Share Units are determined by adding together the
number of IPUs in the Pre-COC Tranche and the number of IPUs in the Post-COC Tranche upon application of the applicable Annual Performance Factors. The amount of Payout Share Units is rounded down to the nearest whole share unit. The Committee does
not have discretion to increase or decrease this calculated potential award amount.   

7.  

Definition of Change of Control Coverage Period  

Change of Control Coverage Period   means a period commencing on the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (defined below) and ending upon the earlier to occur of (a) the date of a Change of Control
Failure (defined below) and (b) the date of a Change of   
      -6-  

Control. After the termination of any Change of Control Coverage Period, another Change of Control Coverage Period will commence upon the
occurrence of another Change of Control Triggering Event.       For purposes of this
definition:             a
  Change of Control Triggering Event   means the occurrence of either of the following: (i) the Board or PNC s shareholders approve a Business Combination, other than an Excluded Combination (as defined in the definition of
Change of Control in  Appendix B ), or (ii) the commencement of a proxy contest in which any Person seeks to replace or remove a majority of the members of the Board     
       a   Change of Control Failure   means: (x) with respect to a Change of
Control Triggering Event, PNC s shareholders vote against the transaction approved by the Board or the agreement to consummate the transaction is terminated; or (y) with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event described in clause (ii)
of the definition above, the proxy contest fails to replace or remove a majority of the members of the Board.
