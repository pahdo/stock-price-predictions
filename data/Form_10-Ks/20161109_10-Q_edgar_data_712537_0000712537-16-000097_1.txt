  Note 1 Basis of Presentation 
  The accounting and reporting policies of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries ( First Commonwealth  or the  Company ) conform with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual realized amounts could differ from those estimates. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of First Commonwealth s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders  equity as of and for the periods presented. 
  The results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year of   2016  . These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with First Commonwealth s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing bank deposits. Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods. 
   
  Note 2 Supplemental Comprehensive Income Disclosures 
  The following table identifies the related tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  Reclassification adjustments related to securities available for sale are included in the "Net securities gains" line and reclassification adjustments related to losses on derivatives are included in the "Other operating expenses" line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 4 Earnings per Share 
  The following table summarizes the composition of the weighted-average common shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 

The following table shows the number of shares and the price per share related to common stock equivalents that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the   nine months ended     September 30   because to do so would have been antidilutive. 

Note 5 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  Commitments and Letters of Credit 
  Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by First Commonwealth to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The contract or notional amount of these instruments reflects the maximum amount of future payments that First Commonwealth could be required to pay under the guarantees if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. In addition, many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
  The following table identifies the notional amount of those instruments at: 

The notional amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   include amounts issued in   2016   of   $23 thousand   in financial standby letters of credit,   $2.9 million   in performance standby letters of credit and   $0.2 million   commercial letters of credit.  A liability of   $0.2 million   has been recorded as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   which represents the estimated fair value of letters of credit issued. The fair value of letters of credit is estimated based on the unrecognized portion of fees received at the time the commitment was issued.

    ITEM 1.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Unused commitments and letters of credit provide exposure to future credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower or guaranteed parties. Management s evaluation of the credit risk related to these commitments resulted in the recording of a liability of   $4.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $4.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . This liability is reflected in "Other liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The credit risk evaluation incorporated probability of default, loss given default and estimated utilization for the next twelve months for each loan category and the letters of credit. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  First Commonwealth and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. As of September 30, 2016, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation pending or threatened against First Commonwealth or its subsidiaries will be material to First Commonwealth s consolidated financial position. On at least a quarterly basis, First Commonwealth assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with such legal proceedings. For those matters where it is probable that First Commonwealth will incur losses and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated, First Commonwealth records an expense and corresponding liability in its consolidated financial statements. To the extent the pending or threatened litigation could result in exposure in excess of that liability, the amount of such excess is not currently estimable. Although not considered probable, the range of reasonably possible losses for such matters in the aggregate, beyond the existing recorded liability (if any), is between   $0   and   $7 million  .  Although First Commonwealth does not believe that the outcome of pending litigation will be material to First Commonwealth s consolidated financial position, it cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes will be material to the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for a particular reporting period in the future. 
  First Commonwealth Financial Corporation and First Commonwealth Bank were named defendants in an action commenced August 27, 2015 by eight named plaintiffs that is pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County, Pennsylvania.  The plaintiffs allege that the Bank repossessed motor vehicles, sold the vehicles and sought to collect deficiency balances in a manner that did not comply with the notice requirements of the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), charged inappropriate costs and fees, including storage costs for dates that a repossessed vehicle was not in storage, and wrongly filed forms with the Department of Motor Vehicles asserting that the Bank had complied with applicable laws relating to the repossession of the vehicles. The plaintiffs seek to pursue the action as a class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and other similarly situated plaintiffs who had their automobiles repossessed and seek to recover damages under the UCC and the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act.  First Commonwealth and the Bank contest the plaintiffs  allegations and intend to oppose class certification.  The Bank has also asserted counterclaims for breach of contract, set-off and recoupment against the plaintiffs, individually, and as representatives of the putative class.  The Bank and counsel for the plaintiffs reached an agreement-in-principle to settle the litigation during the second quarter of 2016.  The parties are negotiating the terms of a definitive settlement agreement which would be subject to court approval and other customary conditions.  The estimated cost of the settlement to the Bank was recorded as a liability in the second quarter of 2016.  As set forth in the preceding paragraph, all current litigation matters, including this action, are believed to be within the range of reasonably possible losses set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Note 6 Investment Securities 
  Securities Available for Sale 
  Below is an analysis of the amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities available for sale at: 

Mortgage backed securities include mortgage backed obligations of U.S. Government agencies and obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. These obligations have contractual maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately 30 years with lower anticipated lives to maturity due to prepayments. All mortgage backed securities contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment speeds; therefore, First Commonwealth uses computer simulation models to test the average life and yield volatility of all mortgage backed securities under various interest rate scenarios to monitor the potential impact on earnings and interest rate risk positions. 
    
  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Other fixed income securities within the portfolio also contain prepayment risk.

Note 7 Impairment of Investment Securities 
  Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity 
  As required by FASB ASC Topic 320,  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities,  credit-related other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities is recognized in earnings, while non-credit related other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities not expected to be sold is recognized in OCI. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized.  
  First Commonwealth utilizes the specific identification method to determine the net gain or loss on debt securities and the average cost method to determine the net gain or loss on equity securities. 
  We review our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment. This review includes analyzing the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and whether we are more likely than not to sell, or be required to sell, the security. We evaluate whether we are more likely than not to sell debt securities based upon our investment strategy for the particular type of security, our cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy, tax position and interest rate risk position. In addition, the risk of future other-than-temporary impairment may be influenced by additional bank failures, weakness in the U.S. economy, changes in real estate values and additional interest deferrals in our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations. Our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 325,  Investments   Other,  and are therefore evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment using management s best estimate of future cash flows. If these estimated cash flows indicate that it is probable that an adverse change in cash flows has occurred, then other-than-temporary impairment would be recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320. There is a risk that First Commonwealth will record other-than-temporary impairment charges in the future. See Note 10,  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities,  for additional information. 
  The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values at   September 30, 2016   for both available for sale and held to maturity securities by investment category and time frame for which securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

At   September 30, 2016  , fixed income securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises comprised   6%   of total unrealized losses due to changes in market interest rates. Pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations accounted for   93%   of the unrealized losses primarily due to the illiquid market for this investment type.  At   September 30, 2016  , there are   22   debt securities in an unrealized loss position.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values at   December 31, 2015   by investment category and time frame for which securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our corporate securities had an amortized cost and an estimated fair value of   $5.9 million   and   $6.5 million  , respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , our corporate securities had an amortized cost and estimated fair value of   $1.9 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively.  Corporate securities are comprised of debt for large regional banks.  There were no corporate securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  When unrealized losses exist on these investments, management reviews each of the issuer s asset quality, earnings trends and capital position, to determine whether issues in an unrealized loss position were other-than-temporarily impaired. All interest payments on the corporate securities are being made as contractually required. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the book value of our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations totaled   $43.0 million   with an estimated fair value of   $35.6 million  , which includes securities comprised of   268   banks and other financial institutions. All of our pooled securities are mezzanine tranches,   three   of which have no senior class remaining in the issue. The credit ratings on all of our issues are below investment grade.  At the time of initial issue, the subordinated tranches ranged in size from approximately   7%   to   35%   of the total principal amount of the respective securities and no more than   5%   of any pooled security consisted of a security issued by any one institution. As of   September 30, 2016  , after taking into account management s best estimates of future interest deferrals and defaults,   three   of our securities had no excess subordination in the tranches we own and   six   of our securities had excess subordination which ranged from   2%   to   82%   of the current performing collateral.

  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The following table provides information related to our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Lack of liquidity in the market for trust preferred collateralized debt obligations, below investment grade credit ratings and market uncertainties related to the financial industry are factors contributing to the impairment on these securities. 
  In October 2016, the Company received notice that the Senior note holders of Pre TSL VII elected to liquidate all assets of the trust. The sale of the assets and early redemption of the security is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Estimated proceeds are expected to be in line with our book value. 
  All of the Company's pooled trust preferred securities are included in the non-exclusive list issued by the regulatory agencies and therefore are not considered covered funds under the Volcker Rule. 
  On a quarterly basis we evaluate our debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charges recognized on our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations. When evaluating these investments, we determine a credit-related portion and a non-credit related portion of other-than-temporary impairment. The credit-related portion is recognized in earnings and represents the difference between book value and the present value of future cash flows. The non-credit related portion is recognized in OCI and represents the difference between the fair value of the security and the amount of credit-related impairment. A discounted cash flow analysis provides the best estimate of credit-related other-than-temporary impairment for these securities. 
  Additional information related to the discounted cash flow analysis follows: 
  Our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations are measured for other-than-temporary impairment within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 325 by determining whether it is probable that an adverse change in estimated cash flows has occurred. Determining whether there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected involves comparing the present value of remaining cash flows previously projected against the present value of the cash flows estimated at   September 30, 2016  . We consider the discounted cash flow analysis to be our primary evidence when determining whether credit related other-than-temporary impairment exists. 
    
  Results of a discounted cash flow test are significantly affected by other variables, such as the estimate of future cash flows, credit worthiness of the underlying banks and determination of probability of default of the underlying collateral. The following provides additional information for each of these variables: 
             
    Estimate of Future Cash Flows   Cash flows are constructed in an INTEX cash flow model which includes each deal s structural features. Projected cash flows include prepayment assumptions, which are dependent on the issuer's asset size and coupon rate.  For collateral issued by financial institutions over   $15 billion   in asset size with a coupon over   7%  , a   100%   prepayment rate is assumed. Financial institutions over   $15 billion   with a coupon of   7%   or under are assigned a prepayment rate of   40%   for two years and   2%   thereafter. Financial institutions with assets between   $2 billion   and   $15 billion   with coupons over   7%   are assigned a   5%   prepayment rate. For financial institutions below   $2 billion  , if the coupon

is over   10%  , a prepayment rate of   5%   is assumed and for all other issuers, there is   no   prepayment assumption incorporated into the cash flows.  The modeled cash flows are then used to estimate if all the scheduled principal and interest payments of our investments will be returned.  
             
    Credit Analysis   A quarterly credit evaluation is performed for each of the   268   banks comprising the collateral across the various pooled trust preferred securities. Our credit evaluation considers all evidence available to us and includes the nature of the issuer s business, its years of operating history, corporate structure, loan composition, loan concentrations, deposit mix, asset growth rates, geographic footprint and local economic environment. Our analysis focuses on profitability, return on assets, shareholders  equity, net interest margin, credit quality ratios, operating efficiency, capital adequacy and liquidity. 
                
    Probability of Default   A probability of default is determined for each bank and is used to calculate the expected impact of future deferrals and defaults on our expected cash flows. Each bank in the collateral pool is assigned a probability of default for each year until maturity. Currently, any bank that is in default is assigned a   100%   probability of default and a   0%   projected recovery rate. All other banks in the pool are assigned a probability of default based on their unique credit characteristics and market indicators with a   10%   projected recovery rate. For the majority of banks currently in deferral we assume the bank continues to defer and will eventually default and, therefore, a   100%   probability of default is assigned. However, for some deferring collateral there is the possibility that they will become current on interest or principal payments at some point in the future and in those cases a probability that the deferral will ultimately cure is assigned. The probability of default is updated quarterly. As of   September 30, 2016  , default probabilities for performing collateral ranged from   0.33%   to   75%  . 
     Our credit evaluation provides a basis for determining deferral and default probabilities for each underlying piece of collateral. Using the results of the credit evaluation, the next step of the process is to look at pricing of senior debt or credit default swaps for the issuer (or where such information is unavailable, for companies having similar credit profiles as the issuer). The pricing of these market indicators provides the information necessary to determine appropriate default probabilities for each bank. 
  In addition to the above factors, our evaluation of impairment also includes a stress test analysis which provides an estimate of excess subordination for each tranche. We stress the cash flows of each pool by increasing current default assumptions to the level of defaults that results in an adverse change in estimated cash flows. This stressed breakpoint is then used to calculate excess subordination levels for each pooled trust preferred security. The results of the stress test allow management to identify those pools that are at a greater risk for a future break in cash flows so that we can monitor banks in those pools more closely for potential deterioration of credit quality. 
  Our cash flow analysis as of   September 30, 2016  , indicates that   no   credit-related other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on our pooled trust preferred securities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Based upon the analysis performed by management, it is probable that   three   of our pooled trust preferred securities will experience principal and interest shortfalls and therefore appropriate other-than-temporary charges were recorded in prior periods. These securities are identified in the table on page 17 with   0.00%    Excess Subordination as a Percentage of Current Performing Collateral.  For the remaining securities listed in that table, our analysis as of   September 30, 2016   indicates it is probable that we will collect all contractual principal and interest payments.  For four of those securities, PreTSL IX, PreTSL XIII, PreTSL XIV and MMCap I, other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded in prior periods; however, due to improvement in the expected cash flows of these securities, it is now probable that all contractual payments will be received. 
  During 2008, 2009 and 2010, other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized on all of our pooled trust preferred securities, except for PreTSL IV. Our cash flow analysis as of   September 30, 2016  , for all of these impaired securities indicates that it is now probable we will collect principal and interest in excess of what was estimated at the time other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded. This change can be attributed to improvement in the underlying collateral for these securities and has resulted in the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments exceeding the securities' current book value. The excess for each bond of the present value of future cash flows over our current book value ranges from   19%   to   123%   and will be recognized as an adjustment to yield over the remaining life of these securities.  The excess subordination recognized as an adjustment to yield is reflected in the following table as increases in cash flows expected to be collected.

The following table provides a cumulative roll forward of credit losses recognized in earnings for debt securities held and not intended to be sold: 

(a) 
    The beginning balance represents credit related losses included in other-than-temporary impairment charges recognized on debt securities in prior periods. 
              (b) 
    Represents the increase in cash flows recognized in interest income during the period. 
     In the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  ,   no   other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded on equity securities. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing the severity and duration of decline in estimated fair value, research reports, analysts  recommendations, credit rating changes, news stories, annual reports, regulatory filings, impact of interest rate changes and other relevant information. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   equity securities in an unrealized loss position. 
  Other Investments 
  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), First Commonwealth is required to purchase and hold stock in the FHLB to satisfy membership and borrowing requirements. The level of stock required to be held is dependent on the amount of First Commonwealth's mortgage-related assets and outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. This stock is restricted in that it can only be sold to the FHLB or to another member institution, and all sales of FHLB stock must be at par. As a result of these restrictions, FHLB stock is unlike other investment securities insofar as there is no trading market for FHLB stock and the transfer price is determined by FHLB membership rules and not by market participants. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our FHLB stock totaled   $54.1 million   and   $63.0 million  , respectively, and is included in  Other investments  on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
  FHLB stock is held as a long-term investment and its value is determined based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. First Commonwealth evaluates impairment quarterly and has concluded that the par value of its investment in FHLB stock will be recovered.  Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded on these securities during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Credit Quality Information 
  As part of the on-going monitoring of credit quality within the loan portfolio, the following credit worthiness categories are used in grading our loans: 
                   Pass 
       
    Acceptable levels of risk exist in the relationship. Includes all loans not classified as OAEM, substandard or doubtful. 

Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM) 
       
    Potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. The potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or weaken the Company s credit position at some future date. The credit risk may be relatively minor, yet constitute an undesirable risk in light of the circumstances surrounding the specific credit. No loss of principal or interest is expected. 

Substandard 
       
    Well-defined weakness or a weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt. A loan may be classified as substandard as a result of deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and repayment capacity. Loans for which repayment plans have not been met or collateral equity margins do not protect the Company may also be classified as substandard. 

Doubtful 
       
    Loans with the characteristics of substandard loans with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of presently existing facts and conditions, is highly improbable. 

The use of creditworthiness categories to grade loans permits management s use of migration analysis to estimate a portion of credit risk. The Company s internal creditworthiness grading system provides a measurement of credit risk based primarily on an evaluation of the borrower s cash flow and collateral. Movement between these rating categories provides a predictive measure of credit losses and therefore assists in determining the appropriate level for the loan loss reserves. Category ratings are reviewed each quarter, at which time management analyzes the results, as well as other external statistics and factors related to loan performance. Loans that migrate towards higher risk rating levels generally have an increased risk of default, whereas loans that migrate toward lower risk ratings generally will result in a lower risk factor being applied to those related loan balances. 
  The following tables represent our credit risk profile by creditworthiness:

Portfolio Risks 
  The credit quality of our loan portfolio can potentially represent significant risk to our earnings, capital, regulatory agency relationships, investment community reputation and shareholder returns. First Commonwealth devotes a substantial amount of resources managing this risk primarily through our credit administration department that develops and administers policies and procedures for underwriting, maintaining, monitoring and collecting activities. Credit administration is independent of lending departments and oversight is provided by the credit committee of the First Commonwealth Board of Directors. 
  Criticized loans have been evaluated when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, which we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent to the portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . However, changes in economic conditions, interest rates, borrower financial condition, delinquency trends or previously established fair values of collateral factors could significantly change those judgmental estimates. 
  Age Analysis of Past Due Loans by Segment 
  The following tables delineate the aging analysis of the recorded investments in past due loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Also included in these tables are loans that are   90   days or more past due and still accruing because they are well-secured and in the process of collection.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Nonaccrual Loans 
  The previous tables summarize nonaccrual loans by loan segment. The Company generally places loans on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, when part of the principal balance has been charged off and no restructuring has occurred, or the loans reach a certain number of days past due. Generally, loans   90   days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status, except for consumer loans, which are placed in nonaccrual status at   150   days past due.  
  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, the accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income and all future payments received are applied as a reduction to the loan principal. Generally, the loan is returned to accrual status when (a) all delinquent interest and principal becomes current under the terms of the loan agreement or (b) the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer in doubt. 
  Impaired Loans 
  Management considers loans to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is determined that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. Determination of impairment is treated the same across all loan categories. When management identifies a loan as impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the sole source for repayment of the loan is the operation or liquidation of collateral. When the loan is collateral dependent, the appraised value less estimated cost to sell is utilized. If management determines the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance.  Troubled debt restructured loans on accrual status are also considered to be impaired loans. 
  When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, contractual interest is credited to interest income when received under the cash basis method. 
  Significant nonaccrual loans as of   September 30, 2016  , include the following: 
             
    An   $11.8 million   relationship of commercial industrial loans to a steel and aluminum servicing company.  These loans were originated in 2011 and were placed in nonaccrual status during the first quarter of 2016.  The collateral valuation completed in the third quarter of 2016 incorporated certain estimates obtained in the first quarter of 2016.  
                
    A   $4.3 million   relationship of commercial industrial loans to an oil and gas well services company.  These loans were originated in 2014 and were placed in nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2015.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , charge-offs of   $2.0 million   related to this relationship were recorded. Values used in the September 30, 2016 collateral valuation were updated in the third quarter of 2016.  
                
    A   $4.0 million   relationship of commercial industrial loans to a manufacturer of mine safety products.  These loans were originated from 2014 to 2015 and were placed in nonaccrual status during the second quarter of 2016.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , charge-offs of   $6.5 million   related to this relationship were recorded.  A collateral valuation completed in September 2016 incorporated certain estimates obtained in the second quarter of 2016.

Note 10 Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
  FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosures for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). All non-financial assets are included either as a separate line item on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition or in the  Other assets  category of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Currently, First Commonwealth does not have any non-financial liabilities to disclose. 
  FASB ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments , permits entities to irrevocably elect to measure select financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses are required to be included in earnings each reporting period for the items that fair value measurement is elected. First Commonwealth has elected not to measure any existing financial instruments at fair value under FASB ASC Topic 825; however, in the future we may elect to adopt this guidance for select financial instruments. 
    
  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, First Commonwealth groups financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels based on the principal markets in which the assets and liabilities are transacted and the observability of the data points used to determine fair value. These levels are: 
             
    Level 1   Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ). Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.  
                
    Level 2   Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained for identical or comparable assets or liabilities from alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Level 2 includes Obligations of U.S. Government securities issued by Agencies and Sponsored Enterprises, Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions, corporate securities, FHLB stock, loans held for sale, interest rate derivatives (including interest rate caps, interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements), certain other real estate owned and certain impaired loans. 
     Level 2 investment securities are valued by a recognized third party pricing service using observable inputs. The model used by the pricing service varies by asset class and incorporates available market, trade and bid information as well as cash flow information when applicable. Because many fixed-income investment securities do not trade on a daily basis, the model uses available information such as benchmark yield curves, benchmarking of like investment securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. The model will also use processes such as an option adjusted spread to assess the impact of interest rates and to develop prepayment estimates. Market inputs normally used in the pricing model include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. 
  Management validates the market values provided by the third party service by having another recognized pricing service price 100% of the securities on an annual basis and a random sample of securities each quarter, monthly monitoring of variances from prior period pricing and, on a monthly basis, evaluating pricing changes compared to expectations based on changes in the financial markets. 
  Other investments recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are comprised of FHLB stock whose estimated fair value is based on its par value. Additional information on FHLB stock is provided in Note 7,  Impairment of Investment Securities.   
  Loans held for sale include residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary mortgage market. The estimated fair value for these loans was determined on the basis of rates obtained in the respective secondary market. 
  Interest rate derivatives are reported at an estimated fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs and are included in other assets and other liabilities, and consist of interest rate swaps where there is no significant deterioration in the counterparties' (loan customers') credit risk since origination of the interest rate swap as well as interest rate caps and risk participation agreements. First Commonwealth values its interest rate swap and cap positions using a yield curve by taking market prices/rates for an appropriate set of instruments. The set of instruments currently used to determine the U.S. Dollar yield curve includes cash LIBOR rates from overnight to one year, Eurodollar futures contracts and swap rates from one year to thirty years. These yield curves determine the valuations of interest rate swaps. Interest rate derivatives are further described in Note 11,  Derivatives.  
  For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, First Commonwealth evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties as well as our own credit risk. Accordingly, we have considered factors such as the likelihood of default,  
  
   29 

    ITEM 1.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

expected loss given default, net exposures and remaining contractual life, among other things, in determining if any fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. We review our counterparty exposure quarterly, and when necessary, appropriate adjustments are made to reflect the exposure. 
  We also utilize this approach to estimate our own credit risk on derivative liability positions. In   2016  , we have not realized any losses due to a counterparty's inability to pay any uncollateralized positions. 
  The estimated fair value for other real estate owned included in Level 2 is determined by either an independent market-based appraisal less estimated costs to sell or an executed sales agreement. 
             
    Level 3   Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other valuation methodologies, including option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer or broker traded transactions. If the inputs used to provide the valuation are unobservable and/or there is very little, if any, market activity for the security or similar securities, the securities would be considered Level 3 securities. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities. The assets included in Level 3 are pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations, non-marketable equity investments, certain interest rate derivatives, certain other real estate owned and certain impaired loans. 
     Our pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations are collateralized by the trust preferred securities of individual banks, thrifts and bank holding companies in the United States. There has been little or no active trading in these securities since 2009; therefore, it is more appropriate to determine estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Detail on our process for determining the appropriate cash flows for this analysis is provided in Note 7,  Impairment of Investment Securities.  The discount rate applied to the cash flows is determined by evaluating the current market yields for comparable corporate and structured credit products along with an evaluation of the risks associated with the cash flows of the comparable security. Due to the fact that there is no active market for the pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations, one key reference point is the market yield for the single issue trust preferred securities issued by banks and thrifts for which there is more activity than for the pooled securities. Adjustments are then made to reflect the credit and structural differences between these two security types. 
  Management validates the fair value of the pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral, discussing the discount rate, cash flow assumptions and general market trends with a specialized third party and confirming changes in the underlying collateral to the trustee reports. Management s monitoring of the underlying collateral includes deferrals of interest payments, payment defaults, cures of previously deferred interest payments, any regulatory filings or actions and general news related to the underlying collateral. Management also evaluates fair value changes compared to expectations based on changes in the interest rates used in determining the discount rate and general financial markets. 
  The estimated fair value of the non-marketable equity investments included in Level 3 is based on par value. 
  The estimated fair value of limited partnership investments included in Level 3 is based on par value. 
  For interest rate derivatives included in Level 3, the fair value incorporates credit risk by considering such factors as likelihood of default and expected loss given default based on the credit quality of the underlying counterparties (loan customers).

In accordance with ASU 2011  -4  , the following table provides information related to quantitative inputs and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurements. 

(a) 
    Incorporates spread over risk free rate related primarily to credit quality and illiquidity of securities. 
              (b) 
    The remainder of impaired loans valued using Level 3 inputs are not included in this disclosure as the values of those loans are based on bankruptcy agreement documentation. 
              (c) 
    Unobservable inputs are defined as follows: MCF - million cubic feet; BBL/d - barrels per day. 
     The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of pooled trust preferred securities are the probability of default, discount rates and prepayment rates. Significant increases in the probability of default or discount rate used would result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of these securities, while decreases in these variables would result in higher fair value measurements. In general, a change in the assumption of probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the discount rate. In most cases, increases in the prepayment rate assumptions would result in a higher estimated fair value for these securities while decreases would provide for a lower value. The direction of this change is somewhat dependent on the structure of the investment and the amount of the investment tranches senior to our position. 
  The discount rate is the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of impaired loans. Significant increases in this rate would result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the loans, while a decrease in this rate would result in a higher fair value measurement. Other unobservable inputs in the fair value measurement of impaired loans relate to gas, oil and natural gas prices.  Increases in these prices would result in an increase in the estimated fair value of the loans, while a decrease in these prices would result in a lower fair value measurement.

The tables below present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at: 

The following gain (losses) were realized on the assets measured on a nonrecurring basis: 

Impaired loans over   $100 thousand   are individually reviewed to determine the amount of each loan considered to be at risk of non-collection. The fair value for impaired loans that are collateral based is determined by reviewing real property appraisals, equipment valuations, accounts receivable listings and other financial information. A discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine fair value for impaired loans when an observable market price or a current appraisal is not available. For real estate secured loans, First Commonwealth s loan policy requires updated appraisals be obtained at least every twelve months on all impaired loans with balances of   $250 thousand   and over.  For real estate secured loans with balances under   $250 thousand  , we rely on broker price opinions. For non-real estate secured assets, the Company normally relies on third party valuations specific to the collateral type. 
  The fair value for other real estate owned, determined by either an independent market-based appraisal less estimated costs to sell or an executed sales agreement, is classified as Level 2. The fair value for other real estate owned determined using an internal valuation is classified as Level 3.  Other real estate owned has a current carrying value of   $7.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and consists primarily of commercial real estate properties in Pennsylvania. We review whether events and circumstances subsequent to a transfer to other real estate owned have occurred that indicate the balance of those assets may not be recoverable. If events and circumstances indicate further impairment we will record a charge to the extent that the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair values, less estimated cost to sell, as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances. 
  Certain other assets and liabilities, including goodwill and core deposit intangibles, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. Additional information related to goodwill is provided in Note 12,  Goodwill.  There were no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  FASB ASC 825-10,  Transition Related to FSP FAS   107  -1    and APB   28  -1  ,  Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are as discussed above. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below.

Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing bank deposits  :   The carrying amounts for cash and due from banks and interest-bearing bank deposits approximate the estimated fair values of such assets. 
  Securities  :   Fair values for securities available for sale and held to maturity are based on quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Pooled trust preferred collateralized debt obligations values are derived from other valuation methodologies, including option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and not based on market exchange, dealer or broker traded transactions. These valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to each instrument. The carrying value of other investments, which includes FHLB stock, is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
  Loans  :   The fair values of all loans are estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality adjusted for past due and nonperforming loans, which is not an exit price under FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  
  Loans Held for Sale  :   The estimated fair value of loans held for sale is based on market bids obtained from potential buyers. 
  Off-balance sheet instruments  :   Many of First Commonwealth s off-balance sheet instruments, primarily loan commitments and standby letters of credit, are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. FASB ASC Topic 460,  Guarantees  clarified that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The carrying amount and fair value for standby letters of credit was   $0.2 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . See Note 5,  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,  for additional information. 
  Deposit liabilities  :    The estimated fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date because of the customers  ability to withdraw funds immediately. The carrying value of variable rate time deposit accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the report date. Also, fair values of fixed rate time deposits for both periods are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rates currently being offered and a schedule of aggregated expected maturities. 
  Short-term borrowings  :   The fair values of borrowings from the FHLB were estimated based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowings. The carrying amounts of other short-term borrowings such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase were used to approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the borrowings. 
  Long-term debt and subordinated debt  :   The fair value of long-term debt and subordinated debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using First Commonwealth s estimate of the current market rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements or an announced redemption price.

Note 11 Derivatives 
  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  First Commonwealth is a party to interest rate derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives relate to interest rate swaps that First Commonwealth enters into with customers to allow customers to convert variable rate loans to a fixed rate. First Commonwealth pays interest to the customer at a floating rate on the notional amount and receives interest from the customer at a fixed rate for the same notional amount. At the same time the interest rate swap is entered into with the customer, an offsetting interest rate swap is entered into with another financial institution. First Commonwealth pays the other financial institution interest at the same fixed rate on the same notional amount as the swap entered into with the customer, and receives interest from the financial institution for the same floating rate on the same notional amount.

  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

The changes in the fair value of the swaps offset each other, except for the credit risk of the counterparties, which is determined by taking into consideration the risk rating, probability of default and loss given default for all counterparties.  
  We have   27   risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are a participant. The risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution.  We have   eight   risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are the lead bank.  The risk participation agreement provides credit protection to us should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with us. 
  First Commonwealth is also party to interest rate caps that are not designated as hedging instruments.  These derivatives relate to contracts that First Commonwealth enters into with loan customers that provide a maximum interest rate on their variable rate loan. At the same time the interest rate cap is entered into with the customer, First Commonwealth enters into an offsetting interest rate cap with another financial institution.  The notional amount and maximum interest rate on both interest cap contracts are identical.  
  The fee received, less the estimate of the loss for the credit exposure, was recognized in earnings at the time of the transaction. 
  Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  The Company has entered into four interest rate swap contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swaps have a total notional amount of   $200.0 million  ,   $85.0 million   with an original maturity of three years and   $115.0 million   with and original maturity of four years. The Company's risk management objective for these hedges is to reduce its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to interest payments on commercial loans benchmarked to the 1-month LIBOR rate.  Therefore, the interest rate swaps convert the interest payments on the first   $200.0 million   of 1-month LIBOR based commercial loans into fixed rate payments. 
  The periodic net settlement of interest rate swaps is recorded as an adjustment to "Interest and fees on loans" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there was a   $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million   impact on interest income as a result of these interest rate swaps, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are reported in OCI. When the cash flows associated with the hedged item are realized, the gain or loss included in OCI is recognized in "Interest and fees on loans," the same line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as the income on the hedged items. The cash flow hedges were highly effective at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , and changes in the fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness were not material.  
  The following table depicts the credit value adjustment recorded related to the notional amount of derivatives outstanding as well as the notional amount of risk participation agreements participated to other banks:

The fair value of our derivatives is included in a table in Note 18,  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities,  in the line items 
   Other assets  and  Other liabilities.  

Note 12 Goodwill 
  FASB ASC Topic 350-20,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  requires an annual valuation of the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill and a comparison of the fair value to the book value of equity to determine whether the goodwill has been impaired. Goodwill is also required to be tested on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. When triggering events or circumstances indicate that goodwill testing is required, an assessment of qualitative factors can be completed before performing the two step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011-8 provides that if an assessment of qualitative factors determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the two step goodwill impairment test is not required. 
  We consider First Commonwealth to be one reporting unit. The carrying amount of goodwill as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $164.4 million   and   $164.5 million  , respectively.   No   impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets were incurred in   2016   or   2015  .  
  We test goodwill for impairment as of November 30th each year and again at any quarter-end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , goodwill was not considered impaired; however, changing economic conditions that may adversely affect our performance, the fair value of our assets and liabilities, or our stock price could result in impairment, which could adversely affect earnings in future periods. Management will continue to monitor events that could impact this conclusion in the future. 
   
  Note 13 New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," with an original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2015-14 on our financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)," which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  This ASU addresses: 1. requiring equity investments to be measured at fair value, recognizing the changes in fair value through net income; 2. simplifying the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3. eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public entities; 4. eliminating the requirement for public entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost; 5. requiring

public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments; 6. requiring an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; 7. requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and 8. clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 for public entities and for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for entities that are not public entities.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on First Commonwealth s financial condition or results of operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Lessor accounting under the new guidance remains largely unchanged as it is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. Leveraged leases have been eliminated, although lessors can continue to account for existing leveraged leases using the current accounting guidance. Other limited changes were made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the new revenue recognition standard. All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The intention is to require enough information to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  All entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Entities have the option to use certain relief; full retrospective application is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of  ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements.  
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)," which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  This ASU is effective for public entities beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on First Commonwealth s financial condition or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This update requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election for forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on First Commonwealth s financial condition or results of operations. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which amends the guidance for recognizing credit losses from an  incurred loss  methodology that delays recognition of credit losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred to an expected credit loss methodology. The guidance requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. The standard is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on First Commonwealth s financial condition or results of operations 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: 1. debt prepayment or extinguishment costs; 2. settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates; 3. contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 4. proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5. proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; 6. distributions received from equity method investees; 7. beneficial interests in securitizations transactions; and 8. separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  This ASU provides additional guidance for these eight issues, reducing current and potential diversity in practice.  This standard is

  Note 14 Subsequent Event 
    
  On October 3, 2016, the Company announced the signing of a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger providing for the merger of DCB Financial Corporation with and into the Company in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately   $14.50   per share, or   $106 million   in the aggregate. The acquisition of DCB Financial Corporation includes approximately   $556 million   in total assets,   $467 million   in deposits,   $397 million   in total loans and   9   full-service banking offices in the Columbus market area.  This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.

In addition, certain statements may be contained in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by us or with our approval that are not statements of historical fact and constitute  forward-looking statements  as well. These statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   should,   could,   would,   plan,   believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate  or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties, and could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on First Commonwealth and its customers; (2) volatility and disruption in national and international financial markets; (3) the effects of and changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; (4) inflation, interest rate, commodity  price, securities market and monetary fluctuations; (5) the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance) with which First Commonwealth or its customers must comply; (6) the soundness of other financial institutions; (7)  political instability; (8) impairment of First Commonwealth s goodwill or other intangible assets; (9) acts of God or of war or terrorism; (10) the timely development and acceptance of new products and services and perceived overall value of these products and services by users; (11) changes in consumer spending, borrowings and savings habits; (12) changes in the financial performance and/or condition of First Commonwealth s borrowers; (13) technological changes; (14) acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses; (15) First Commonwealth s ability to attract and retain qualified employees; (16) changes in the competitive environment in First Commonwealth s markets and among banking organizations and other financial service providers; (17) the ability to increase market share and control expenses; (18) the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standard setters; (19) the reliability of First Commonwealth s vendors, internal control systems or information systems; (20) the costs and effects of legal and regulatory developments, the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory or other governmental inquiries, the results of regulatory examinations or reviews and the ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; and (21) other risks and uncertainties described in this report and in the other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements in this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
  Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
  In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), First Commonwealth management uses, and this quarterly report contains or references, certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and our business and performance trends as it facilitates comparison with the performance of others in the financial services industry. Although we believe that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors  understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. 
  We believe the presentation of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Interest income per the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis on pages 45 and 52 for the   nine   and   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Selected Financial Data 
  The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which follows, and with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.    

Results of Operations 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
   
  Net Income 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , First Commonwealth had net income of   $41.7 million  , or   $0.47   diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of   $40.1 million  , or   $0.45   diluted earnings per share, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in net income was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense, offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses.  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company s return on average equity was   7.53%   and its return on average assets was   0.83%  , compared to   7.48%   and   0.84%  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .   
   
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was   $150.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $142.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets of   $310.2 million  . Net interest income comprises a majority of our operating revenue (net interest income before provision expense plus noninterest income), at   76%   and   75%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was   3.28%   and   3.29%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The   one   basis point   decline   in the net interest margin is attributable to an increase in the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities.

The taxable equivalent yield on interest-earning assets was   3.59%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an increase of   four   basis points compared to the   3.55%   yield for the same period in   2015  . Excluding the impact of a special FHLB dividend in the first quarter of 2015, the yield on interest-earning assets would have increased   six   basis points. This increase is largely due to the investment portfolio yield, which, after excluding the impact of the $1.0 million special FHLB dividend, improved by   19   basis points when compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase can be attributed to the runoff or sale of lower yielding U.S. Agency securities, which were replaced with higher yielding investment securities. Investment portfolio purchases during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   have been primarily in mortgage-related assets with approximate durations of 48-60 months and municipal securities with durations of approximately five years.  The mortgage-related investments have monthly principal payments that will provide for reinvestment opportunities if interest rates rise.  
  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to   0.40%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   0.34%   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in the cost of short-term borrowings. Offsetting that increase was a   7   basis point decline in the cost of time deposits, as higher cost time deposits ran off and were replaced with growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and short-term borrowings.  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , changes in interest rates   negatively   impacted net interest income by   $2.3 million   when compared with the same period in   2015  . The higher yield on interest-earning assets   positively   impacted net interest income by   $1.1 million  , while the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities had a negative impact of   $3.4 million  . We have been able to partially mitigate the impact of low interest rates and the effect on net interest income through improving the mix of deposits and borrowed funds, growing the loan portfolio and increasing our investment yields by re-investing cash flow from runoff and from sales of lower-yielding investments.   
  While increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities compressed the net interest margin, increases in average interest-earning assets more than offset the effect on net interest income. Average earning assets for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $310.2 million  , or   5%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Average loans for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $296.4 million  , or   7%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .   
  Changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities   positively   impacted net interest income by   $9.9 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  . Higher levels of interest-earning assets resulted in an increase of   $9.1 million   in interest income, while changes in the volume of interest-bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by   $0.7 million  , primarily as the result of decreases in long-term debt and time deposits, including brokered deposits. 
  Net interest income also benefited from a   $117.3 million   increase in average net free funds at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   September 30, 2015  . Average net free funds are the excess of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, other noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders  equity over noninterest-earning assets. The largest component of the increase in net free funds was an increase of   $91.5 million  , or   8.8%  , in noninterest-bearing demand deposit average balances. Additionally, higher cost time deposits continue to mature and reprice into lower cost deposits or other funding alternatives. Average time deposits for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased by   $127.4 million   compared to the comparable period in   2015  .

  Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses is determined based on management s estimates of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses needed for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, after giving consideration to charge-offs and recoveries for the period. The provision for credit losses is an amount added to the allowance, against which credit losses are charged. 
    
  The table below provides a breakout of the provision for credit losses by loan category for the   nine months ended     September 30  : 

The provision for credit losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   in comparison to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   by   $11.5 million  . The level of provision expense in the first nine months of   2016   is primarily due to commercial, financial, agricultural and other loans as the result of specific reserves established for two loan relationships, as well as increases in historical loss factors and increases in qualitative factors related to certain recovery rates and economic indicators. The provision for loans to individuals is related to charge-offs in the indirect automobile portfolio as well as changes in economic related qualitative factors. The negative provision for commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans are a result of declines in historical loss factors. 
  The majority of the   2015   provision expense is attributable to loans to commercial, financial and agricultural loans resulting from an increase in historical loss factors, as well as specific reserves established for three loans, partially offset by the release of $1.1 million in specific reserves for loans transferred to held for sale in the first quarter of 2015.  Provision expense for

    ITEM 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 
  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

commercial real estate loans was impacted by charge-offs and increases in qualitative factors including those associated with vacancy and rents. The provision for loans to individuals is primarily due to charge-offs in the indirect automobile portfolio. Real estate construction and residential real estate reflect a negative provision expense  in   2015    due to a decline in historical loss factors for these categories.   
  The allowance for credit losses was   $54.7 million  , or   1.13%  , of total loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $50.8 million  , or   1.08%  , at   December 31, 2015   and   $48.5 million  , or   1.06%  , at   September 30, 2015  .  The change compared to   December 31, 2015  , can be attributed to an increase of   $4.0 million  , or   8%  , in nonperforming loans, resulting in a   $1.1 million   increase in the level of specific reserves held on impaired loans. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to   1.13%   at   September 30, 2016   from   1.09%   at   December 31, 2015   and   0.89%   as of   September 30, 2015  . The allowance to nonperforming loan ratio was   99.83%  ,   99.94%   and   118.84%   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Below is an analysis of the consolidated allowance for credit losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the year-ended   December 31, 2015  :

Noninterest Income 
  The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the   nine months ended     September 30  :    

Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains, gain on sale of loans and other assets and the derivatives mark to market,   increased     $0.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   2015  .  Swap fee income increased compared to   2015  , by   $1.3 million   due to an increase in the number of interest rate swaps entered into for our commercial loan customers during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the same period in the prior year.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased   $0.3 million   and card-related interchange income increased   $0.3 million  , due to increases in customer fee-related activity. Offsetting these increases were insurance and retail brokerage commissions and trust income, which decreased   $0.5 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, due to lower annuity and mutual fund sales. 
  Total noninterest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $0.2 million   in comparison to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The most significant change includes a   $0.7 million   decrease related to the mark to market adjustment on interest rate swaps entered into for our commercial loan customers. This negative adjustment does not reflect an actual loss on the swaps, but rather relates to a change in fair value due to increases in corporate bond spreads and decreases in swap rates.  Offsetting the derivative mark to market adjustment was a   $1.0 million   increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans due to the continuing expansion of our mortgage business.

Noninterest Expense 
  The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30  :    

Noninterest expense, excluding loss on sale or write-down of assets, litigation and operational losses and merger and acquisition related expenses,   decreased     $5.0 million  , or   4%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Contributing to the   2016   decrease is a   $4.1 million   decline in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to the retail transformation initiative, which resulted in some staffing reductions as well as a higher than normal level of open positions in the second and third quarters of 2016. The   $0.9 million   decrease in Pennsylvania shares tax expense  is the result of a $0.7 million settlement paid in the third quarter of 2015.  Despite the addition of four branch locations as a result of the acquisition of First Community Bank in the fourth quarter of   2015  , net occupancy expense was   $0.7 million   lower in the first nine months of   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . Contributing to this decline is $0.3 million in lower snow removal costs and efficiencies related to the closure of four branch locations during   2015  .  Offsetting these decreases is an increase of   $0.9 million   in data processing expense primarily due to the issuance of chip debit cards to our customers during the first nine months of   2016  .  
    
  Loss on sale or write-down of assets decreased   $1.4 million   for the first nine months of   2016   due to $1.1 million in write-downs taken on three OREO properties, as well as a $0.4 million write-down due to the anticipated sale of a bank building during   2015  .  There was no similar activity in   2016  .  Litigation and operational losses decreased   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  In the first   nine   months of   2015  , operational losses were largely due to fraud losses recognized in conjunction with several merchant debit card breaches. Losses of this type were lower in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
   
  Income Tax 
  The provision for income taxes   increased     $0.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . The   higher   provision for income taxes was the result of a   $2.5 million     increase   in the level of income before taxes.  
  We applied the  annual effective tax rate approach  to determine the provision for income taxes, which applies an annual forecast of tax expense as a percentage of expected full year income, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  We generate an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 35% due to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest, income from bank-owned life insurance and tax benefits associated with low income housing tax credits, which are relatively consistent regardless of the level of pretax income. The level of tax benefits that reduced our tax rate below the 35% statutory rate produced an annual effective tax rate of   29.6%   and   29.3%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016  , our deferred tax assets totaled   $27.2 million  . Based on our evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , we determined that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. As a result, a valuation allowance against these assets was not needed. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved forecasts, evaluation of historical earning levels and consideration of potential tax strategies. If future events differ from our current forecasts, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    

Net Income 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , First Commonwealth had net income of   $17.2 million  , or   $0.19   diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of   $12.4 million  , or   $0.14   diluted earnings per share, in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in net income was primarily the result of an in increase in net interest income, as well as decreases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company s return on average equity was   9.14%   and its return on average assets was   1.02%  , compared to   6.86%   and   0.78%  , respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .   

Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was   $50.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $47.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to growth in average interest earning assets of   $324.3 million  .  Net interest income comprises a majority of our operating revenue (net interest income before provision expense plus noninterest income) at   74%   and   75%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  The net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was   3.29%   and   3.25%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The   four   basis point   increase   in the net interest margin is primarily due to an increase in the yield on earning assets.  
    
  The taxable equivalent yield on interest-earning assets was   3.60%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   eight   basis points compared to the   3.52%   yield for the same period in   2015  . This increase is largely due to the investment portfolio yield, which improved by   8   basis points when compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase can be attributed to the runoff or sale of lower yielding U.S. Agency securities, which were replaced with higher yielding investment securities. Investment portfolio purchases during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   have been primarily in mortgage-related assets with approximate durations of 48-60 months and municipal securities with durations of approximately five years.  The mortgage-related investments have monthly principal payments that will provide for reinvestment opportunities if interest rates rise.  
  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to   0.41%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   0.34%   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase of   16   basis points in the cost of short-term borrowings and   8   basis points in the cost of savings deposits. 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , changes in interest rates   negatively   impacted net interest income by   $0.2 million   when compared with the same period in   2015  . The higher yield on interest-earning assets   positively   impacted net interest income by   $1.0 million  , while the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities had a negative impact of   $1.2 million  . We have been able to partially mitigate the impact of low interest rates and the effect on net interest income through improving the mix of deposits and borrowed funds, growing the loan portfolio and increasing our investment yields by reinvesting cash flow from runoff and from sales of lower-yielding investments.   
  While changes in interest rates and yields negatively impacted the net interest margin, increases in average interest-earning assets more than offset the effect on net interest income. Average earning assets for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $324.3 million  , or   5.6%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .  Average loans for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $288.3 million  , or   6.3%  , compared to the same period in   2015  .   
  Changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities   positively   impacted net interest income by   $3.2 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  . Higher levels of interest-

earning assets resulted in an increase of   $3.1 million   in interest income, while changes in the volume of interest-bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by   $0.1 million  , primarily as the result of decreases in long-term debt and time deposits, including brokered deposits. 
  Net interest income also benefited from a   $120.4 million     increase   in average net free funds at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   September 30, 2015  . Average net free funds are the excess of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, other noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders  equity over noninterest-earning assets. The largest component of the increase in net free funds was an increase of   $88.7 million  , or   8.3%  , in noninterest-bearing demand deposit average balances. Additionally, higher cost time deposits continue to mature and reprice into lower cost deposits or other funding alternatives. Average time deposits for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decline  d by   $73.0 million   compared to the comparable period in   2015  .

The provision for credit losses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   in comparison to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   by   $1.2 million  . The level of the   third   quarter   2016   provision expense is primarily due to commercial, financial, agricultural and other loans as the result of an increase in historical loss factors and specific reserves established for one loan relationship.  The negative provision expense for commercial real estate loans and residential real estate is a result of decreases in historical loss factors. The provision for loans to individuals is related to charge-offs in the indirect automobile portfolio.  
  The majority of the provision in   2015   is related to the commercial, financial, and agricultural category because of a $2.5 million increase in specific reserves for two impaired loans. Increases in commercial real estate and loans to individual categories are the result of charge-offs during the quarter, while the negative provision for residential real estate can be attributed to declines in qualitative factors, including those associated with inflation and wages.

Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains, gain on sale of loans and other assets and the derivatives mark to market,   increased     $0.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   2015  .  Swap fee income increased   $0.6 million   due to an increase in the number of swaps entered into for our commercial loan customers during the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year.  Offsetting these increases were insurance and retail brokerage commissions and trust income, which each   decreased     $0.1 million   due to lower annuity and mutual fund sales. 
  Total noninterest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $1.5 million   in comparison to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The most significant change includes a   $1.3 million   increase related to the mark to market adjustment on interest rate swaps entered into for our commercial loan customers. This adjustment does not reflect an actual gain on the swaps, but rather relates to a change in fair value due to decreases in corporate bond spreads and increases in swap rates. 

Noninterest Expense 
  The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the   three months ended     September 30  :    

Noninterest expense   decreased     $1.6 million  , or   4%  , for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . This decrease can be attributed to a   $1.8 million   decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense due to staff reductions and a higher than normal level of open positions in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as a   $0.8 million   decrease in Pennsylvania shares tax expense due to a $0.7 million settlement of a tax dispute in the third quarter of 2015.  Despite the addition of four branch locations as a result of the acquisition of First Community Bank in the fourth quarter of   2015  , net occupancy expense was   $0.1 million   lower in the third quarter of   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Offsetting these decreases is an   increase   of   $0.3 million   in data processing expense, primarily due to the issuance of chip debit cards to our customers during the   third   quarter of   2016   and a   $0.5 million   increase in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other operating expenses. 

Income Tax 
  The provision for income taxes   increased     $2.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . The   higher   provision for income taxes was the result of a   $7.2 million     increase   in the level of income before taxes.  
  We applied the  annual effective tax rate approach  to determine the provision for income taxes, which applies an annual forecast of tax expense as a percentage of expected full year income, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

We generate an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 35% due to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest, income from bank-owned life insurance and tax benefits associated with low income housing tax credits, which are relatively consistent regardless of the level of pretax income. The level of tax benefits that reduced our tax rate below the 35% statutory rate produced an annual effective tax rate of   29.8%   and   28.3%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Liquidity 
  Liquidity refers to our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers as well as our operating cash needs with cost-effective funding. We generate funds to meet these needs primarily through the core deposit base of First Commonwealth Bank and the maturity or repayment of loans and other interest-earning assets, including investments. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , liquidity used by the net decrease in short-term borrowings totaled   $180.5 million  , while the sales, maturity and redemption of investment securities provided   $214.0 million  . This liquidity provided funds needed to originate loans, purchase investment securities and fund depositor withdrawals.  We also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity, including overnight federal funds and repurchase agreements, advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh, borrowings through the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland ( FRB ) and access to certificates of deposit through brokers. 
  We participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services ( CDARS ) program as part of an Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ) strategy to increase and diversify funding sources. As of   September 30, 2016  , our maximum borrowing capacity under this program was   $1.0 billion   and as of that date there was   $0.6 million   outstanding. Also included in this amount is a reciprocal program which allows our depositors to receive expanded FDIC coverage by placing multiple certificates of deposit at other CDARS member banks. As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding certificates of deposits from this program have an average weighted rate of   0.77%   and an average original term of   364 days  . 
  An additional source of liquidity is the FRB Borrower-in-Custody of Collateral program, which enables us to pledge certain loans that are not being used as collateral at the FHLB as collateral for borrowings at the FRB. At   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing capacity under this program totaled   $688.7 million   and there were   no   amounts outstanding. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our maximum borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Pittsburgh was   $1.6 billion   and as of that date amounts used against this capacity included   $1.2 billion   in outstanding borrowings and   $10.2 million   in outstanding letters of credit. 
  We also have available unused federal funds lines with four correspondent banks.  These lines have an aggregate commitment of   $195.0 million   with a total of   $3.0 million   outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  First Commonwealth Financial Corporation has an unsecured   $15.0 million   line of credit with another financial institution.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   no   amounts outstanding on this line.  
  First Commonwealth s long-term liquidity source is its core deposit base. Core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long-term relationship with a deposit customer. The level of deposits during any period is influenced by factors outside of management s control, such as the level of short-term and long-term market interest rates and yields offered on competing investments, such as money market mutual funds. The following table shows a breakdown of the components of First Commonwealth s deposits:    

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , total deposits   increased     $263.1 million   due to a   $163.3 million     increase   in interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and a   $124.9 million   increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.  These increases were offset by a   $25.1 million     decrease   in time deposits.  The   decrease   in time deposits is the result of a decline in wholesale certificates of deposit of   $3.0 million   coupled with a decline in core certificates of deposit of   $22.1 million  .

Market Risk 
  The following gap analysis compares the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time. The ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive liabilities repricing within a one-year period was   0.75   and   0.71   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. A ratio of less than one indicates a higher level of repricing liabilities over repricing assets over the next twelve months. The level of First Commonwealth's ratio is largely driven by the modeling of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits, which are included in the analysis as repricing within one year.  
    
  Gap analysis has limitations due to the static nature of the model that holds volumes and consumer behaviors constant in all economic and interest rate scenarios. A lower level of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities repricing in one year could indicate reduced net interest income in a rising interest rate scenario, and conversely, increased net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario. However, the gap analysis incorporates only the level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and not the sensitivity each has to changes in interest rates. The impact of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates is provided in the table below the gap analysis.  
    
  The following is the gap analysis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our annual net interest income to gradual changes in interest rates over a 12 month time frame as compared with net interest income if rates remained unchanged and there are no changes in balance sheet categories. 

The following table represents the potential sensitivity of our annual net interest income to immediate changes in interest rates versus if rates remained unchanged and there are no changes in balance sheet categories. 

The analysis and model used to quantify the sensitivity of our net interest income becomes less reliable in a decreasing 200 basis point scenario given the current low interest rate environment. Results of the 100 and 200 basis point interest rate decline scenario are affected by the fact that many of our interest-bearing liabilities are at rates below 1%, and therefore cannot decline 100 or 200 basis points, yet our interest-sensitive assets are able to decline by these amounts. In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities averaged   0.40%   and   0.34%  , respectively, and the yield on our average interest-earning assets, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, averaged   3.59%   and   3.55%  , respectively. 
  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company entered into cash flow interest rate swaps, in which we extended the duration of $100.0 million of the $1.3 billion LIBOR based loans in our loan portfolio at that time into fixed interest rates for a period of three or four years. These swaps add approximately two basis points of protection to the net interest margin as a hedge against a  
  
   58 

    ITEM 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 
  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

prolonged low-rate environment. A similar cash flow interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $100.0 million, was entered into in 2014. Please refer to Note 11, "Derivatives," for additional information on interest rate swaps. 
  Asset/liability models require that certain assumptions be made, such as prepayment rates on earning assets and the impact of pricing on non-maturity deposits, which may differ from actual experience. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. While management believes such assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that modeled results will approximate actual results.  
   
  Credit Risk 
  First Commonwealth maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the date of each statement of financial condition. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses. 
  First Commonwealth s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements. These elements include an assessment of individual impaired loans with a balance greater than $0.1 million, loss experience trends and other relevant factors.  
  First Commonwealth also maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based upon credit risk and probability of funding. The reserve totaled   $4.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and is classified in "Other liabilities" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
  First Commonwealth defines exposure to the Oil and Gas Industry as any borrower who is involved in exploration and production, and any company in the industry supply chain that generates 40% or more of their sales revenue from exploration and production companies. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a total of   $126.4 million   in commitments to the Oil and Gas Industry, with   $66.1 million   in outstanding loan balances against those commitments.  Of this total, commitments of   $29.4 million   with outstanding balances of   $6.5 million   are for exploration and production, while   $96.9 million   in commitments, with outstanding balances of   $59.6 million  , are related to ancillary businesses. 
  One customer accounts for   34.0%   of the loans related to exploration and production, and is a pass-rated credit.  This credit facility is primarily used to support letters of credit and has little or no usage.  One commercial relationship totaling   $2.7 million   is categorized as a non-pass accruing credit.  One commercial relationship in this category, totaling   $2.4 million  , has been on non-performing status since before the oil price decline in the third quarter of 2014.   
  The ancillary businesses sector consists of well services, transportation, and providing equipment and materials to support the oil and gas industry.  Two customers, which account for   32.4%   of the ancillary business exposure, are bulk transporters of refined product and are not expected to be negatively impacted from lower oil prices.  There are two pass-rated credits, with total commitments of   $23.6 million  , in the ancillary business sector that will see some impact from reduced drilling activity due to lower oil and gas prices. Three commercial relationships with   $7.7 million   in outstanding loans for ancillary businesses are on non-performing status. 
  Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings. Nonaccrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued. Troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower, who could not obtain comparable terms from alternative financing sources. In the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   57   loans totaling   $12.2 million   were identified as troubled debt restructurings.   
  The balance of troubled debt restructured loans   increased     $0.5 million   from   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the addition of $7.6 million related to two commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by a   $2.7 million   paydown and a   $1.3 million   charge-off on a $3.8 million loan relationship previously categorized as a troubled debt restructure.  Additionally during the third quarter, three loans totaling $1.8 million for borrowers who are no longer experiencing financial difficulties have been subsequently restructured with no concessions granted, therefore, they have been removed from TDR status. Please refer to Note 8,  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses,  for additional information on troubled debt restructurings. 
    
  We discontinue interest accruals on a loan when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to fully collect principal or interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan. A loan is also placed on nonaccrual status when, based on regulatory definitions, the loan is maintained on a  cash basis  due to the weakened financial condition of the  
  
   59 

    ITEM 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 
  FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

borrower. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status, except for consumer loans which are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due.  
  Nonperforming loans are closely monitored on an ongoing basis as part of our loan review and work-out process. The probable risk of loss on these loans is evaluated by comparing the loan balance to the fair value of any underlying collateral or the present value of projected future cash flows. Losses or a specifically assigned allowance for loan losses are recognized where appropriate. 
  Nonperforming loans, including loans held for sale,   increased     $4.0 million   to   $54.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $50.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase is primarily due to the addition of a   $11.8 million   commercial loan relationship with a steel and aluminum servicing company and a   $10.5 million   commercial loan relationship with a coal industry customer.   Offsetting the loans moved to nonperforming are   $12.3 million   in charge-offs recognized in relation to the largest nonaccrual relationships. 
  The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was   99.83%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   99.94%   at   December 31, 2015   and   118.84%   at   September 30, 2015  . The amount of specific reserves included in the allowance for nonperforming loans was determined by using fair values obtained from current appraisals and updated discounted cash flow analyses. The allowance for credit losses includes specific reserves of   $8.2 million   and general reserves of   $46.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Specific reserves   increased     $1.1 million   from   December 31, 2015  , and   $3.9 million   from   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in specific reserves in the first   nine   months of 2016 is primarily due to specific reserves related to one new impaired loan.  Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Criticized loans totaled   $137.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and represented   2.8%   of the loan portfolio.   The level of criticized loans   increased   as of   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  , by   $3.3 million  , or   2.5%  .   Classified loans totaled   $97.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $86.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $10.8 million  , or   12.5%  .  Delinquency on accruing loans for the same period   decreased     $1.6 million  , or   12.7%  , the majority of which are commercial, financial, agricultural and other loans and residential real estate loans. 
  The allowance for credit losses was   $54.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   or   1.13%   of total loans outstanding, compared to   1.08%   reported at   December 31, 2015   and   1.06%   at   September 30, 2015  .  General reserves, or the portion of the allowance related to loans that were not specifically evaluated for impairment, as a percentage of non-impaired loans were   0.97%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.94%   at   December 31, 2015   and   0.98%   at   September 30, 2015  .

  The following tables show the outstanding balances of our loan portfolio and the breakdown of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, by loan type as of and for the periods presented: 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , loans   increased     $176.9 million  , or   4%  , compared to balances outstanding at   December 31, 2015  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , growth in the commercial, financial, agricultural and other portfolio and commercial real estate loans can largely be attributed to growth in middle market lending in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The increase in construction loans is primarily the result of several multifamily and hospitality projects in the Columbus, Cleveland and Pittsburgh markets. Declines in the loans to individuals category is primarily due to a decline in indirect auto loans.  The decrease in residential real estate loans is the result of continued runoff in our mortgage portfolio, as many of the loans originated by our mortgage banking area are sold in the secondary market.

Net charge-offs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $16.4 million  , compared to   $12.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The most significant charge-offs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   include a   $6.5 million   partial charge-off related to a manufacturer of mine safety products, a   $2.0 million   partial charge-off of one loan to an oil and gas wells services company, a   $1.1 million   charge-off of loans related to a manufacturer of sporting goods, a   $1.3 million   partial charge-off of two commercial industrial loans related to a local energy company and a   $1.1 million   charge-off of a loan to a machine manufacturer.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the most significant charge-offs included a $2.3 million partial charge-off of two commercial industrial loans related to a local energy company and a $1.2 million charge-off of a commercial relationship that was transferred to loans held for sale. 

As the above table illustrates, commercial, financial, agricultural and other, residential real estate and commercial real estate loans represented a significant portion of the nonperforming loans as of   September 30, 2016  . See discussions related to the provision for credit losses and loans for more information. 
   
  Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , shareholders  equity was   $751.8 million  , an   increase   of   $32.2 million   from   December 31, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily the result of a   $41.7 million   in net income and an increase of   $9.1 million   in the fair value of available for sale investments.  These increases were partially offset by   $18.7 million   of dividends paid to shareholders and   $0.9 million   of common stock repurchases.  Cash dividends declared per common share were   $0.21   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on First Commonwealth s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of First Commonwealth s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. First Commonwealth s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 
  First Commonwealth maintains capital to absorb unexpected losses. In order to provide assurance that our capital levels are adequate for our risk exposure, we test our capital position under several stress scenarios on an annual basis. This analysis is subject to Board of Director review and approval.  Our most recent capital stress test was completed in December 2015. 
  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company became subject to the new regulatory risk-based capital rules adopted by the federal banking agencies implementing Basel III.  The most significant changes include higher minimum capital requirements, as the minimum Tier I capital ratio increased from 4.0% to 6.0% and a new common equity Tier I capital ratio was established with a minimum level of 4.5%. Additionally, the new rules improve the quality of capital by providing stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provide for a phase-in, beginning January 1, 2016, of a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This buffer provides a requirement to hold common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, resulting in an effective common equity Tier I risk-weighted asset minimum ratio of 7% on a fully phased-in basis.

The Basel III Rules also permit banking organizations with less than $15.0 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Company elected to retain this treatment, which reduces the volatility of regulatory capital levels. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , First Commonwealth and First Commonwealth Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and was considered well-capitalized under the regulatory rules, all on a fully phased-in basis. To be considered well capitalized, the Company must maintain minimum Total risk-based capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Tier I leverage ratio and Common equity tier I risk-based capital as set forth in the table below: 

On February 17, 2016, First Commonwealth's Board of Directors authorized a $25.0 million common stock repurchase program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , First Commonwealth had repurchased   45,612   shares at an average price of   $8.46   per share under this program.  This repurchase program was suspended in July 2016 as a result of the pending acquisition of 13 branches in Ohio, which management believes represents a better use of capital for shareholders. 
    
  On July 27, 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with FirstMerit Bank, NA to acquire 13 retail 
  branches in Canton and Ashtabula, Ohio with approximately $735 million of deposits and $115 million of performing retail and 
  business loans. In September 2016, the necessary regulatory approvals were received from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  On   October 26, 2016  , First Commonwealth Financial Corporation declared a quarterly dividend of   $0.07   per share payable on   November 18, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   November 7, 2016  .  The timing and amount of future dividends are at the discretion of First Commonwealth's Board of Directors based upon, among other factors, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity and current and projected earnings.

Executive is employed hereunder as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Employer reporting to Employer s President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), and as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of FCB, reporting to FCB s CEO, and in such capacity shall use his best energies and abilities in the performance of his duties and in the performance of such other duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by the CEO.

Executive s employment will automatically be extended on September 19, 2018 and on each subsequent September 19 for successive one (1) year periods unless Employer or Executive provides notice in writing to the other party at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of any such term that such party does not intend to extend Executive s employment hereunder for another year.   
  1.03.      Base Salary  .    Subject to Article II hereof, during the term of his employment under this Agreement, Employer will pay Executive compensation at the rate of Three Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($350,000) per annum (the  Base Salary ), payable in accordance with Employer s normal payroll practices in equal monthly installments, less legally required taxes and withholdings and elected deductions.  Executive s Base Salary may be increased but not decreased by the CEO at any time based upon Executive s contributions to the success of Employer and on such other factors as the Board shall deem appropriate.  Executive will be eligible to participate in any Short-Term and Long-Term Incentive Plans that may be offered to executive employees of Employer.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Executive will be eligible to earn (i) a cash incentive award under the Employer s 2017 Annual Incentive Plan ( AIP ) with a target award of 35% of Base Salary and, for purposes of the 2017 AIP only, a guaranteed minimum payout equal to the target award; and (ii) a performance-based

Executive will also be eligible to participate in the Employer s Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan as provided in the documents that govern that plan.   
  1.04.      Employee Benefits  .    Subject to Article II hereof, during the term of his employment under this Agreement, Executive will be eligible to participate in such major medical or health benefit plans, pensions, and other benefits as are available generally to employees of Employer, to the extent available to employees.

  ARTICLE II 
  TERMINATION 
  2.01.       Termination For Cause  .    Employer may terminate Executive s employment and the term of employment under this Agreement at any time for  Cause,  as defined herein, by providing written notice to Executive that his employment is terminated, whereupon Executive s employment with the Employer will be terminated.  Upon delivery of said notice together with payment of any salary accrued under Section 1.03 prior to the date of termination but not yet paid, as well as payment for any accrued vacation time not taken and expenses which were properly incurred by Executive on Employer s behalf prior to the termination date that are not yet paid ( Accrued Obligations ), all obligations of the Employer to Executive shall terminate.  In the event Employer terminates Executive s employment for Cause, Employer will pay all Accrued Obligations to Executive within thirty (30) days following such termination of employment.  Termination shall be deemed to be for Cause if: (i) Executive fails to comply with any material provision of this Agreement; (ii) Executive refuses to comply with any lawful, written directive from the Board; (iii) Executive fails to perform his duties under this Agreement with the degree of skill and care reasonably to be expected of a professional of his experience and stature after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure (unless the failure to perform is incapable of being cured); or (iv) Executive engages in an act of dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude or Executive is convicted of a crime which, in the judgment of the Board, renders his continued employment by Employer materially damaging or detrimental to Employer.  The obligations of Executive under Article III shall continue notwithstanding termination of Executive s employment pursuant to this Section 2.01. If Executive s employment terminates under Section 2.01, he is entitled to no severance under Section 2.05.

2.02.       Termination Without Cause  .   Executive s employment with Employer and FCB and the term of employment under this Agreement may be terminated at any time by Employer without Cause immediately upon written notice by Employer to Executive, whereupon Executive s employment with Employer will be terminated.  In the event Employer terminates Executive s employment without Cause, Employer will pay all Accrued Obligations to Executive within thirty (30) days following such termination of employment and will provide Executive with the Severance Benefits set forth in Section 2.05, provided that as a condition precedent to Executive s receipt of Severance Benefits under this Section 2.02 and Section 2.05, Executive must execute and deliver to Employer a Separation Agreement and General Release (as defined in Section 2.05). All other obligations of Employer to Executive shall cease as of the date of termination.

  2.03.       Resignation for Good Reason  .    Executive may resign from employment with Employer and FCB and terminate the term of employment under this Agreement for Good Reason.  Good Reason means:  (i) a material change in Executive s title, position or responsibilities with Employer or FCB which represents a substantial reduction of the title, position or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the change; (ii) any reduction in the Base Salary or a material reduction of benefits provided under this Agreement (unless such reduction of benefits applies equally to all similarly situated employees of Employer); or (iii) the assignment of Executive to a position which requires him to relocate permanently to a site more than fifty (50) miles outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; or (iv) the assignment to Executive of any duties or responsibilities (other than due to a promotion) which are materially inconsistent with the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Employer and FCB.  Before Executive resigns employment with Employer for Good Reason, Executive must give Employer twenty (20) days  notice of said resignation and an opportunity to correct.  In the event Executive resigns from employment with Employer for Good Reason, Employer will pay all Accrued Obligations to Executive within thirty (30) days following such termination of employment and will provide Executive with the Severance Benefits set forth in Section 2.05, provided that as a condition precedent to Executive s receipt of Severance Benefits under this Section 2.03 and Section 2.05, Executive must execute and deliver to Employer a Separation Agreement and General Release (as defined in Section 2.05).  All other obligations of Employer to Executive shall cease as of the date of termination.  The obligations of Executive under Article III shall continue notwithstanding termination of Executive s employment pursuant to this Section 2.03.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employer corrects within twenty (20) days of its receipt of notice of the Good Reason, Employer shall owe Executive no severance under Section 2.05 and Executive shall be eligible to continue in his capacity as Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of Employer and FCB.   
  2.04.       Termination by Executive  .   Executive agrees to give Employer sixty (60) days  prior written notice of the termination of his employment with Employer. Simultaneously with such notice, Executive shall inform Employer in writing as to his employment plans following the termination of his employment with Employer.  In the event Executive terminates his employment with Employer pursuant to this Section 2.04, Employer will pay all Accrued Obligations to Executive within thirty (30) days following such termination of employment.  All other obligations of Employer to Executive shall cease as of the termination date. The obligations of Executive under Article III shall continue notwithstanding termination of Executive s employment pursuant to this Section 2.04. If Executive s employment terminates under Section 2.04 he is entitled to no severance under Section 2.05.

EX 10.1 

2.05.       Severance Benefits  .   In the event that Employer terminates Executive s employment during the term of this Agreement without Cause pursuant to Section 2.02, or if Executive terminates his employment with Employer during the term of this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.03, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section and subject to Sections 2.02 and/or 2.03 as applicable, Employer will pay to Executive an amount equal to the product of (x) one-twelfth (1/12) of the Base Salary times (y) the greater of (i) twelve or (ii) the number of months remaining in the term, less legally required taxes and withholdings and elected deductions.  Said sum is to be paid in equal periodic installments payable in accordance with Employer s normal payroll practices commencing with the first payroll following Executive s termination of employment, provided, however, that any installments that would otherwise be payable in the six month period following separation from service shall be paid on the day following the six month anniversary of such separation from service in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.02(b) of this Agreement.  Upon termination, Employer will offer continuation coverage to Executive, as required by Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, ( Code ) as amended ( COBRA ), under the First Commonwealth s group health plan (the  Health Plan ) on the terms and conditions mandated by COBRA including Executive s payment of the applicable COBRA premiums and shall pay the full cost of Executive's COBRA premiums for the twelve (12) month period following such separation from service. 
  Employer s obligations to make any payment to Executive as described in this Agreement is contingent upon Executive's execution and non-revocation of a separation agreement and general release of any and all claims and causes of action that Executive may have against Employer, as permitted by law, in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Employer, that, in the opinion of the Employer s counsel, is effective to release the Employer Entities (as defined in Section 3.01) from all claims relating to Executive s employment or the termination thereof (other than under the terms of this Employment Agreement) (a  Separation Agreement and General Release ), and the Employer will have no obligation to make any payment unless and until such Separation Agreement and General Release has become effective.  
  2.06.       Resignation of Board Membership  .   Executive expressly promises and agrees that he will resign from all boards of directors, officer positions, committee memberships and other positions with Employer and each of its subsidiaries immediately upon and concurrent with the termination of his employment with Employer for any reason, including, without limit, by Employer for Cause or without Cause or by Executive for any reason.

acknowledges that it would cause the Employer Entities serious and irreparable injury and cost if Executive were to use his ability and knowledge in breach of the obligations contained in Article III. 
  4.02.       Remedies  .   In the event of a breach by Executive of the terms of this Agreement, Employer shall be entitled, if it shall so elect, to institute legal proceedings to obtain damages for any such breach, or to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by Executive and to enjoin Executive from any further violation of this Agreement and to exercise such remedies cumulatively or in conjunction with all other rights and remedies provided by law. Executive acknowledges, however, that the remedies at law for any breach by him of the provisions of this Agreement may be inadequate and that Employer shall be entitled to injunctive relief against him in the event of any breach.  In addition, in the event that Executive breaches any obligation under this Agreement or any obligation that Executive has to any Employer Entity under common law, or otherwise engages in tortious behavior that damages any Employer Entity in any way, any Employer Entity will have the right to not provide Executive with, or to cease providing Executive with, any amounts or benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to Section 2.05 above. 
  ARTICLE V 
  MISCELLANEOUS 
  5.01.       Authorization to Modify Restrictions  .   It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of Article III shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, but that the unenforceability (or modification to conform to such law) of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder hereof. If any provision or provisions hereof shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the offending provision or provisions and to alter the bounds thereof in order to render it valid and enforceable.

  (a)    This Agreement will be administered, interpreted and construed in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder ( Section 409A ), including any exemption thereunder.  With respect to payments, if any, subject to Section 409A (and not excepted therefrom), each such payment is paid as a result of a permissible distribution event, and at a specified time, consistent with Section 409A.  Executive has no right to, and there shall not be, any acceleration or deferral with respect to payments hereunder.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Employer shall not be liable for, and nothing provided or contained in this Agreement will obligate or cause Employer to be liable for, any tax, interest or penalties imposed on Executive related to or arising with respect to any violation of Section 409A.  For purposes of this Agreement, any reference to  termination of employment ,  termination  or similar reference shall be construed to be a reference to  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A.   
  (b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount payable or benefit to be provided under this Agreement constitutes an amount payable or benefit to be provided under a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan  (as defined in Section 409A) that is not exempt from Section 409A, and such amount or benefit is  
  
   7 

EX 10.1

This six-month delay will cease to be applicable if Executive  separates from service  due to death or if Executive dies before the six-month period has elapsed, in which event any such payments or benefits will be paid or provided to Executive's estate within thirty (30) days of the date of death. 
  5.03.      Entire Agreement  .   This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties and may be amended only by a writing signed by each of them. This Agreement supersedes all other prior arrangements and agreements between the parties, except the Change of Control Agreement and Restricted Stock Agreement referred to herein. In the event that there is a Change of Control as defined by the Change of Control Agreement during the term of this Agreement and there is a Qualifying Termination within the Protected Period, in each case, as defined in the Change of Control Agreement, the provisions of the Change of Control Agreement will apply and this Agreement will cease to apply, and Executive will be entitled to no benefits under this Agreement, including the severance benefits in Section 2.05.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, except as provided in Section 3.07, Executive s obligations under Article III will continue even if there is a Change of Control. 
  5.04.       Governing Law  .   This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, and governed according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law. 
  5.05.       Jurisdiction and Service of Process  .    Executive and Employer waives any right to a court (including jury) proceeding and instead agree to submit any dispute over the application, interpretation, validity, or any other aspect of this Agreement to binding arbitration consistent with the application of the Federal Arbitration Act and the procedural rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) before an arbitrator who is a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators ( NAA ) out of a nationwide panel of eleven (11) arbitrators to be supplied by the AAA.  Employer will absorb the fee charged and the expenses incurred by the neutral arbitrator selected. 
  5.06.       Agreement Binding  .   The obligations of Executive under Article III of this Agreement shall continue after the termination of his employment with the Employer Entities for any reason and shall be binding on his heirs, executors, legal representatives and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of any successors and assigns of the Employer Entities. Likewise, the obligations of Employer shall be binding upon any successors.

  WHEREAS,   the Compensation Committee has authorized the Company to enter into this Change of Control Agreement with the Executive; and

   6 

EX 10.2 

payments and benefits pursuant to Article 3 hereof will be reduced, in the manner determined by independent tax counsel selected as provided below, by the amount, if any, which is the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits under Article 3 hereof being non-deductible to the Company or such subsidiary pursuant to Section 280G of the Code and subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code; provided, however, that if such procedure for determining the reduction of payments and benefits is determined by the Company to result in a violation of Section 409A, such reduction will be made on a pro rata basis. The determination of whether any reduction in the payments and benefits is to be made pursuant to Article 3 hereof will be based upon the written advice of independent tax counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive. The fees and expenses of the tax counsel will be paid by the Company. The Company will use its best efforts to cause such counsel to prepare the foregoing opinion as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within thirty (30) days after the Change of Control or date of Qualifying Termination, if earlier.

  Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and Grantee agree as follows:  
  1.  Award of Stock  .  The Company hereby grants to the Grantee 33,000 shares of Restricted Stock (the  Shares ), subject to the terms set forth herein and to the terms and provisions of the First Commonwealth Financial Corporation Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Plan ) applicable to Restricted Stock, which terms and provisions are incorporated herein by this reference.  Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same meanings herein. 
  2.  Restriction on Transfer.   Except for the escrow described in Section 5 hereof or the transfer of the Shares to the Company as contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Shares or any beneficial interest therein shall be transferred, encumbered, pledged or otherwise alienated or disposed of in any way until the Shares become nonforfeitable in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.  
  3.  Vesting and Forfeiture  . The Shares are subject to forfeiture to the Company until such time as they become nonforfeitable as set forth in this Section 3.  
  (a)        The Shares will become nonrestricted and nonforfeitable as follows, unless earlier forfeited in accordance with this Section 3: 
   
   1 

    EX 10.3 

(b)        If the Grantee s employment is terminated (i) by the Company other than for  Cause  (as defined in the Employment Agreement), (ii) by Grantee for  Good Reason  (as defined in the Employment Agreement ), or (iii) as a result of Grantee s death or Disability, any Shares which have not as of the termination of Grantee s employment become nonforfeitable will immediately and automatically, without any action on the part of the Company, become nonforfeitable.  
  (c)        If the Grantee s employment is terminated (i) by the Company for Cause, or (ii) by Grantee for other than Good Reason, any Shares which have not as of the termination of Grantee s employment become nonforfeitable will immediately and automatically be forfeited.  
  (d)        Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, if a Change in Control occurs while the Grantee is an Employee, then any Shares which have not become nonforfeitable will immediately and automatically, without any action on the part of the Company, become nonforfeitable as of the date of the Change in Control.  
  4.  Share Legends  . The following legend will be placed on any certificates evidencing Shares which remain subject to forfeiture, in addition to any other legends that may be required to be placed on such certificates pursuant to applicable law, the Plan or otherwise:  
  THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN AND A RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SHAREHOLDER NAMED ON THE FACE OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION (WHICH TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FORFEITURE CONDITIONS AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS). A COPY OF THAT AGREEMENT IS ON FILE IN THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE WITHOUT CHARGE UPON REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION.  
  Where a book-entry system is used with respect to the issuance of Shares, appropriate notation of such forfeiture possibility and transfer restrictions will be made on the system with respect to the account or accounts to which the Shares are credited. 
  
   2 

    EX 10.3 

5.  Escrow of Shares  .  
  (a)        Certificates evidencing the Shares issued under this Agreement will be held in escrow by the Secretary of the Company or his or her designee (the  Escrow Holder ) until such Shares cease to be subject to forfeiture in accordance with Section 3, at which time the Escrow Holder will deliver such certificates representing the nonforfeitable Shares to the Grantee; provided, however, that no certificates for Shares will be delivered to the Grantee until appropriate arrangements have been made with the Company for the withholding or payment of any taxes that may be due with respect to such Shares.  
  (b)        If any of the Shares are forfeited by the Grantee, the Escrow Holder will deliver the stock certificate(s) evidencing those Shares to the Company, which will then have the right to retain and transfer those Shares to its own name free and clear of any rights of the Grantee under this Agreement or otherwise.  
  (c)        The Escrow Holder is hereby directed to permit transfer of the Shares only in accordance with this Agreement or in accordance with instructions which are consistent with this Agreement which are signed by both parties.  In the event further instructions are reasonably desired by the Escrow Holder, he or she shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon directions given by the Committee.  The Escrow Holder shall have no liability for any act or omissions hereunder while acting in good faith in the exercise of his or her own judgment.  
  6.  Rights of Grantee  . The Grantee shall have the right to vote the Shares and to receive dividends with respect to the Shares, subject to Section 7.  
  7.  Stock Splits, etc  . If, while any of the Shares remain subject to forfeiture, there occurs any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares, or other similar change in the Company s common stock, then any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other consideration to which the Grantee is entitled by reason of the Grantee s ownership of the Shares will be immediately subject to this Agreement, deposited with the Escrow Holder and included thereafter as  Shares  for purpose of this Agreement.  
  8.  Tax Withholding  . Grantee shall be required to deposit with the Company an amount of cash equal to the amount determined by the Company to be required with respect to any withholding taxes, FICA contributions, or the like under any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation in connection with the vesting or award of the Shares.  Alternatively, the Company may, at Grantee s election, (i) withhold the required amounts from Grantee s pay during the pay periods next following the date on which any such applicable tax liability otherwise arises, or (ii) withhold a number of Shares otherwise deliverable having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy the statutory minimum of all or part of Grantee s estimated total federal, state, and local tax obligations associated with the vesting or award of the Shares. 
  
   3 

    EX 10.3 

9.  83(b) Election  .  Grantee hereby acknowledges that he may file an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed currently on the fair market value of the Shares (less any purchase price paid for the Shares), provided that such election must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service   no later than thirty (30) days   after the grant of such Shares.  Grantee will seek the advice of his own tax advisors as to the advisability of making such a Section 83(b) election, the potential consequences of making such an election, the requirements for making such an election, and the other tax consequences of this Award under federal, state, and any other laws that may be applicable. The Company and its Subsidiaries and agents have not and are not providing any tax advice to Grantee. 
  10.  Limitation on Rights; No Right to Future Grants; Extraordinary Item.      By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, Grantee acknowledges that:  (a) Grantee's participation in the Plan is voluntary; and (b)  the Award is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without limitation for calculating any benefits, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and Grantee will not be entitled to compensation or damages as a consequence of Grantee's forfeiture of any unvested portion of the Award as a result of Grantee's separation from service with the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason.   
  11.  General Provisions  :  
  (a)        This Agreement, together with the Plan, constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and the Grantee regarding the grant of the Shares.  
  (b)        The Committee may modify this Agreement to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation or exchange listing requirement.  Any other amendment to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Company and the Grantee.   
  (c)        Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue the Grantee s relationship as an Employee or to modify any agreement between the Grantee and the Company or its Subsidiaries relating thereto.  
  (d)        The Committee may from time to time impose any conditions on the Shares as it deems reasonably necessary to ensure that the Plan and this Award satisfy the conditions of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that Shares are issued and resold in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  
  (e)        The Grantee agrees upon request execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.  
  (f)        Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and the Plan s prospectus and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof. The terms of the Plan as it presently exists, and as it may hereafter be amended, are deemed incorporated  
  
   4 

    EX 10.3 

herein by reference, and in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of this Agreement.  
  (g)        This Agreement shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to the application of the principals of conflicts or choice of laws.  
  (h)        This Agreement may be executed, including execution by facsimile signature, in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.  
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Restricted Stock Agreement as of the day and year first set forth above.
