DIAMONDHEAD CASINO CORPORATION

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

Note 1. Organization and Business

Diamondhead Casino Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") own a total of approximately 404.5 acres of unimproved land in Diamondhead, Mississippi on which the Company plans, unilaterally, or in conjunction with one or more partners, to construct a casino resort and hotel and associated amenities.

Note 2. Liquidity and Going Concern

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no operations and generates no operating revenues. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company incurred net losses applicable to common shareholders, exclusive of the recording of change in the fair value of derivatives, of $631,919 and $1,574,751, respectively.

The Company has had no operations since it ended its gambling cruise ship operations in 2000. Since that time, the Company has concentrated its efforts on the development of its Diamondhead, Mississippi Property.   The development of the Diamondhead Property is dependent on obtaining the necessary capital, through equity and/or debt financing, unilaterally, or in conjunction with one or more partners, to master plan, design, obtain permits for, construct, staff, open, and operate a casino resort.

In the past, in order to raise capital to continue to pay on-going costs and expenses, the Company has borrowed funds, through Private Placements of convertible instruments and other means, which are more fully described in Notes 5, 6 and 7 to these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Some of these instruments are past due for payment of both principal and interest. In addition, at September 30, 2016, the Company had current liabilities totaling $6,483,340 and only $47,100 cash on hand.

The above conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures included in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this document have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, reflect all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP and SEC regulations for interim financial statements. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that we will have for any subsequent period.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, attached as Exhibit 99.1 to our annual report on Form 10-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Diamondhead Casino Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements to conform to the unaudited condensed consolidated 2016 financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net earnings or cash flows as previously reported.

Land Held for Development

Land held for development is carried at cost. Costs directly related to site development, such as licenses, permitting, engineering, and other costs, are capitalized.

Land development costs, which have been capitalized, consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Fair Value Measurements

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements" for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Input other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

Level 3: Unobservable input that reflects   management's own assumptions.

6 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table listed below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending net balances for the derivative liability measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Sensitivity Analysis to Changes in Level 3 Assumptions

Significant inputs include the dates when required conditions are expected to be met under the conversion terms of the debentures, the underlying market cap due to borrowings and losses and discount for lack of marketability while the stock was delisted and reversed when the Company's stock became publicly listed again on or about October 26, 2015. In addition, use of different ranges of bond discount rates and changes in historical volatility rates would also result in a higher or lower fair value.

Current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments and management believes that their carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their short term nature.

The convertible debentures and derivative liability approximate fair value based on Level 3 inputs, as further discussed in Note 7.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows projected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of such assets determined by appraisal, discounted cash flow projections, or other means. No impairment existed at September 30, 2016.

Net Loss per Common Share

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding consist of issued shares, including allocated and committed shares held by the ESOP trust, less shares held in treasury. The dilutive securities below do not include 5,055,555 potentially convertible Debentures since the requirements for possible conversion have not yet, and may never be, met.

The table below summarizes the components of potential dilutive securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Stock Based Compensation

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation" which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards either modified or granted to employees and directors based upon estimated fair values. In the third quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors voted to extend the expiration date of a previously-awarded option to the President to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock at $0.30 per share from October 27, 2015 to March 13, 2018 and voted to extend the expiration date of a previously-awarded option to the President to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at $0.75 per share from October 27, 2015 to March 13, 2018. In addition, in the third quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors voted to extend the expiration date of a previously-awarded option granted to the current Chairman to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at $1.25 per share, from October 27, 2015 to March 13, 2018 and to extend the expiration date of a previously-awarded option to purchase common stock granted to a Director of the Company to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at $0.75, from October 27, 2015 to March 13, 2018. The Company also extended the expiration date on options issued to former employees of the Company and an Honorary Director of the Company to purchase a combined total of 90,000 shares of common stock at $0.75 per share, from October 27, 2015 to March 13, 2018.

In determining the fair value of each option modified, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, was used. The valuations were determined using the weighted-average assumptions of 0% dividend yield, expected volatility of 209% and risk-free interest rates ranging from 0.027 to 0.97%. This resulted in a charge to the statement of loss in the amount of $295,222, increasing the loss per share of common stock $0.008 for the nine months ending September 30, 2015.

Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. The Company uses projected volatility rates, which are based upon historical volatility rates, trended into future years. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company's options.

Note 4 .  Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 

The table below outlines the elements included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Note 5.  Convertible Notes and Line of Credit

Line of Credit

On October 23, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for an unsecured Line of Credit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. The Line of Credit provided for funds to be drawn as needed and carries an interest rate on amounts borrowed of 9% per annum, originally payable quarterly, based on the pro rata number of days outstanding. All funds originally advanced under the facility were due and payable by November 1, 2012. As an inducement to provide the facility, the lender was awarded an immediate option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $1.75 per share. In addition, the lender received an option to purchase a maximum of 250,000 additional shares of common stock of the Company at $1.75 per share. The options expire following repayment in full by the Company of the amount borrowed. At September 30, 2016, the principal and accrued interest due on the obligation, which totals $1,650,984, remains unpaid.

Convertible Notes and Warrants

Pursuant to a Private Placement Memorandum dated March 1, 2010, the Company offered Units consisting of a two year unsecured, convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $25,000 with interest at 12% per annum, together with a five year Warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The Promissory Note is convertible into 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company immediately upon issuance at the option of the investor. The five-year Warrants issued in connection with the Units have expired.

Pursuant to an additional Private Placement Memorandum dated October 25, 2010, the Company offered Units consisting of a two year unsecured, convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $25,000, together with a five year Warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The Promissory Notes bear interest at 9% per annum and are convertible into 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company immediately upon issuance at the option of the investor. The five-year Warrants issued in connection with the Units have expired.

The Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the Private Placements discussed above total $962,500 and became due and payable beginning in March 2012 and extending at various dates through June 2013. As of the date of the filing of this report, all of the aforementioned debt obligations remain unpaid and in default under the repayment terms of the notes.

The table below summarizes the Company's debt arising from the above-described sources as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Note 6. Notes Payable

In the first four months of 2016, the Company received cash advances totaling $47,500 from seven lenders which included $25,000 from three current Directors of the Company:  Proceeds from the cash advances were earmarked for the payment of accounting and auditing fees and other expenses required to file the Company's Form 10-Q.  On August 25, 2016, the Company issued a Note to the foregoing lenders which bears interest at 8% per annum, with a full year of interest accruing in any year in which the advance remains unpaid, and matures four years from the date of issuance.  The Company will file a lien on its Mississippi property in favor of the note holders to secure both principle and interest owed.

In the third quarter of 2016, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company loaned the Company an additional $90,000. On August 25, 2016, the Company issued a Note to the Chairman of the Board. The Note bears interest at 14% per annum effective August 1, 2016 and matures four years from the date of issuance. The proceeds of the loan were used for the payment of Mississippi property taxes, and auditing, accounting and other corporate expenses. The Company will file a lien on its Mississippi property in favor of the Chairman to secure both principle and interest owed.

The principal due under the foregoing loans totals $137,500. A lien in the amount of $250,000 will be placed on the Company's Mississippi property to secure the principal and interest due on the debt. The lien to be placed on the Mississippi property will be second to the existing first lien on the Mississippi property in the amount of $3.85 million. The first lien is held by holders of previously-issued convertible and non-convertible Debentures ($1.85 million) and certain executives and directors ($2 million), as outlined in Note 9.

The table below summarizes the Company's long term notes payable as of September 30, 2016:

Note 7. Convertible Debentures and Derivative Liability

Pursuant to a Private Placement Memorandum dated February 14, 2014 (the "Private Placement"), the Company offered up to a maximum of $3,000,000 of Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures in three tranches of $1,000,000 each, to accredited or institutional investors.  The Offering was conducted contingent on the deposit into Escrow of the purchase price for all of the Debentures offered in the principal amount of $3,000,000.  The Debentures, once issued, bear interest at 4% per annum after 180 days ,  mature six years from the date of issuance, and are secured by a lien on the Company's Mississippi property.  On March 31, 2014, the First Closing occurred when subscriptions in the amount of $3,000,000 were received in Escrow and accepted by the Company. The Escrow Agent released $1,000,000 to the Company and the Company issued First Tranche Debentures in the aggregate principle amount of $1,000,000. 

On December 31, 2014, investors who had purchased $950,000 of First Tranche Debentures consented to  Amendment I to the Private Placement, which amended certain terms and conditions, including the conversion terms of the First Tranche Debentures. The remaining First Tranche Debenture in the amount of $50,000 remains as originally issued with no conversion rights. Thus, the First Tranche Debentures can be converted into a total of 3,166,666 shares of common stock.

10 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

On December 31, 2014, the Second Closing occurred when investors representing $850,000 of Second Tranche Debentures consented to Amendment II to the Private Placement, which amended certain terms and conditions, including those relating to issuance and conversion of the Second and Third Tranche Debentures, as well as the period of time within which to perform the Third Tranche Closing Obligations, as amended.   The Escrow Agent released $850,000 to the Company and the Company issued Second Tranche Debentures in the aggregate principle amount of $850,000. Thus, the Second Tranche Debentures can be converted into a total of 1,888,889 shares of common stock. The Escrow Agent refunded $300,000 to those investors who did not consent to Amendment II. 

The Company did not meet the closing obligations for the Third Tranche Debentures as of June 30, 2015, as was required, pursuant to the terms of the Private Placement, as amended. Therefore, the remaining $850,000 being held in escrow for the purchase of the Third Tranche Debentures was returned to the investors in July 2015.

For purposes of determining the proper accounting treatment and valuation of the instruments, the Company applied the provisions set forth in ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value in Financial Instruments" and ASC Topic 815, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  Since the Notes issued have derivative features, the embedded derivatives should be bundled and valued as a single, compound embedded derivative, bifurcated from the debt host and treated as a liability. In addition, the valuation is required to be conducted for each reporting period the instrument is in existence.

The Company's stock was not trading from approximately September 4, 2014, when its stock registration was revoked, through approximately October 26, 2015, when its' stock began to trade again. The Company engaged an independent valuation expert to determine the fair value of its shares of common stock for each quarter beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2014. For periods from September 30, 2014 through September 30, 2015, the fair value of the common stock was estimated by adjusting the most recent market price by changes in the underlying market cap due to changes in the value of net assets and applying a discount for lack of marketability inasmuch as the stock was not trading. After the stock began to trade again on or about October 26, 2015, the closing price of the stock was used in the valuation beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2015 through this most recent valuation at September 30, 2016. Monte Carlo models were developed to value the derivative liability within the Notes using a historical volatility rate, based on comparable companies, of 168% at September 30, 2016 and 132% at December 31, 2015, and using discount bond rates based on the expected remaining term of each instrument ranging from 5.62% to 6.39% at September 30, 2016 and 6.45% to 7.07% at December 31, 2015. In addition, the valuation assumed that conversion requirements for Tranche 1 Debentures, exclusive of price, were met as of September 30, 2016, while conversion requirements for Tranche 2 Debentures were expected to be met by December 31, 2016 for the September 30, 2016 calculation.

The estimated   fair value for the derivative liability relating to each Debenture at the balance sheet dates is as follows:

At the initial valuation date of each Tranche, a portion of the derivative liability was allocated to the Convertible Debentures as debt discount, with the remainder being recorded as other income/expense. At March 31, 2014, the initial valuation of the First Tranche Debentures, $1,000,000 was allocated to debt discount and, at December 31, 2014, the initial valuation of the Second Tranche Debentures, $850,000 was allocated to debt discount. The debt discount is subsequently amortized to expense using an effective interest methodology.   Amortization of debt discount amounted to $48,146 and $34,574 for Convertible Debentures and $1,659 and $801 for the non-convertible Debenture for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The interest payment on these Debentures for the calendar year 2015 in the approximate amount of $57,000 was due March 1, 2016. The Company failed to make the payment. This failure, if continuing, could represent an event of default under the terms of the Debenture.

On October 25, 2016,     certain Debenture holders     filed     a Complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware     for monies due and owing pursuant to certain Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures issued on March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2014  .   The plaintiffs are seeking $1.4 million,     plus interest from January 1, 2015,     together with costs and fees.  The Company was served with the Complaint on October 31, 2016. The Company's Answer and responsive pleadings are due November 21, 2016. 

Note 8.  Related Party Transactions

As of September 30, 2016, the President of the Company is owed deferred salary in the amount of $1,491,996. As of September 30, 2016, a Vice President and the current Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company is owed deferred salary in the amount of $121,140. The Board of directors agreed to pay interest at 9% per annum on the foregoing amounts owed. Interest expense under this agreement amounted to $100,390 and $82,797 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total interest accrued under this agreement totaled $483,366 and $382,976 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Effective September 1, 2011, the Company entered into a month-to-month lease with the President and then-Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, for office space in a furnished and fully equipped townhouse office building owned by the President in Alexandria, Virginia. The lease calls for monthly base rent in the amount of $4,534 and payment of associated costs of insurance, real estate taxes, utilities and other expenses. Rent expense associated with this lease amounted to base rent in the amount of $40,806 and associated rental costs of $9,303 for a total of $50,109 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and base rent in the amount of $40,806 and associated rental costs of $9,973 for a total of $50,779 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the first nine months of 2016, the Company paid only $27,204 of the base rent due for that period. In the first nine months of 2015, the Company paid $36,272 for base rent. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company reimbursed the President for associated rental costs totaling $7,744 which had been paid personally by the President in prior periods. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounts owing for base rent and associated rental costs totaled $92,218 and $74,654, respectfully.

Directors of the Company are entitled to a director's fee of $15,000 per year for their services. The Company has been unable to pay directors' fees to date. A total of $288,750 and $221,250 was due and owing to the Company's current and former directors as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Directors have previously been compensated and may, in the future, be compensated for their services with cash, common stock, or options to purchase common stock of the Company.

In June of 2016, the Company paid a Director $15,000 in connection with his efforts associated with certain litigation which resulted in the Company collecting net settlement proceeds of $150,000 in the second quarter of 2016.

In the second quarter of 2016, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President advanced funds to the Company totaling $15,000 with no interest, contingent upon an assignment of $15,000 from the above-referenced settlement proceeds.   These advances were repaid to them in the second quarter of 2016.

In re Diamondhead Casino Corporation (United States Bankruptcy Court)(District of Delaware)(Case No. 15-11647-LSS)

On August 6, 2015, an Involuntary Petition was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court by three promissory note holders under title 11, United States Code, requesting an order for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The three creditors listed combined claims of $150,000 in principal, plus interest due on certain promissory notes. On August 28, 2015, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petition or, in the Alternative, to Convert the Case to Chapter 11 (the "Motion to Dismiss"). The Company maintained that the Petition was filed in bad faith by supporters of the dissident slate which lost the proxy contest that was decided by the stockholders on June 8, 2015 and that it was filed in retaliation for the Company's refusal, following the stockholders' vote, to place several of the losing dissident's nominees on the Board of Directors. On September 11, 15 and 17, 2015, three additional promissory note holders filed Joinders to the Involuntary Petition listing additional combined claims of $237,500 plus interest. The Company does not recognize one of the joining petitioners as a bona fide creditor of the Company.  On September 17, 2015, the six Petitioners, who were represented by the same attorneys, filed an Objection to the Company's Motion to Dismiss. On September 18, 2015, the six Petitioners filed an Emergency Motion for Entry of an Order Directing the Appointment of (I) an Interim Chapter 7 Trustee, or (II) alternatively, a Chapter 11 Trustee Should the Involuntary Case be converted (the "Emergency Motion").  The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Emergency Motion in October 2015. On November 13, 2015, the Court denied the Petitioners' Emergency Motion as it related to the request for an interim Chapter 7 trustee. On January 15, 2016, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Company's Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petitions. The parties filed briefs in support of and in opposition to the motion.

On June 7, 2016, the Court entered an Order granting the Company's Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petitions. In its accompanying Opinion, the Court found, in part, that based on the totality of the circumstances, the Creditors' primary concern in filing the involuntary petition was to effect a change in management to benefit their investments as stockholders, which was not a proper purpose for filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition. On June 30, 2016, the Company filed a Motion for an Award of Fees and Expenses and Punitive Damages.  On August 11, 2016, the Petitioning Creditors filed an Opposition to the Company's Motion for an Award of Fees and Expenses and Punitive Damages. On August 31, 2016, the Court entered an Order awarding judgment to the Company for attorneys' fees and expenses against the Petitioners, jointly and severally, in the amount of $54,886. On September 1, 2016, the Court filed an Amended Order in which it further stated that the amounts awarded were not subject to any setoff against amounts owed by the Company to the Petitioners. The Petitioners have failed, to date, to pay the Company any amounts due pursuant to this Amended Order.

On October 25, 2016,     the above-named Debenture holders     filed     a Complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware     for monies due and owing pursuant to certain Collateralized Convertible Senior Debentures issued on March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2014  .   The plaintiffs are seeking $1.4 million,     plus interest from January 1, 2015,     together with costs and fees.  The Company was served with the Complaint on October 31, 2016. The Company's Answer and responsive pleadings are due November 21, 2016.

Litigation Settlement

In the second quarter of 2016, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mississippi Gaming Corporation, entered into confidential settlement agreements with an unrelated third party for aggregate gross proceeds in the total amount of $225,000. The attorneys' fees amounted to one-third of the gross amount of the recovery, or $75,000, and the Company recorded net income in the amount of $150,000. The attorneys waived all expenses incurred in connection with the litigation. In June of 2016, the Company paid a Director, who was not an officer of the Company, $15,000 from these net proceeds for his efforts associated with the litigation.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Company failed to file information returns required to be filed in connection with its Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") for the 2015 calendar year in a timely fashion. The filings were due to be filed with the Department of Labor by October 15, 2016. The Company did not have sufficient funds to pay professionals to audit its ESOP and/or prepare and file required documents and forms when due. Although these required filings normally do not result in any tax due to an agency of the government, the Company could be subject to penalties for failure to file these forms when due. The Company intends to bring its ESOP-required filings current and when current, will attempt to enroll in a voluntary compliance program with the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any penalties or fines incurred. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to enroll in any such program or obtain a reduction of the fines and penalties that may be due.

Reversal of Previously Accrued Department of Labor Penalties

On June 2, 2016, the Company electronically filed annual reports with the Department of Labor ("DOL") required to be filed by its Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Each of the annual reports filed was delinquent. The Company filed its Annual Reports pursuant to the Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program ("DFVCP"). The Program allows Plans that have not previously been notified by the DOL of a failure to file a timely annual report, to voluntarily file their delinquent reports and pay a significantly reduced penalty than would have otherwise been assessed had the Company been unable to take advantage of the Program. The Company electronically paid penalties prescribed under the Program with its filings in the amount of $4,000.

In prior reporting periods, the Company accrued significant amounts in anticipation of potential penalties that could have been assessed by the Department of Labor for failure to file the ESOP's annual reports. The Company believes it has now complied with the DFVCP by filing its delinquent reports and paying the prescribed penalty due under the Program. Therefore, the Company reversed the existing accrual of anticipated penalties and recorded income in the amount of $240,050 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

Forward Looking Statements

This section should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2015, attached as Exhibit 99.1 to our annual report filed on Form 10-K.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the Company's future plans, business strategy, expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, and business prospects. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our ability to implement our business plan and business strategy, our ability to obtain financing to sustain the Company, our ability to finance our future development and future operations, our ability to attract key personnel, and our ability to operate profitably in the future. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Any statements contained in this document that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements as those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as "may", "will", "should", "expects", "anticipates", "contemplates", "estimates", "believes", "assumes", "intends", "plans", "projects", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these or similar terms. In evaluating these forward-looking statements, you should consider risks and uncertainties relating to various factors, including, but not limited to, financing, licensing, construction and development, competition, legal actions, federal, state, county and/or city government actions, general financing conditions, and general economic conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The Company's actual results may differ significantly from results projected in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements

Throughout this report references to "we", "our", "us", "Diamondhead Casino Corporation", the "Company", and similar terms refer to Diamondhead Casino Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

Overview

The Company's current priority is the development of a casino resort on its Property located in Diamondhead, Mississippi. The Company's management, financial resources and assets will be devoted towards the development of this property. There can be no assurance that the property can be developed or, that if developed, that the project will be successful.

Liquidity

The Company has no operations, generates no revenues and has been dependent on various short term financings to raise sufficient cash to satisfy the expenses it incurs. The Company is concentrating its efforts on the development of its Diamondhead, Mississippi Property .  The development of the Diamondhead property is dependent on obtaining the necessary capital, through equity and/or debt financing, unilaterally, or in conjunction with one or more partners, to master plan, design, obtain permits for, construct, staff, open, and operate a casino resort. In the past, the Company has been able to sustain itself through various short term borrowing, however, at September 30, 2016, the Company's cash on hand amounted to $47,100, while current liabilities totaled $6,483,340. Therefore, in order to sustain itself, it is imperative that the Company secure a source of funds to provide further working capital. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain such funding.

In addition, a line of credit in the amount of $1,000,000 obtained in October 2008, was payable in November 2012. Also, convertible notes issued pursuant to two Private Placements offered in 2010, totaling $962,500 at September 30, 2016, had become payable beginning in March 2012 and extending at various dates through June 2013. As of the date of the filing of this report, none of the aforementioned debt obligations have been satisfied and the Company is in default of the repayment terms of the notes. In addition, payment of accrued interest due on Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 Debentures issued in 2014, in the approximate amount of $57,000, was due and payable effective March 1, 2016, but remains unpaid.

The above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Financial Results and Analysis

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred net losses applicable to common stockholders, exclusive of the recording of change in the fair value of derivatives, of $631,919 and $1,574,751, respectively. However, the Company recorded an increase in the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $218,023 which increased the net loss applicable to common stockholders to $849,942 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Conversely, the Company recorded a decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $788,511, which decreased the net loss applicable to common stockholders to $786,240 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Administrative and general expenses incurred totaled $509,550 and $822,502 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The table below depicts the major categories comprising these expenses:

16 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The decrease in payroll and related taxes in the amount of $150,432 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus 2015 was the result of the resignation of the former Chairman, who served as President of Casino World, Inc., effective June 8, 2015. The President of the Company has received no payment for services rendered in 2016. Payroll to date in 2016 has been accrued and is unpaid.

Director fees increased $3,750 due to the addition of Directors.

Administrative and general expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were impacted by expenses associated with an annual meeting in the amount of $61,711 and a land valuation fee in the amount of $12,500. No comparable expenses were incurred in those categories during the first nine months of 2016. In addition, in the first nine months of 2015, the Company incurred significant professional fees in connection with various lawsuits, the filing of a registration statement, and an annual meeting of stockholders. In 2016, the Company incurred significantly lower costs for professional fees.

Other Income and Expense

The net loss, exclusive of recording the change in the derivative liability, incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was significantly lower than the first nine months of the prior year due to the two following, nonrecurring items, which occurred during that period of time.

The Company settled certain litigation in the second quarter of 2016 which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $150,000.  In addition, the Company filed previously delinquent filings associated with its Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2014 with the Department of Labor ("DOL"). In the absence of the filings, the Company could have been subjected to extensive penalties associated with those delinquencies and had accrued a provision for that possibility in prior financial statements. The Company believes it has now complied with the DOL's Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program and, therefore, recaptured $240,050 of previously-accrued expense related to this matter.

Interest expense incurred totaled $305,122 and $264,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $40,559. The increase in 2016 is primarily attributable to the impact of accrued interest on the Second Tranche Debentures which, under the terms of these Debentures, only began accruing interest on June 29, 2015, coupled with interest expense associated with the 8% notes payable borrowed in the first and second quarter of 2016, which accrued a full year of interest at their inception.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Management Agreement

On June 19, 1993, two subsidiaries of the Company, Casino World Inc. and Mississippi Gaming Corporation, entered into a Management Agreement with Casinos Austria Maritime Corporation ("CAMC").  Subject to certain conditions, under the Management Agreement, CAMC would operate, on an exclusive basis, all of the Company's proposed dockside gaming casinos in the State of Mississippi, including any operation fifty percent (50%) or more of which is owned by the Company or its affiliates. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, the Agreement terminates five years from the first day of actual Mississippi gaming operations and provides for the payment of an annual operational term management fee of 1.2% of all gross gaming revenues between zero and $100,000,000; plus 0.75% of gross gaming revenue between $100,000,000 and $140,000,000; plus 0.5% of gross gaming revenue above $140,000,000; plus two percent of the net gaming revenue between zero and $25,000,000; plus three percent of the net gaming revenue above twenty-five million dollars $25,000,000.  The Company believes this Agreement is no longer in effect. However, there can be no assurance that CAMC will not attempt to maintain otherwise which would lead to litigation.

There are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that are material to our stockholders.

Critical Accounting Policies

Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements" for financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Input other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

Level 3: Unobservable input that reflects   management's own assumptions.

18 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table listed below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending net balances for the derivative liability measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Sensitivity Analysis to Changes in Level 3 Assumptions

Significant inputs include the dates when required conditions are expected to be met under the conversion terms of the debentures, the underlying market cap due to borrowings and losses and discount for lack of marketability while the stock was delisted and reversed when the Company's stock became publicly listed again on or about October 26, 2015. In addition, use of different ranges of bond discount rates and changes in historical volatility rates would also result in a higher or lower fair value.

Current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments and management believes that their carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to their short term nature.

The convertible debentures and derivative liability approximate fair value based on Level 3 inputs.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows projected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of such assets determined by appraisal, discounted cash flow projections, or other means. No impairment existed at September 30, 2016.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

The Company currently is not subject to any trading or non-trading market risk-sensitive instruments. The note payable and the long-term debt listed on the Company's balance sheet are at fixed interest rates and, therefore, are not market risk-sensitive.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of our   Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as Chief Financial Officer,   carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's Rules and Forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the results of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2016.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that are expected to materially affect, or are  reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

College Health   Investment, L.P. v. Diamondhead Casino Corporation (Delaware Superior Court)(C.A. No. N15C-01-119-WCC)

On January 15, 2015, the plaintiff, a beneficial owner of in excess of 5% of the common stock of the Company, filed suit for breach of a Promissory Note issued March 25, 2010, in the principle amount of $150,000, with interest payable at 12% per annum, with a maturity date of March 25, 2012. Plaintiff seeks payment of principle of $150,000, interest due through December 31, 2014 in the amount of $45,000, and interest due of 12% per annum from December 31, 2014 until entry of judgment. The Note, as well as the accrued interest thereon, are shown as current liabilities on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2015. On January 22, 2015, the defendant forwarded a Notice of Conversion to plaintiff, exercising the Borrower's right to convert the principal and any interest due on the Note into common stock. On February 11, 2015, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint as moot.

On March 14, 2015, the plaintiff, a beneficial owner of in excess of 5% of the common stock of the Company, filed a Verified Complaint, with a Verification signed by the plaintiff's General Partner, Samuel I. Burstyn. In Count I, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty of disclosure. In Count II, the plaintiff alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and care. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, but no monetary damages other than attorney's fees. The defendants believe that plaintiff's claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.  In addition, on or about July 30, 2015, the defendant directors filed Defendants' Answer and Verified Counterclaims for defamation, breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. On August 19, 2015, the plaintiff filed a Motion to Dismiss the Counterclaims. As noted above, on or about July 7, 2015, the Plaintiff filed a Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and Reimbursement of Expenses in the total amount of $150,000 in this case and the above-referenced case.  On or about August 26, 2015, the defendants filed an Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for an Award of Fees and Reimbursement of Expenses.  On September 25, 2015, the parties entered into a Stipulation and [Proposed] Order Staying Litigation pending the below-referenced bankruptcy action  (Case No. 15-11647)  which has now concluded.

In re Diamondhead Casino Corporation (United States Bankruptcy Court)(District of Delaware)(Case No. 15-11647-LSS)

On August 6, 2015, an Involuntary Petition was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court by three promissory note holders under title 11, United States Code, requesting an order for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The three creditors listed combined claims of $150,000 in principal, plus interest due on certain promissory notes. On August 28, 2015, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petition or, in the Alternative, to Convert the Case to Chapter 11 (the "Motion to Dismiss"). The Company maintained that the Petition was filed in bad faith by supporters of the dissident slate which lost the proxy contest that was decided by the stockholders on June 8, 2015 and that it was filed in retaliation for the Company's refusal, following the stockholders' vote, to place several of the losing dissident's nominees on the Board of Directors. On September 11, 15 and 17, 2015, three additional promissory note holders filed Joinders to the Involuntary Petition listing additional combined claims of $237,500 plus interest. The Company does not recognize one of the joining petitioners as a bona fide creditor of the Company.  On September 17, 2015, the six Petitioners, who were represented by the same attorneys, filed an Objection to the Company's Motion to Dismiss. On September 18, 2015, the six Petitioners filed an Emergency Motion for Entry of an Order Directing the Appointment of (I) an Interim Chapter 7 Trustee, or (II) alternatively, a Chapter 11 Trustee Should the Involuntary Case be converted (the "Emergency Motion").  The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Emergency Motion in October 2015. On November 13, 2015, the Court denied the Petitioners' Emergency Motion as it related to the request for an interim Chapter 7 trustee. On January 15, 2016, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Company's Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petitions. The parties filed briefs in support of and in opposition to the motion.

On June 7, 2016, the Court entered an Order granting the Company's Motion to Dismiss the Involuntary Petitions. In its accompanying Opinion, the Court found, in part, that based on the totality of the circumstances, the Creditors' primary concern in filing the involuntary petition was to effect a change in management to benefit their investments as stockholders, which was not a proper purpose for filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition. On June 30, 2016, the Company filed a Motion for an Award of Fees and Expenses and Punitive Damages.  On August 11, 2016, the Petitioning Creditors filed an Opposition to the Company's Motion for an Award of Fees and Expenses and Punitive Damages. On August 31, 2016, the Court entered an Order awarding judgment to the Company for attorneys' fees and expenses against the Petitioners, jointly and severally, in the amount of $54,886. On September 1, 2016, the Court filed an Amended Order in which it further stated that the amounts awarded were not subject to any setoff against amounts owed by the Company to the Petitioners. The Petitioners have failed, to date, to pay the Company any amounts due pursuant to this Amended Order.
