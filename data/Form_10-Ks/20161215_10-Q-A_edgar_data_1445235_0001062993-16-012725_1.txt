Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc.    Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements    (Unaudited)    
  NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
  
 Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc. (the  Company ,  HCT ) was
incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2010. The Company manufactures
and sells under license, alternative non-toxic (isocyanate-free) polyurethane,
Green Polyurethane , including coatings and raw binder ingredients (Green
Polyurethane  Monolithic Floor Coating and Green Polyurethane  Binder).  
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes of
Hybrid Coating Technologies Inc., included in Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016
and Form 10-K/A filed on May 2, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, are unaudited, but have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 
  Going Concern   
 The Company remains highly dependent upon funding from
non-operational sources and related parties. The Company s consolidated
financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has recurring negative
cash flows from operations, an accumulated deficit of $32,396,077, and has a
working capital deficit of $10,099,271 as of September 30, 2016. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  
 There are no assurances that the Company will be able to either
(1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement,
public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support The Company s
working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations
and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are
insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No
assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if
available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working
capital is not available the Company may be required to curtail or cease its
operations.  
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   Basis of Presentation       The financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented
in US dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. 
   Principles of Consolidation       The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Nanotech. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  
   Use of Estimates       The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 
   Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company
maintains various cash balances in two financial institutions located in Daly
City, California. These balances are fully insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which insures up to $250,000. On occasion, balances may
temporarily exceed such coverage. The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments, which could include commercial paper and certificates of deposits,
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments with maturities greater than three months and less than on year are
classified as short term investments. 
   Concentrations of Credit Risk       Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk include cash deposits place with financial institutions. The Company had
sales to one customer that comprised 100% of the Company s total revenues for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company believes that, in
the event its primary customers are unable or unwilling to continue to
purchase the Company s goods, there are a number of alternative customers at
comparable prices.

Intangible Assets       Intangible assets are
comprised of intellectual property which is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the assets  respective life, for approximately 5 years. Intellectual
property with a perpetual life in not amortized. 
   Impairment of Long - Lived Assets     
 Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment on an
annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. The determination of
recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or its disposition.
Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects
to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable
value. 
   Revenue Recognition       Revenue is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, goods are
delivered, sales price is determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. 
   Fair Value       ASC 820 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about
fair value measurements. It defines fair value as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also
establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value:  
 Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; and model-driven
valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are
observable. Valuations may be obtained from, or corroborated by, third-party
pricing services.  
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs to measure fair value of assets
and liabilities for which there is little, if any market activity at the
measurement date, using reasonable inputs and assumptions based upon the best
information at the time, to the extent that inputs are available without undue
cost and effort.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the significant inputs to
the Company s derivative liability calculation were Level 3 inputs. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in
the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 in the
fair value hierarchy:  

Stock-Based Compensation       For stock and
stock options awarded in return for services rendered, the expense is measured
at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense
on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is the vesting period.
The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense
based upon the number of awards expected to vest. 
 8 

Earnings Per Share       Basic net loss per
share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding over the reporting period. In periods in
which the Company reports a net loss, dilutive securities are excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share amounts as the effect would be
anti-dilutive.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
following convertible debt and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of
such shares would be anti-dilutive:  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements     
 The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of
operations, financial position or cash flow. 
   Subsequent Events       The Company has
evaluated all transactions occurring from September 30, 2016 through the date of
issuance of the consolidated financial statements for disclosure consideration.
 
  NOTE 3   INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
 On February 12, 2016, the Company signed the eleventh amendment
to its Licensing Agreement with Nanotech Industries, Inc. ( NTI ), whereby the

iii)  
     
       Issue purchase warrants to purchase 630,000 shares of

      the execution of this Agreement ( 12-Month Deadline ). The 12-Month
      Warrants shall be exercisable at any time from the date of issuance at a
      price per share equal to the par value of the Series B Preferred Stock and
      shall expire ten years from the date of issuance.   

(The  90-Day Warrants  and the 12-Month Warrants 
      collectively referred to as the  Warrants ).   

iv)  
     
       Pay the Licensor an amount equal to US $1,500,000, to be
      paid within twelve months of the execution of this Eleventh Amendment
      Agreement and recorded on the balance sheet as note payable - related
      party as of March 31, 2016 ( Fee Deadline ).    
 Should the Company not meet any of: (i) the Share Issuance
Deadline; or (ii) the 90-Day Deadline; or (iii) the 12-Month Deadline; or (iv)

Unmet Deadline not be extended by the Parties, the Company shall continue to
have the right to the Manufacturing and Sale for the Territory, on a
non-exclusive basis for the duration of the Agreement. The Company valued the
Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants at $502,104 along with a note payable of
$1,500,000. Both the 90-Day Warrants and 12-Month Warrants have been issued.

 The following is a summary of the licenses acquired to date
from NTI: 

NOTE 4   LOANS PAYABLE  
 Loans payable include a loan from a non-related party that was
issued for $75,000 on November 16, 2010 and was repayable on May 16, 2011 with a

currently in default. The creditors have not called these loans. 
 In 2013, the Company entered into various loan agreements
totaling $268,500, at interest rates ranging from 15%-16%. These loans are all
currently in default. The creditors have not called these loans. 
 Other than loans from related parties, there were no new loans
advanced in the first nine months of 2016. During the first nine months of 2015 lenders advanced $229,000 in non-interest bearing
demand loans.

related to these notes was $129,478 and $122,245, respectively, and the interest
paid was $20,250 and $19,150, respectively. 

NOTE 5   LOANS PAYABLE   SHAREHOLDERS    
 
During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company entered into various loan agreements and arrangements for loans with certain shareholders. The loans all have different maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2015 and interest rates
that range from 2% to 18%. The Company was in default on loans totalling  982,675 as of September 30, 2016. The shareholders have not called these loans.  
 
During the first nine months of 2016, the Company received a total of  1,924,433 in shareholder advances and repaid a total of  960,134. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company received a total of  1,778,106 in shareholder

payable. The fair value of the shares was  1,402,296 based on the market price on the date of grant which settled loans of  270,893. Accordingly, the Company recognized a loss on settlement in the amount of  1,131,503. The fair value of
the warrants was  3,380,000 based on the Black-Scholes method described in Note 10 which settled accounts payable and accrued liabilities to related parties of  531,000. Accordingly, the Company recognized a loss on settlement in the amount
of  2,849,000. In August 2016, the Company and shareholder-creditor agreed to cancel the 8,100,000 warrants issued previously, reinstate the loan of  531,000 and reverse the loss on settlement of  2,849,000. An additional 1,500,000
warrants were cancelled, accounts payable and accrued liabilities related parties of  90,000 were reinstated and a loss on settlement of payables of  380,000 was reversed.

  NOTE 6   CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES   
 On April 29, 2011, the Company issued convertible debentures
for proceeds of $1,201,000 (the  April 29  debenture) and on February 21, 2012,
issued an additional $119,500 (the  Feb 21  debenture and together the
 Debentures ) with a maturity of 36 months and a coupon rate of 10% per annum
payable in cash or capital stock at the Company s discretion. The debentures are
held by third parties and by non-controlling shareholders, and are convertible
as follows:  
  April 29, 2011 convertible debentures   
 -by dividing the conversion amount by a conversion factor of
1.4 yielding Units of the Company where each Unit (at a price of $1.40 per
Unit), is comprised of 1 share of common stock and one half of a warrant to
purchase a share of common stock of the Company with an exercise price of $2.00
per share and a maturity at April 29, 2014. Warrants are exercisable at the
option of the holder at any time prior to maturity. 
  February 21, 2012 convertible debentures:   
 -by dividing the conversion amount by a conversion factor of
1.45 yielding Units of the Company where each Unit (at a price of $1.45 per
Unit), is comprised of 1 share of common stock and one half of a warrant to
purchase a share of common stock of the Company with an exercise price of $2.10
per share and a maturity at February 21, 2015. Warrants are exercisable at the
option of the holder at any time prior to maturity. 
 11 

Both debentures carry an anti-dilution provision. The
conversion price applicable to the debentures is subject to reset in the event
of a Dilutive Issuance (as defined in the debenture agreement) by the Company. A
Dilutive Issuance excludes shares or options issued to employees, officers,
directors or consultants pursuant to stock option plans approved by the Board of
Directors. 
 The Company recorded a corresponding discount of $46,721 and
$558,248 against the carrying value of the convertible debentures during the
years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The discounts were
amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the debt.  
 On November 20, 2013, the Company entered in an amendment
agreement modifying its terms with both the April 29 and February 21 debenture
holders as follows: 
 1) The maturity date of the Debentures, was extended by a
period of 24 (twenty-four) months, to April 29, 2016 and February 21, 2017,
respectively; and  
 2) Each Unit into which the Debentures are convertible shall be
comprised of 2 stock purchase warrants at an exercise price per share equal to
the conversion price. The warrants shall expire 36 (thirty-six months) from the
date of issuance.  
 The maturity date for the April 29, 2011 debentures was April
29, 2016. The Company has defaulted on this payment but is in negotiations with
all the debenture holders to exchange their debt for new financing of which the
terms have not yet been determined. No notice by the debenture holders has been
sent to the Company. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
interest expense related to these convertible debentures was $33,284. Interest
expense of $99,128 and $98,766 have been recorded on the convertible debentures
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No interest
payments were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The balance
of the debentures at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $1,344,566
and $1,344,242, respectively.  
  NOTE 7   CONVERTIBLE NOTES  
 Convertible debt with a variable conversion feature consists of
the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
fully repaid the noteholders a total of $136,056 including principal and accrued
interest of $48,856. The Company fully amortized the remaining discount of
$76,975 with a corresponding charge to interest expense. In addition, the Company issued $427,500 in
convertible notes, net of issuance costs of $57,000, recorded as a debt
discount. The Company determined that the conversion option was a derivative.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $420,980 of which
$390,957 was recorded as debt discount, $99,323 as additional interest expense
and the Company amortized $105,206 of debt discount as interest expense and
recorded accrued interest of $6,284. 
 12 

The Company issued an additional $350,200 in convertible notes
which was a an assumption of promissory notes and loans owing to
shareholder-creditors and thereby a reduction in loans payable shareholders for
the same amount. Accordingly the Company recorded a derivative liability of
$380,107 of which $346,160 was recorded as debt discount, $33,947 as additional
interest expense and the Company amortized $12,531 of debt discount as interest
expense and recorded accrued interest of $1,355. The Company issued to
creditors, 24,416,448 shares for converted notes of $202,305, fees of $3,000 and
interest of $1,965. This resulted in a corresponding reduction in the debt
discount of $194,475 that was expensed as interest expense. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
repaid a noteholder $189,872 including interest of $13,333 and amortized the
remaining $60,424 discount to interest expense. In addition, the Company issued
$389,250 in convertible notes, net of issuance costs of $57,608, recorded as a
debt discount. The Company determined that the conversion option was a
derivative. Accordingly, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $751,776
of which $388,025 was recorded as debt discount, $366,251 as additional interest
expense and the Company amortized $77,116 of debt discount as interest expense
and recorded accrued interest of $1,761.  
 The Company issued an additional $32,000 in convertible notes
which was an assumption of promissory notes owing to shareholder-creditors and
thereby a reduction in loans payable shareholders for the same amount and a loss
on settlement of debt of $36,103. Accordingly the Company recorded a derivative
liability of $36,103 of which $32,000 was recorded as debt discount, $4,103 as
additional interest expense and the Company amortized the full $32,000 of debt
discount as interest expense as the lender converted all $32,000 of debt in
exchange for 134,102 shares of the Company s common stock. 
 Following is a summary of the debt discount for each of the
convertible notes:

NOTE 8   SENIOR SECURED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES   
 On August 16, 2010, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement with a third party for the subscription of senior secured
convertible debentures ( SSCD ) for an amount of $400,000. The debentures had a
maturity date of August 16, 2012 with a coupon of 10% and convert at the option
of the holder into shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.75 per
share. The notes are secured by all assets of the Company. The subscriber also
received 533,336 Series A warrants with a maturity of 1 year and an exercise
price of $1.25 and 133,360 Series B warrants with a term of 3 years and an
exercise price of $1.50. These warrants have since expired. To date, the shares
have not been registered. All prices and warrants issued have been adjusted for
the post-acquisition of Nanotech by HCT. 
 The Company is in default of payment of the debentures which
matured on August 16, 2012. No notices have been issued by the debenture
holder. 
 The obligations of the Company under the SSCD will rank senior
to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company and shall be secured
by a first priority, perfected security interest in all the assets of the
Company. 
 The balance outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 was $200,000.  
  NOTE 9   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   
 The embedded conversion features in the convertible debentures
and attached warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities. The warrants
contain full ratchet reset features (subject to adjustment for dilutive share
issuances) and should be valued as derivative liabilities.    
 The valuation of the derivative liability attached to the
Debentures arrived at through the use of multinomial lattice models based on a
probability weighted discounted cash flow model. These models are based on
future projections of the various potential outcomes. The features in the note
that were analyzed and incorporated into the model included the conversion
feature with the reset provisions and the call/redemption options. Based on
these features, there are six primary events that can occur: payments are made
in cash; payments are made with stock; the holder converts upon receiving a
change notice; the holder converts the note; the Issuer redeems the note; or the
company defaults on the note.  
 The model analyzed the underlying economic factors that
influenced which of these events would occur, when they were likely to occur,
and the specific terms that would be in effect at the time (i.e. interest rates,
stock price, conversion price, etc.). Projections were then made on these
underlying factors which led to a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities were
assigned to each of these scenarios over the remaining term of the note based on
management projections. This led to a cash flow projection over the life of the
note and a probability associated with that cash flow. A discounted weighted
average cash flow over the various scenarios was completed, and it was compared
to the discounted cash flow of the note without the embedded features, thus
determining a value for the derivative liability. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company recorded derivative liabilities for issuance of
convertible notes payable initial fair value of $854,547 and $1,014,703,
respectively. 
 The Company recorded unrealized gains of $105,245 and $315,465
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company
recorded an unrealized gain of $117,368 and an unrealized loss of $161,963 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value
of the derivative liability was $533,733 and $138,957 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  Compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
  
 Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented
below, including tabular amounts, is expressed in US dollars and prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
( GAAP ).  
  Use of Estimates   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Critical items of the
financial statements that require the use of estimates include the determination
of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the determination of the allowance for
inventory obsolescence, the determination of the useful life of fixed and
intangible assets for amortization calculation purposes, the assumptions for
fixed asset impairment tests, the determination of the allowance for guarantees,
the determination of the allowance for income taxes, the assumptions used for
the purposes of calculating the stock-based compensation expense, the
determination of the fair value of financial instruments, the determination of
the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired on business acquisitions
and the implicit fair value of goodwill. 
 The financial statements include estimates based on currently
available information and management s judgment as to the outcome of future
conditions and circumstances. 
 Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could
result in material changes to the estimates used in the preparation of the
financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and
assumptions. 
  Changes in Accounting Principles   
 No accounting changes were adopted during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.

Overview    Company Background   
 HCTs principal office is located in Daly City, California,
U.S.A. 
 As of September 30, 2016, HCT had 3 employees. 
 HCT offers an alternative to toxic formulations of polyurethane
(PU) worldwide through its exclusive distribution rights which provide for a
cost-effective alternative non-toxic (isocyanate-free) polyurethane, Green
Polyurethane . Its focus is within the C.A.S.E. segment specifically for large
industrial and commercial coatings applications where Green Polyurethane  has a
natural competitive advantage over other PU and epoxy coatings due to its
superior chemical resistance and environmentally safe properties with reduced
health risks. 
 The Company s ultimate goal is to license its proprietary Green
Polyurethane  formulation to national and/or global coatings formulators and
then focus on rolling out the commercialization of other Green Polyurethane 
applications such as adhesives and sealants. In order to achieve this, the
Company is proving the validity of its products through direct sales and is
therefore targeting large distributors and multiple client bases. The Company
intends to focus within the C.A.S.E. segment specifically for large industrial
and commercial coatings applications where Green Polyurethane  has a natural
competitive advantage over other polyurethane ( PU ) and epoxy coatings due to
its superior chemical resistance and environmentally safe properties with
reduced health risks. Some of the target applications for Green Polyurethane 
products markets include: 
 
   Industrial and commercial buildings
   Civil applications for tunnels and bridges
   Private and public garages
   Chemical and food processing plants
   Warehouses
   Monolithic floorings for civil, industrial and military engineering
   Marine and Aeronautic applications
   Industrial equipment for dairy and liquid fertilizer processing plants and
  delivery systems
   Military facilities and equipment
   Protective coatings inside industrial and commercial pipes   
 The Company s business growth model includes a two-pronged
strategy of direct sales and licensing. HCT s ultimate goal is to license our
proprietary formulation to national or global coatings formulators. In order to
achieve this it is proving the validity of its products through direct
sales. 
 In addition, the Company plans to: 
 
   Increase the number of contractors and applicators contacted
   Contact paint formulators and offer Green Polyurethane  Binder for their
  proprietary formulations
   Establish distribution channels utilizing existing distribution hubs
   Sub-license technology in certain geographic areas.   
 HCT intends to establish full commercial-scale manufacturing
for both of its products at Adhpro Adhesives in Magog, Quebec and Simpson
Coatings in California through non-exclusive toll manufacturing agreements. 
 HCT s strategy is to avoid large capital investments in
manufacturing and to outsource the manufacturing of the EPOD Products to
third-party manufacturers. At current capacity, the Company can outsource the
manufacture of up to 20,000 tons per year. 
 HCT is currently at the commencement of the commercialization
phase of its business model. HCT plans on significantly expanding its sales and
client base by promoting the NTI Products at trade unions, press and trade shows
and by capitalizing on existing distribution hubs to increase its distribution
channels and build new strategic relationships. The Company expects to have
significant sales by the third quarter of 2017.

Results of Operations   
  Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015   
 The Company recorded $167,614 in revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and $5,815 for the corresponding prior year s period
as the Company started to commercialize its products. 
 General and administrative expenses totaled $841,040 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,270,721 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, representing a 34% decrease from the prior
corresponding period. Included in general administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30 are the following:  
 
 Professional fees were $518,048 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $678,441 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of approximately $160,000. Professional fees decreased due to
approximately $297,000 less in charges from a consultant used for financing,
sales and marketing purposes. This was offset by an increase of $137,000 in
legal fees, accounting fees and fees paid to other consultants for sales and
financing purposes. 
 Payroll was $33,675 and $50,030 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was one employee on the
payroll. The other two employees were paid through stock-based compensation and
professional fees. $20,500 was paid to an employee for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and charged to professional fees. There was $0 charged to
professional fees for the corresponding prior year s period.  
 Stock-based compensation was $59,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $211,374 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Stock-based compensation decreased from the prior year s period due to
fewer consultants being compensated in this manner in 2016. 
 Rent, supplies and general office costs were $109,750 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was a $7,545 decrease from $117,295
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to lower office costs.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, travel and
tradeshows expenses were $120,567, decreasing by $93,014 from $213,581 for the
corresponding prior year s quarter. The Company had decreased travel in
connection with sales, product development and financing purposes during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to less activity as compared to the
prior period. 
 The Company expects to significantly increase operating
expenses in the future including selling general and administrative expenses as
the Company commences its efforts to commercialize its products. 
 The Company had $541,738 of amortization expense related to its
intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$796,704 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in
amortization expense was a result of the five-year extension of the exclusivity
period of the Company s licenses with NTI completed in the first quarter of
2016, therefore decreasing the amount amortized during the current period.  
 The Company recognized a gain on change in fair value of
derivatives of $105,245 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to a gain of $315,465 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
intrinsic fair value of the Company s convertible notes decreased during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due to the exercise
price of the embedded conversion feature decreasing as a result of the discount
rate applied to the 25-day average trading price of the Company s stock as
measured at September 30, 2016 compared to the exercise price on the dates of
issuance of the convertible notes. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded a decrease in the derivative liabilities and a corresponding
gain on change in fair value. 
 20 

The Company recorded $1,087,158 in interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,401,902 in interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest expense
was a result of the Company converting and redemption by the debt holders in the
latter part of 2015 and first nine months of 2016.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1,131,503 compared
to $355,641 recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was as a result of shares issued to pay a loan payable shareholder for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on settlement of payables in the
amount of $390,000, compared to a loss of $781,918 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The gain was a reversal of the loss recorded for warrants
issued to pay accounts payable  related parties in 2015 because the warrants
were cancelled in 2016 and the debt was reinstated. The loss in 2015 occurred as
a result of shares issued as payment to a shareholder-creditor for accounts
payable - related parties.  
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 with
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 The Company recorded $0 in revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and $1,712 for the corresponding prior year s period. The
Company is not at the commercial stage yet where it has regular repeating orders
from customers.

three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $283,099 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, representing a 23% increase from the prior
corresponding period. Included in general administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30 are the following:  
 
 Professional fees were $196,366 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, a 94% increase compared to $101,280 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 as a result of approximately $95,000 more in charges
from a professionals used for financing, sales and marketing purposes.  
 Payroll was $11,066 and $27,128 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was one employee charged to
this account in both 2016 to 2015. The decrease from 2015 was a result of
expenses charged to this account and later reversed in 2015. 
 Stock-based compensation was $59,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $34,542 for the three months ended September 30,
2015 an increase of approximately 25,000 due to a higher compensation
arrangement in 2016. 
 Rent, supplies and general office costs were $36,529 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 44% from the $65,558 for
the corresponding prior year s period due to higher office and corporate filing
expenses in 2015. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, travel and
tradeshows were $45,032 decreasing from $54,591 for the corresponding prior
year s period. There was a strong effort to promote the product and raise
financing in 2015.  
 The Company had $158,440 of amortization expense related to its
intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$265,611 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in
amortization expense was a result of the five-year extension of the exclusivity
period of the Company s licenses with NTI completed in the first quarter of
2016, therefore decreasing the amount amortized during the current period.  
 The Company recognized a gain on change in fair value of
derivatives of $117,368 during the three months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to a loss of $161,693 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
intrinsic fair value of the Company s convertible notes decreased during the
three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due to the exercise
price of the embedded conversion feature decreasing as a result of the discount
rate applied to the 25-day average trading price of the Company s stock as measured at September 30, 2016 compared to the
exercise price on the dates of issuance of the convertible notes. Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a decrease in the derivative
liabilities and a corresponding gain on change in fair value. The opposite
occurred in the prior year s period which resulted in the loss. 
 21 

The Company recorded $608,469 in interest expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $316,013 in interest expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest expense was
a result of the Company converting and redemption by the debt holders in the
latter part of 2015 and first nine months of 2016.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $2,546,397 compared
to $0 recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on
settlement of payables in the amount of $390,000, compared to a loss of
$297,838 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gain was a
reversal of the loss recorded for warrants issued to pay accounts payable -
related parties and loans payable shareholders in 2015 because the warrants were
cancelled in 2016 and the debt was reinstated. The loss on settlement of
payables in 2015 occurred as a result of shares issued as payment to a
shareholder-creditor for accounts payable - related parties.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Company had cash and equivalents of $30,100 as of September
30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received
$1,924,433 proceeds from shareholder loans and repaid $960,134 for shareholder
loans. The Company also received $427,500 proceeds and redeemed $136,056 in
convertible notes and repaid $480,000 note payable - related party. The Company
intends to raise additional capital to fund ongoing operations, but has no
assurances of being able to do so. The Company expects it will need
approximately $600,000 in additional funding to continue operations for the next
12 months.  
 The ability of the Company to continue its operations is
dependent on the successful execution of management's plans, which include the
expectation of raising debt or equity based capital, with some additional
funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until
such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working
capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with
related parties to sustain the Company s existence.  
  Principal Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015   
 Operating activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, used cash flows of $764,536 compared to $617,221 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The Company s net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 of $3,041,717 was partly offset by $1,131,503 in loss on extinguishment
of debt, $541,738 of amortization of intangible asset and by non-cash interest
and amortization of debt discounts of $138,000 and $466,791, respectively. 
 Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, used cash flows of $5,000 related to the issuance of a loan receivable for
equipment.  
 Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 provided cash flows of $775,743 compared to $617,649 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities
was primarily as a result of higher proceeds from loans payable - shareholders
in 2016. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including
arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk
support and credit risk support or other benefits. 
 22 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK      
  Convertible Debt   
 The fair market value of our 10% senior secured convertible
debentures is subject to interest rate risk, market price risk and other factors
due to the convertible feature of the debentures. The fair market value of the
debentures will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as
interest rates rise. In addition, the fair market value of the debentures will
generally increase as the market price of our common stock increases and
decrease as the market price falls. The interest and market value changes affect
the fair market value of the debentures but do not impact our financial
position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the
debt obligations. 
   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) which are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
President and Chief Executive Officer, who also acts as our principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who also acts
as our principal financial officer, an evaluation was performed on the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based
on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer, concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the
period covered by this quarterly report for the purpose of gathering, analyzing
and disclosing of information that the Company is required to disclose in the
reports it files under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. The Company has undertaken steps to remedy this and
improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, dependent
on cash resources. 
   Changes in internal control over financial reporting
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
