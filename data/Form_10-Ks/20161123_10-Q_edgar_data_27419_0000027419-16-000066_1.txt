Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

1. Accounting Policies 
    
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statement disclosures in our   2015   Form 10-K. We use the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. All adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of quarterly operating results are reflected herein and are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Unless otherwise noted, amounts presented within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refer to our continuing operations. 
    
  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, quarterly revenues, expenses, earnings, and cash flows are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 

2. Revenues 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. 
  We must adopt the standard no later than the first quarter of 2018, which begins on February 4, 2018. We do not plan to early adopt the standard. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the standard. 
  While we are still evaluating the standard, including our adoption method, we do not expect the standard to materially affect our consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows. 

3. Discontinued Operations 
    
  As part of a March 2016 settlement between Target Canada Co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of Target (collectively, Canada Subsidiaries) and all of their former landlords, we agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the Target Canada Co. estate in exchange for a full release from our obligations under guarantees of certain leases of the Canada Subsidiaries. The settlement was contingent upon the Canada Subsidiaries' creditors' and the court's approval of a plan of compromise and arrangement to complete the controlled, orderly, and timely wind-down of the Canada Subsidiaries (Plan). During the second quarter of 2016, a Plan was approved. The net pretax financial impact of the settlement and Plan was materially consistent with amounts previously recorded in our financial statements. For the nine months ended October 29, 2016, net earnings from discontinued operations primarily reflect tax benefits from investment losses in Canada recognized upon court approval of the Plan. During the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, we received   $21 million   and   $182 million  , respectively, from the Target Canada Co. estate.  During the second quarter of 2016, we made cash contributions of   $27 million   to the Target Canada Co. estate.

4. Restructuring Initiatives 
    
  In 2015, we initiated a series of headquarters workforce reductions intended to increase organizational effectiveness and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives. As a result, we recorded   $21 million   and   $135 million   of severance and other benefits-related charges within selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG A) during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively. The vast majority of these expenses required cash expenditures and were not included in our segment results. An accrual for restructuring costs of   $14 million   was included in other current liabilities as of October 31, 2015.   No   balance remained as of October 29, 2016. 

5. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). 

(a)       See Note 9 for additional information on interest rate swaps. 

(a)     The carrying amounts of certain other current assets, accounts payable, and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
   (b)       The carrying amount and estimated fair value of debt exclude unamortized swap valuation adjustments and capital lease obligations. 

6. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt 
    
  We obtain short-term financing from time to time under our commercial paper program, a form of notes payable. For the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, the maximum amount outstanding was   $89 million   and the average daily amounts outstanding were   $3 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, at a weighted average annual interest rate of   0.43 percent  . At October 29, 2016,   $89 million   was outstanding.   No   balances were outstanding at any time during 2015. 
    
  In April 2016, we issued unsecured fixed rate debt of   $1 billion   at   2.5%   that matures in April 2026 and   $1 billion   at   3.625%   that matures in April 2046. During the first half of 2016, we used cash on hand and proceeds from these issuances to repurchase   $1,389 million   of debt before its maturity at a market value of   $1,800 million  . We recognized a loss on early retirement of approximately   $422 million  , which was recorded in net interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

7 

In October 2016, we obtained a committed   $2.5 billion   revolving credit facility that expires in October 2021. This new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a   $2.25 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2018.   No   balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during   2016   or   2015  . 

7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a decision to discontinue a business, indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable. We also review goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. During the third quarter 2015, we announced our decision to wind down certain noncore operations. As a result, we recorded a   $35 million   pretax impairment loss, which included approximately   $23 million   of intangible assets and   $12 million   of goodwill. These costs were included in SG A on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, but were not included in our segment results. 

8. Property and Equipment 
    
  We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances such as a decision to relocate or close a store, make significant software changes or discontinue projects indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable. We recognized impairment losses during each of the periods presented, primarily resulting from discontinued projects, store closures, and completed or planned land sales.  

(a)    Substantially all of the impairments are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   (b)    For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, represents long-lived asset impairments from our decision to wind down certain noncore operations. These costs were not included in our segment results. 

9. Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Our derivative instruments primarily consist of interest rate swaps, which we use to mitigate interest rate risk. As a result of our use of derivative instruments, we have counterparty credit exposure to large global financial institutions. We monitor this concentration of counterparty credit risk on an ongoing basis. See Note 5 for a description of the fair value measurement of our derivative instruments and their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
    
  As of   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling   $1,000 million   and   $1,250 million  , respectively, were designated fair value hedges.     No   ineffectiveness was recognized during the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016   or   October 31, 2015  .   
    
  As of   October 29, 2016  ,   one   interest rate swap with a notional amount of   $250 million   was not designated a fair value hedge because it was de-designated concurrent with the repurchase of debt during the first half of 2016. As of   October 31, 2015  ,   two   interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of   $500 million  , were not designated fair value hedges. These two interest rate swaps had largely offsetting terms and matured during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  The amount remaining on unamortized hedged debt valuation gains from terminated or de-designated interest rate swaps that will be amortized into earnings over the remaining lives of the underlying debt totaled   $6 million  ,   $15 million  , and   $20 million  , at   October 29, 2016  ,   January 30, 2016  , and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 

8 

Periodic payments, valuation adjustments, and amortization of gains or losses on our derivative contracts had the following effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations: 

10. Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases.   The new standard requires lessees to record assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. 
    
  We must adopt the standard no later than the first quarter of 2019, which begins on February 3, 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. 
    
  While we are still evaluating the standard, we plan to early adopt the standard during the second half of 2017.  Our ability to early adopt is contingent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party providers. While we continue to assess all potential impacts, we believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for retail-store and office-space real estate leases, which will be recorded as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet upon adoption. We do not believe the new standard will have a notable impact on our liquidity. The standard will have no impact on our debt-covenant compliance under our current agreements. 

11. Share Repurchase 
    
  In September 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new   $5 billion   share repurchase program.  We will begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current   $10 billion   program, under which we have repurchased   133.1 million   shares of common stock through   October 29, 2016   at an average price of   $70.52  , for a total investment of   $9.4 billion  , excluding the initial share delivery and   $350 million   prepayment under the accelerated shares repurchase agreement (ASR) described below. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into an ASR to repurchase   $250   to   $350 million   of our common stock under the existing   $10 billion   share repurchase program. Under the agreement, we prepaid   $350 million   and received an initial delivery of   3.4 million   shares, which were retired, resulting in a   $230 million   reduction to shareholders' investment. As of  October 29, 2016,   $20 million   was included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as an additional reduction to shareholders' investment because the minimum repurchase was   $250 million  . The remaining   $100 million   was included in other current assets. The ASR was not accounted for as a derivative instrument. 
    
  In November 2016, the ASR  settled. We received an additional   1.3 million   shares, which were retired, and   $36 million   for the remaining amount not settled in shares. In total, we repurchased   4.6 million   shares under the ASR for a total cash investment of   $314 million   (  $67.67   per share). 

Note: Accelerated share repurchase activity in 2016 is omitted because the transaction was not fully settled as of October 29, 2016. Also excludes shares withheld to settle employee statutory tax withholding related to the vesting of share-based awards. 
  
   9 

(a)       Includes   0.2 million   and   0.1 million   shares delivered upon the noncash settlement of prepaid contracts during the nine months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. These contracts had an original cash investment of   $12 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, and aggregate market value of   $13 million   and   $7 million  . These contracts are among the investment vehicles used to reduce our economic exposure related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Note 13 provides the details of our positions in prepaid forward contracts.  

12. Share-Based Compensation 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). As a result of adoption, we recognized   $18 million   of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments in our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended October 29, 2016. These items were historically recorded in additional paid-in capital. In addition, for each period presented, cash flows related to excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity along with other income tax cash flows. Cash paid on employees' behalf related to shares withheld for tax purposes is classified as a financing activity. Retrospective application of the cash flow presentation resulted in increases to both net cash provided by operations and net cash required for financing activities of   $79 million   for the nine months ended October 31, 2015. Compensation expense each period continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. 

13. Pension and Other Benefits 
    
  Pension Benefits 
    
  We provide pension plan benefits to certain eligible team members. 

Other Benefits 
    
  We offer unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plans to certain team members. We mitigate some of our risk of these plans through investing in vehicles, including company-owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock, that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns of these plans. These investment vehicles are general corporate assets and are marked to market with the related gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period they occur. 
    
  The total change in fair value for contracts indexed to our own common stock recognized in earnings was pretax loss of   $3 million   and   $2 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, and pretax (loss)/income of   $(2) million   and   $2 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we made   no   investments in prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock. Adjusting our position in these investment vehicles may involve repurchasing shares of Target common stock when settling the forward contracts as described in Note 11. The settlement dates of these instruments are regularly renegotiated with the counterparty. At   October 29, 2016  , January 30, 2016 and   October 31, 2015  , we held asset positions in prepaid forward contracts for   0.4 million   shares of our common stock, for a total cash investment of   $17 million  ,   $18 million   and   $18 million   (  $41.11   per share) and a contractual fair value of   $28 million  ,   $32 million   and   $34 million  , respectively.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Summary  
    
  Third   quarter   2016   includes the following notable items: 

GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were   $1.06  . 
                
    Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were   $1.04  . 
                
    Third quarter comparable sales decreased   (0.2)   percent, driven by a   (1.2)   percent decline in traffic and   1.0   percent increase in average transaction amount.  
                
    We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share repurchase. 
       
  Sales were   $16,441 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , a decrease of   $1,172 million   or   6.7   percent from the same period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the December 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses (Pharmacy Transaction), which generated   $1,112 million   of sales during the three months ended October 31, 2015. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was   $2,770 million   and   $3,035 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. The operating cash flow decrease is due to the payment of approximately $500 million of taxes during the first quarter of 2016, primarily related to the Pharmacy Transaction. 

Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 18. 
    
  We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. For the trailing twelve months ended   October 29, 2016  , ROIC was   16.3   percent, compared with   13.0   percent for the trailing twelve months ended   October 31, 2015  . Excluding the net gain on the Pharmacy Transaction, ROIC was   14.3   percent for the trailing twelve months ended   October 29, 2016  . A reconciliation of ROIC is provided on page 19.

Analysis of Results of Operations 
    
  Segment Results 

Note: We operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations, excluding net interest expense and certain other discretely managed items. Our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores, online, or through mobile devices. See Note 15 of our Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes. 
   (a)     Sales include   $1,112 million   and   $3,240 million   related to our former pharmacy and clinic businesses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively, and cost of sales include   $885 million   and   $2,572 million  , respectively. The December 2015 sale of these businesses to CVS had no notable impact on EBITDA or EBIT. 
   (b)     SG A includes   $168 million   and   $489 million   of net profit-sharing income under our credit card program agreement for the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, and   $166 million   and   $477 million   for the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Note: Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. 
   (a)     Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, EBITDA margin rates were   9.2   percent and   10.7   percent for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively, and EBIT margin rates were   5.8   percent and   7.3   percent, respectively. 

13 

Sales 
    
  Sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, from our stores and digital channels, and gift card breakage. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites. Digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our distribution centers or our stores.  

(a)     Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, stores and digital channels sales were   97.1   percent and   2.9   percent of total sales, respectively, for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015. 

(a)     Pharmacy represented six percent of total sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015. 
    
  Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channels by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions that we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. We removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  

Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.

The collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible. 
    
  We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of the incremental purchases on REDcards are also incremental sales for Target, with the remainder representing a shift in tender type. Guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a REDcard at Target. 

Note: Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, total REDcard penetration was   23.5   percent and   23.1   percent for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, respectively. Amounts may not foot due to rounding. 
    
  Gross Margin Rate  

For the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  , our gross margin rate was   30.2   percent and   30.8 percent  , respectively, compared with   29.4   percent and   30.2 percent   in the comparable period last year. The increase was primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction and faster sales growth in higher margin categories, such as Apparel and Accessories and Home Furnishings and D cor, than the chain average (mix), partially offset by increased shipping costs. Cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment. 

15 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Rate 

For the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  , our SG A expense rate was   20.3   percent and   20.0 percent  , respectively, compared to   20.7   percent and   20.2   percent in the comparable periods last year. For the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the benefit of the Pharmacy Transaction and technology-related cost savings, partially offset by other items. 

Store Data 

16 

(a)       In thousands; reflects total square feet, less office, distribution center, and vacant space. 

Other Performance Factors 
    
  Consolidated Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
    
  We recorded $(4) million of selling, general, and administrative expenses outside of the segment during the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , and $86 million and $212 million for the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively, because they are discretely managed. Additional information about these items is provided within the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures on page 18 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 (the Financial Statements). 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
    
  Net interest expense from continuing operations was   $142 million   and   $864 million   for the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $151 million   and   $455 million   for the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  . Net interest expense for the nine months ended   October 29, 2016   included a loss on early retirement of debt of   $422 million  . 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016   was   33.8   percent and   33.0 percent  , respectively, compared with   34.3   percent and   34.6 percent   for the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. For the three months ended October 29, 2016, the decrease was primarily due to a variety of factors, none of which was individually significant.  For the nine months ended October 29, 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of $18 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments after the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Refer to Note 12 of the Financial Statements for more information regarding ASU 2016-09. 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  See Note 3 of the Financial Statements for information regarding our Canada exit.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures 
    
  To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.  

Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding.  
   (a)     Refer to Note 4 of the Financial Statements. 
   (b)     Refer to Note 7 and Note 8 of the Financial Statements. 
   (c)     For the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, represents items related to the Pharmacy Transaction. For the   three and nine   months ended October 31, 2015, represents costs related to the 2013 data breach.  

18 

We have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations (ROIC), which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors.  We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.  

(a)     Represents the add-back to operating income to reflect the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as capital leases, using eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense and an estimated interest rate of six percent. 
   (b)     See the following Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases table for the adjustments to our GAAP total rent expense to obtain the hypothetical capitalization of operating leases and related operating lease interest.  
   (c)     Calculated using the effective tax rate for continuing operations, which was   31.5%   and   34.1%   for the trailing twelve months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . For the trailing twelve months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, includes tax effect of   $1,826 million   and   $1,686 million  , respectively, related to EBIT and   $23 million   and   $31 million  , respectively, related to operating lease interest. 
   (d)     Calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense.  
   (e)     Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the comparable prior period. 
   (f)     Excluding the net gain on the Pharmacy Transaction, ROIC was   14.3   percent for the trailing twelve months ended   October 29, 2016  . 
    
  Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is total rent expense. Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  

19 

Analysis of Financial Condition 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was   $1,231 million   at   October 29, 2016  , compared with   $1,977 million   for the same period in   2015  . Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place certain dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. 
    
  Capital Allocation 
    
  We follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we invest fully in profitable opportunities to grow our business and create sustainable long-term value; second, we maintain our quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, if we have excess cash after addressing the first two priorities, we repurchase shares when we have capacity within the limits of targeted investment-grade credit ratings. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was   $2,770 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared with   $3,035 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease is primarily due to the payment of approximately $500 million of taxes during the first quarter of 2016 related to the Pharmacy Transaction. In April 2016, we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured debt that matures in 2026 and $1.0 billion of unsecured debt that matures in 2046. Combined with our prior year-end cash position, these proceeds allowed us to repurchase $1,389 million of debt at a market value of $1,800 million, fund current debt maturities, pay approximately $500 million in taxes related to the Pharmacy Transaction, invest in the business, pay dividends, and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. 
    
  Share Repurchases 
    
  In September 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. We will begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current $10 billion program, which is expected by the end of 2016. Under our current $10 billion share repurchase program, we have repurchased 133.1 million shares of common stock through   October 29, 2016  , at an average price of $70.52, for a total investment of $9.4 billion, excluding the initial delivery of 3.4 million shares and $350 million prepayment under the accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) described in Note 11 of the Financial Statements. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016  , we repurchased 8.1 million and 38.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for a total investment of $564 million ($69.73 per share) and $2,807 million ($72.87 per share), respectively, not including the initial share delivery and $350 million prepayment under the ASR. During the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, we repurchased 12.1 million and 27.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively, for a total investment of $942 million ($77.87 per share) and $2,182 million ($79.84 per share), respectively.  
    
  Dividends 
    
  We paid dividends totaling   $345 million   (  $0.60   per share) and   $1,011 million   (  $1.72   per share) for the   three and nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, and   $352 million   (  $0.56   per share) and   $1,017 million   (  $1.60   per share) for the   three and nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  , a per share increase of   7.1   and   7.5   percent, respectively. We declared dividends totaling   $342 million   (  $0.60   per share) in   third   quarter   2016  , a per share increase of   7.1   percent over the   $348 million   ($0.56  per share) of declared dividends during the   third   quarter of   2015  . We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. 

20 

Short-term and Long-term Financing 
    
  Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of   October 29, 2016   our credit ratings were as follows: 
    
                     Credit Ratings 
    Moody s 
    Standard and Poor s 
    Fitch 
      Long-term debt 
    A2 
    A 
    A- 
      Commercial paper 
    P-1 
    A-1 
    F2 

If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.  
    
  We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2016, that expires in October 2021. This new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2018. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during   2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at   October 29, 2016  , no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control; and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade. 
    
  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  As of the date of this report, other than the new borrowings and payments discussed in Note 6 of the Financial Statements, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business since January 30, 2016 as reported in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 of the Financial Statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues and leases, respectively. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words  expect,   may,   could,   believe,   would,   might,   anticipates,  or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: Our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the expected benefits of restructuring initiatives, the funding of debt maturities, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact and our plans for adoption of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the effects of our use of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, the expected return on plan assets, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for, claims and litigation. 

21 

All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. The most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  , which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  There have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks from those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  No response is required under Item 103 of Regulation S-K, nor have there been any material developments for any previously reported legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  . 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  On January 11, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of our common stock and on June 9, 2015 expanded the program by an additional $5 billion for a total authorization of $10 billion. On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. We will begin repurchasing shares under this new authorization upon completion of the current $10 billion program. There is no stated expiration for the share repurchase programs. Under the current program, we have repurchased 133.1 million shares of common stock through   October 29, 2016  , at an average price of $70.52, for a total investment of $9.4 billion, excluding the September 2016 ASR because the transaction was not fully settled as of October 29, 2016. The table below presents information with respect to Target common stock purchases made during the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , by Target or any "affiliated purchaser" of Target, as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act. 

(a)     In November 2016, the contract was settled and we received an additional 1.3 million shares, which were retired, and $36 million for the remaining amount not settled in shares. The $36 million, in addition to the amount reflected in the table, is available under the program. We repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares under the ASR for total cash investment of $314 million, or an average per share price of $67.67. Refer to Note 11 of the Financial Statements for further details about our ASR contract.

SECTION 1      INTRODUCTION; DEFINITIONS 
  1.1    Name of Plan; History.    This Plan (formerly known as the  Target Corporation SMG Executive Officer Deferred Compensation Plan) is a non-qualified, unfunded plan established for the purpose of allowing a select group of management or highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of income.  This Plan was originally adopted effective as of January 1, 1997 and was amended at various times thereafter.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the supplemental pension plans maintained by the Company.  Each subsequent April, the Participant receives annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the supplemental pension plans.  Effective July 31, 2002, this program was extended to include all officers of the Company.  Effective April 30, 2002, Participants in this Plan who were members of the Company s Corporate Operating Committee received credits under this Plan equal to the present value of their benefit under the Company s ESBP.  Each subsequent April, Participants received annual credits equal to the change in value of his or her benefit under the ESBP.  Effective October 28, 2005, all officers who had not previously received ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits, received a one-time transfer of the present value of their benefit under the ESBP.  As of January 28, 2006, a one-time ESBP credit was made to certain executive committee members and no subsequent ESBP Benefit Transfer Credits were made to those receiving the one-time ESBP credit.  From time to time, certain participants in the Target Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan   Senior Management Group ( ODCP ) and the Company negotiated to transfer the economic value of their benefit under ODCP to this Plan.  Officers eligible to receive performance share awards granted in the fiscal years ending February 1, 2003 and January 31, 2004 had an opportunity to defer receipt of the value of the earned performance shares into this Plan at the end of the performance period.  The performance period for the shares granted in 2003 ended February 3, 2007.  The performance period for the shares granted in 2004 ended February 2, 2008.  Effective January 1, 2005 (and other effective dates as specifically provided), this Plan was operated in compliance with Code section 409A.  Effective January 29, 2006, members of the Company s executive committee ceased to be eligible to receive enhanced earnings on their account balances.  The Plan, which is intended to comply with Code section 409A, was amended and restated effective January 1, 2009.  The Plan was amended and restated to incorporate the Company s recoupment policy effective January 13, 2010.  The Plan was amended and restated to reflect Plan administration and amendment changes authorized by the Board on November 10, 2010, to modify the Change in Control definition, and to set forth special provisions that are applicable to certain Participants who transfer to Canada, effective as of June 8, 2011.  The Plan was amended and restated to reflect the replacement of the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative with the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative beginning June 6, 2012, effective as of June 5, 2012.  The Plan was amended and restated to revise the method for distributing the final SPP Transfer Credit following a Termination of Employment for amounts accruing on or after January 1, 2014, to clarify the differences between  executive officer  and  member of the executive committee,  and to clarify the timing of certain post-death payments, effective December 1, 2013.  The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2014 to freeze that portion of the annual SPP Transfer Credit that arises from a positive accrual under SPP III after February 3, 2013 solely from treating the Participant as five years older than his or her actual age for purposes of determining the amount of the annual SPP Benefit Transfer Credit.  The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2015 (i) to revise the participation rules for Participants who are transferred to Canada on a temporary basis, (ii) to modify the Restoration Match Credit determination to cover Participants who are entitled to differing qualified 401(k) plan matching contribution percentages, (iii) to change the phrase  member of the executive committee  to  executive Officer  each place the phrase appears, and (iv) to define the term executive Officer  
  
   1 

to mean a Section 16 officer or executive officer as defined under Federal securities laws. The Plan was amended and restated effective April 3, 2016, (i) to provide that the Restoration Match Credit will, under certain circumstances, be credited to a Participant s Account prior to the end of the Plan Year, effective for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, (ii) to delete Appendix B   Participants on Temporary Assignment to Canada because it has ceased to be applicable, (iii) to clarify the definition of executive Officer as being an  executive officer  under Item 401 of Regulation S-K, and (iv) to remove unnecessary language from the recoupment provisions.  The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2017, as provided in this Plan Statement (i) to add a five (5) year vesting requirement for the Restoration Match Credits for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2016, (ii) to change the Enhancement from a monthly credit to an annual credit with an end of the year employment requirement, and (iii) to take advantage of some additional regulatory flexibility with respect to payments following death.

              (iii)

  6.2.4    Small Benefit.    Subject to Section 6.3,     in the event that the vested Account balance of a Participant who has died or experienced a Termination of Employment under the Plan is less than the applicable dollar amount under Code section 402(g)(1)(B) for that Plan Year as of the date on which the Plan Administrator makes such determinations, the Plan Administrator (on behalf of the Company) reserves the right to have the Participant s entire Account paid in the form of a single lump sum payment, provided the Plan Administrator s  exercise of discretion (on behalf of the Company) complies with the requirements of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(v).

              (ii) 
    Each monthly installment payment will be determined by dividing: (A) the amount of the vested portion of the Account attributable to Appendix A, Section A-4.3 and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment adjustment that would have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits at the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative through  the most recent Valuation Date preceding the earlier of June 5, 2012 or date the installment is due, and after June 5, 2012, at the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative through the most recent Valuation Date preceding the date the installment is due, by (B) twenty-four (24), less the number of monthly installment payments that have previously been made from the Plan. 
              (c) 
    In all other cases - a single lump sum payment within 60 days following the Participant s Termination of Employment.

           (a) 
    Enhancement, Deferral and Restoration Match Credits. 
              (i) 
    Lump Sum Distribution.    If Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credits are due after the complete distribution of the Participant s vested Account balance, or subaccount balance to which such Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credit relate, then such subsequent credits will be made to the Account and paid to the Participant in a single lump sum cash payment within 60 days of being credited to the Account. 
              (ii) 
    Installment Distribution.    If Enhancement, Deferral or Restoration Match Credits are due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent credits will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable. 
              (b) 
    SPP or ESBP Benefit Transfer Credit.    The SPP Benefit Transfer Credit other than those pursuant to Appendix A, Section A-4.3 or ESBP Benefit Transfer Credit, as applicable, arising after a Participant s Termination of Employment pursuant to Sections 3.3.3(f) and 3.4.1(e) shall be distributed as follows:   
              (i) 
    For amounts accruing prior to January 1, 2014, in a single lump sum within 60 days following the Termination of Employment; and 
      
   24 

(A) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after the complete distribution of the Participant s vested Account balance, or subaccount balance to which such Credit relates, then such Credit will be made to the Account and paid to the Participant in a single lump sum payment within 60 days of being credited to the Account;  
              (B) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due after a related installment distribution occurs, then such subsequent Credit will be made to the Account and included in the Account balance to determine the amount of the remaining scheduled payments as applicable; and 
              (C) 
    If the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit is due prior to the commencement of payment to which such credit relates, distribution shall be made at the time and in the manner elected by the Participant or pursuant to the Plan s rule, all as provided in Section 6.2.2. 
       
  6.2.7    Vesting in Benefits After the Distribution Date.    No portion of a Participant s Account will be distributed prior to being vested.  Subject to Section 6.3, if Participant is scheduled to receive a distribution of a portion of his or her Account that is not vested, such unvested amount will not be paid until subsequently vested, at which time it will be paid out in accordance with the respective distribution election. 
  6.2.8    No Spousal Rights.    No spouse, former spouse, Beneficiary or other person shall have any right to participate in the Participant s designation of a form or time of payment. 
  6.3    Six-Month Suspension for Specified Employees.    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 6 to the contrary, if a Participant is a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment, then any distributions arising on account of the Participant s Termination of Employment (other than on account of death) that are due shall be suspended and not be made until (6) months have elapsed since such Participant s Termination of Employment (or, if earlier, upon the date of the Participant s death).  Any payments that were otherwise payable during the six-month suspension period referred to in the preceding sentence, will be paid within 60 days after the end of such six-month suspension period. 
  6.4    Distribution on Account of Death; Distribution Following Death.    Upon the death of a Participant prior to Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger, the Participant s Account balance will be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following the Participant s death, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant s death occurs.  Upon the death of a Participant following Termination of Employment or other distribution trigger, distribution will continue in the same form and at the same time it was scheduled to be paid to the Participant, subject to Section 6.3, but will be paid in a single lump sum to the estate of the Beneficiary as soon as practicable following the Beneficiary s death.  
  6.5    Distribution on Account of Unforeseeable Emergency. 
  6.5.1    When Available.    A Participant may receive a distribution from the vested portion of his or her Account (which shall be deemed to include the deferral that would have been made but for the cancellation under Section 6.5.3) if the Plan Administrator determines that such  
  
   25 

distribution is on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency and the conditions in Section 6.5.2 have been fulfilled.  To receive such a distribution, the Participant must request a distribution by filing an application with the Plan Administrator and furnish such supporting documentation as the Plan Administrator may require.  In the application, the Participant shall specify the basis for the distribution and the dollar amount to be distributed.  If such request is approved by the Plan Administrator, distribution shall be made in a lump sum payment within 60 days following the approval by the Plan Administrator of the completed application. 
  6.5.2    Limitations  .  The amount that may be distributed with respect to a Participant s Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy the emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), and/or cancellation of deferrals pursuant to Section 6.5.3, provided the determination of such limitation is consistent with the requirements of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(ii). 
  6.5.3    Cancellation of Deferral Elections.    As provided by Section 2.12, in the event of a distribution under Section 6.5.1 the Plan Administrator will cancel the Participant s deferral elections for the balance of the applicable Plan Year. 
  6.6    Designation of Beneficiaries  . 
  6.6.1    Right to Designate or Revoke. 
           (a) 
    Each Participant may designate one or more primary Beneficiaries or secondary Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant s vested Account in the event of such Participant s death.  If fewer than all designated primary or secondary Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the amount of such predeceased Beneficiary s portion shall be allocated to the remaining primary or secondary Beneficiaries, as the case may be. 
              (b) 
    The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any spouse, any person named as Beneficiary or any other person. 
              (c) 
    No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless completed and filed with the Plan Administrator in accordance with Plan Rules during the Participant s lifetime. 
     6.6.2    Failure of Designation.    If a Participant: 
           (a) 
    fails to designate a Beneficiary, 
              (b) 
    designates a Beneficiary and thereafter revokes such designation without naming another Beneficiary, or 
              (c) 
    designates one or more Beneficiaries and all such Beneficiaries so designated fail to survive the Participant, such Participant s vested Account, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries: 
     
   26 

Participant s surviving spouse 
  Representative of Participant s estate 
    
  6.6.3    Disclaimers by Beneficiaries  .  A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased Participant s vested Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the Plan Rules. 
  6.6.4    Special Rules.    Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant s Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply: 
           (a) 
    If there is not sufficient evidence that a person designated as a Beneficiary was living at the time of the death of the Participant, it shall be deemed that the Beneficiary was not living at the time of the death of the Participant. 
              (b) 
    The automatic Beneficiaries specified in Section 6.6.2 and the Beneficiaries designated by the Participant shall become fixed at the time of the Participant s death (subject to Section 6.6.3) so that, if a Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before the receipt of all payments due such Beneficiary hereunder, such remaining payments shall be payable to the representative of such Beneficiary s estate. 
              (c) 
    If the Participant designates as a Beneficiary the person who is the Participant s spouse on the date of the designation, either by name or by relationship, or both, the dissolution, annulment or other legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such person shall automatically revoke such designation.  The foregoing shall not prevent the Participant from designating a former spouse as a beneficiary on a form that is both executed by the Participant and received by the Plan Administrator (i) after the date of the legal termination of the marriage between the Participant and such former spouse and (ii) during the Participant s lifetime. 
              (d) 
    A finalized marriage (other than a common law marriage) of a Participant subsequent to the date of filing of a Beneficiary designation shall revoke such designation unless the Participant s new spouse had previously been designated as the Beneficiary. 
              (e) 
    Any designation of a nonspouse Beneficiary by name that is accompanied by a description of relationship to the Participant shall be given effect without regard to whether the relationship to the Participant exists either then or at the Participant s death. 
              (f) 
    Any designation of a Beneficiary only by statement of relationship to the Participant shall be effective only to designate the person or persons standing in such relationship to the Participant at the Participant s death. 
     6.7    Facility of Payment. 
  6.7.1    Legal Disability.    In case of the legal disability, including minority, of an individual entitled to receive any payment under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall be advised of the existence of such condition: 
  
   27 

(a) 
    to the duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual, or 
              (b) 
    to a person or institution entrusted with the care or maintenance of the incompetent or disable Participant or Beneficiary, provided such person or institution has satisfied the Plan Administrator that the payment will be used for the best interest and assist in the care of such individual, and provided further, that no prior claim for said payment has been made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such individual. 
     6.7.2    Discharge of Liability.    Any payment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.7 shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the Participating Employers under this Plan. 
  6.8    Tax Withholding.    The Participating Employer (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or other tax that the payer reasonably determines is required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan.  All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be reduced by the amount to be withheld. 
  6.9    Payments Upon Rehire.    If a Participant who is receiving installment payments or due a deferred lump sum payment under this Plan is rehired, the payments will continue in accordance with the prior distribution elections. 
  6.10    Application for Distribution.    A Participant may be required to make application to receive payment and to complete other forms and furnish other documentation required by the Plan Administrator.  Distribution shall not be made to any Beneficiary until such Beneficiary shall have filed an application for benefits in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator and such application shall have been approved by the Plan Administrator and the Plan Administrator has determined that the applicant is entitled to payment. 
  6.11    Acceleration of Distributions.    The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to accelerate the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A. 
  6.12    Delay of Distributions.    The Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may exercise discretion on behalf of the Company to delay the distribution of any payment under this Plan to the extent allowed under Code section 409A, including, but not limited to, as necessary to maximize the Company s tax deductions as allowed pursuant to Code section 162(m) or to avoid violation of federal securities or other applicable law. 
  
   28 

SECTION 7      SOURCE OF PAYMENTS; NATURE OF INTEREST 
  7.1    Source of Payments. 
  7.1.1    General Assets.    Each Participating Employer will pay, from its general assets, the distribution of the Participant s Account under Section 6, and all costs, charges and expenses relating thereto. 
  7.1.2    Trust.    Upon a Change-in-Control that causes the Plan to be terminated under Section 8.3.2, the trustee of the Trust will make distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries from the Trust in satisfaction of a Participating Employer s obligations to make distributions under this Plan in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Trust to the extent such payments are not otherwise made directly by the Participating Employer. 
  7.2    Unfunded Obligation.    The obligation of the Participating Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Participating Employers to make such payments.  Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims or interests in any specific property or assets of the Company or a Participating Employer, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company. 
  7.3    Establishment of Trust.    The Participating Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan except as provided in the Trust.  The Participating Employers may from time to time transfer to the Trust cash, or other marketable securities or other property acceptable to the trustee in accordance with the terms of the Trust.  If the Participating Employers have deposited funds in the Trust, such funds shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Participating Employer that deposited such funds. 
  7.4    Spendthrift Provision.    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4, no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the Participating Employers.  The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan.  No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution following judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person. 
  7.4.1    Right to Designate Beneficiary.    The power to designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of such Participant s death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power or right to be exercised by the Participant     so as thereby to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant s Account or any part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be disregarded by the Participating Employers. 
  7.4.2    Plan Administrator s Right to Exercise Discretion.    This Section 7.4 shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable powers and options granted to it under any applicable provision hereof. 
  
   29 

7.5    Compensation Recovery (Recoupment).    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant who becomes subject to the Company s recoupment policy as adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors and amended from time to time ( Recoupment Policy ) may have all or a portion of his or her benefit under this Plan forfeited and/or all or a portion of any distributions payable to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary recovered by the Company. 
  7.5.1      Any Deferral Credit and related Earnings Credits resulting from the deferral of Eligible Compensation that is subject to recovery under the Recoupment Policy may be forfeited and, in such event, a corresponding adjustment will be made to the Participant s Account balance. 
  7.5.2      If a Participant has commenced distributions and is subject to a claim for recovery under the Recoupment Policy, then the Company may, subject to any limitations under Code section 409A, retain all or any portion of the Participant s (or his or her Beneficiary s) taxable distribution, net of state, federal or foreign tax withholding, to satisfy such claim. 
  
   30 

SECTION 8      ADOPTION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

  8.2    Amendment. 
  8.2.1    General Rule.        The Company, by action of its Board of Directors, or by action of a person so authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to any limitations or conditions in such authorization, may at any time amend the Plan, in whole or in part, for any reason, including but not limited to tax, accounting or insurance changes, a result of which may be to terminate the Plan for future deferrals provided, however, that no amendment shall be effective to decrease the benefits, nature or timing thereof payable under the Plan to any Participant with respect to deferrals made (and benefits thereafter accruing) prior to the date of such amendment.  Written notice of any amendment shall be given each Participant then participating in the Plan.   
  8.2.2    Amendment to Benefit of Executive Officer.    Any amendment to the benefit of an executive Officer under this Plan, to the extent approval of such amendment by the Board would be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and its regulations or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, will require the approval of the Board. 
  8.2.3    No Oral Amendments.    No modification of the terms of this Plan Statement shall be effective unless it is in writing.  No oral representation concerning the interpretation or effect of this Plan Statement shall be effective to amend this Plan Statement. 
  8.3    Termination and Liquidation. 
  8.3.1    General Rule. 
           (a) 
    To the extent necessary or reasonable to comply with any changes in law, the Board may at any time terminate and liquidate this Plan, provided such termination and liquidation satisfies the requirements of Code section 409A. 
              (b) 
    To the extent that a Participant s benefit under the Plan will be immediately included in the income of the Participant, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A, the Board may terminate and liquidate this Plan,     in whole or in part, as it relates to the impacted Participant. 
     8.3.2    Plan Termination and Liquidation on Account of a Change-in-Control.    Upon a Change-in-Control, the Plan will terminate and payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated if and to the extent provided in this Section 8.3.2. 
           (a) 
    The Plan will be terminated effective as of the first date on which there has occurred both (i) a Change-in-Control under Section 1.2.8, and (ii) a funding of the Trust on account of such Change-in-Control (referred to herein as the  Plan termination effective date ) unless, prior to such Plan termination effective date, the Board affirmatively determines that the Plan will not be terminated as of such effective date. The Board will be deemed to have taken action to irrevocably  
     
   31 

terminate the Plan as of the Plan termination effective date by its failure to affirmatively determine that the Plan will not terminate as of such date. 
           (b) 
    The determination by the Board under paragraph (a) constitutes a determination that such termination will satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, including an agreement by the Company that it will take such additional action or refrain from taking such action as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements necessary to terminate and liquidate the Plan under paragraph (c) below. 
              (c) 
    In the event the Board does not affirmatively determine not to terminate the Plan as provided in paragraph (a), such termination shall be subject to either (i) or (ii), as follows: 
              (i) 
    If the Change-in-Control qualifies as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon a administratively practicable but not more than 90 days following the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) have been satisfied. 
              (ii) 
    If the Change-in-Control does not qualify as a  change in control event  for purposes of Code section 409A, payment of all amounts under the Plan will be accelerated and made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but not more than 60 days following the 12 month anniversary of the Plan termination effective date, provided the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C) have been satisfied.

APPENDIX A 
  SPP Benefit 
  A-1    Purpose and Application.    The purpose of this Appendix A to this Plan Statement is to establish the rules for determining the amount of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credit under this Plan. 
  A-2    Background. 
  A-2.1    Transfer Credits.      The Company has adopted and maintained several nonqualified supplemental pension plans to provide retirement income to a select group of highly compensated and key management employees in excess of the retirement income that can be provided under the Target Pension Plan on account of limitations imposed by the Code.  Effective April 30, 2002, the Company began converting the accrued supplemental pension benefits of certain participants to credits under this Plan as adjusted annually to reflect changes in such benefits. 
  A-2.2    Cash Balance Formula  .    Effective January 1, 2003, the Target Pension Plan was amended to add a cash balance pension plan formula (referred to as the  personal pension account ).  Depending on the date participation commences or an election was made, a Participant who has a benefit under the Target Pension Plan may have his or her accrued benefit under such plan based solely on the final average pay formula (the  traditional formula ), solely on the personal pension account, or a combination of the traditional formula (frozen as of December 31, 2002) and the personal pension account. 
  A-3    Definitions. 
  A-3.1    SPP I       SPP I  means the Target Corporation SPP I. 
  A-3.2    SPP II       SPP II  means the Target Corporation SPP II. 
  A-3.3    SPP III       SPP III  means the Target Corporation SPP III. 
  A-4    SPP Benefit.    Each Participant s SPP Benefit is equal to the sum of the benefits under Section A-4.1, Section A-4.2 and Section A-4.3. 
  A-4.1    Traditional Formula Benefit.    A Participant s SPP Benefit is the excess, if any, of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b): 
           (a) 
    The monthly pension benefit the Participant would be entitled to under the Target Pension Plan, based on the  traditional formula,  if such formula were applied 
              (i) 
    without regard to the maximum benefit limitation required by Code section 415; 
              (ii) 
    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 
              (iii) 
    as if the definition of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a plan year included compensation that would have been paid in the plan year in the absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of  
     
   40 

the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan; 
           (iv) 
    without regard to the alternative benefit formula of Sections 4.6(a)(3) and 4.6(b)(2) of the Target Pension  Plan. 
              (b) 
    The monthly pension benefit the Participant is entitled to receive under the Target Pension Plan on account of the  traditional formula.  
     A-4.2    Personal Pension Account.    A Participant s SPP Benefit includes the excess, if any, of the amount determined under (a) over the amount determined under (b): 
           (a) 
    The amount that would have been credited each quarter (including both  pay credits  and  interest credits ) to the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan, if such account were applied: 
              (i) 
    without regard to the maximum benefit limitations required by Code section 415; 
              (ii) 
    without regard to the maximum compensation limitation under Code section 401(a)(17); 
              (iii) 
    as if the definition of  certified earnings  under the Target Pension Plan for a calendar quarter included compensation that would have been paid during such calendar quarter in the absence of the Participant s election to defer payment of the compensation to a later date pursuant to the provisions of a deferred compensation plan; 
              (iv) 
    as if a distribution had been made from such account equal to any SPP Benefit Transfer Credits made under Section 3.3. 
              (b) 
    The amount of the credits actually made to the Participant s  personal pension account  under the Target Pension Plan. 
     A-4.3    SPP III.    For a Participant who was participating in SPP III, the Participant s SPP Benefit includes the actuarial equivalent lump sum present value of the monthly pension benefit under (a) over the monthly pension benefit under (b): 
           (a) 
    The monthly pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a) determined by treating the Participant as five (5) years older than his or her actual age solely for purposes of determining the early commencement factor (but in no case shall the Participant s age be deemed to be greater than age 65); provided, however, the early commencement factor shall be equal to the factor in effect under this Paragraph (a) on February 1, 2013, or, if greater, the Participant s actual early commencement factor under the Target Pension Plan. 
              (b) 
    The monthly pension benefits determined under Section A-4.1(a). 
     A-4.4    Company Determination.    The actuarial lump sum present value of a Participant s benefit determined under this Appendix A will be determined by the Company, in its  
  
   41 

sole and absolute discretion, by using such factors and assumptions as the Company considers appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion as of the date of distribution or transfer. 
  A-5    Forfeiture of SPP III Benefit. 
  A-5.1    Pre-Age 55 SPP III Forfeiture.        A Participant who has a Termination of Employment prior to attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3. 
  A-5.2    ICP Eligibility SPP III Forfeiture.    A Participant who becomes entitled to receive payments under an income continuation plan or policy of an Affiliate on account of his or her Termination of Employment after attaining age 55 will forfeit that portion of his or her SPP Benefit Transfer Credit and Earnings Credit determined under Section A-5.3. 
  A-5.3    Amount of SPP III Forfeiture.    A Participant s forfeiture under Sections A-5.1 or A-5.2 is that portion of the SPP Benefit Transfer Credits attributable to his or her SPP Benefit determined under Section A-4.3 of Appendix A, and an amount of Earnings Credits equal to the investment adjustment that would have been credited on such SPP Benefit Transfer Credits at the Stable Value Crediting Rate Alternative through June 5, 2012 and for periods after June 5, 2012, at the Intermediate-Term Bond Crediting Rate Alternative.

If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Euro-Dollar Loans in any Notice of Borrowing, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.   
  (b)      Euro-Dollar Loans  .  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Euro-Dollar Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan.  During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Euro-Dollar Loans without the consent of the Required Banks, and the Required Banks may demand that any or all of the outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans. 
  (c)      Notice of Interest Rates  .  The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Euro-Dollar Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks of any change in Bank of America s  prime rate  used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
  (d)      Interest Periods  .  After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect.  
  (e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Bank may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Agent and such Bank. 
  Section 2.03      Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans  .   
  (a)    Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank s share (if any) of such Borrowing, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the  
  
   13 

Agent shall notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion to Euro-Dollar Loans having an Interest Period of one (1) month described in   Section 2.02(a)  .  
  (b)    Not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in   subsection (c)   of this   Section 2.03  ) make available its share of such Borrowing, in immediately available funds, to the Agent at its address referred to in   Section 9.01  .  Unless the Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in   Article 3   has not been satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at the Agent s aforesaid address. 
  (c)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank s share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with   subsection (b)   of this   Section 2.03   and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate or the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to   Section 2.06   and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank s Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.  The failure of any Bank to make available its share of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its corresponding obligation to do so on the date when due, and no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to so make its share available. 
  Section 2.04      Reserved  .   
  Section 2.05      Repayment of Loans  .  The Borrower shall repay to the Banks on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding on such date, together with interest accrued thereon.  
    
  Section 2.06      Interest Rates  .   
  (a)    Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus the Base Rate for such day.  Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day. 
  
   14 

(b)    Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day   plus   the London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period.  Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.   
  The    London Interbank Offered Rate    means, for (a) for any Interest Period with respect to a Euro-Dollar Loan, the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (   LIBOR   ), or a comparable or successor rate which rate is approved by the Agent and is recognized by the market as a comparable or successor rate, as published on the applicable Bloomberg screen page (or such other commercially available source providing such quotations as may be designated by the Agent from time to time) (in such case, the    LIBOR Rate   ) at or about 11:00 a.m., London time, two (2) Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period, for Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of such Interest Period) with a term equivalent to such Interest Period and (b) for any interest calculation with respect to a Base Rate Loan, on any date, the rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate, at or about 11:00 a.m., London time, two (2) Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to such date for Dollar deposits with a term of one (1) month commencing that day;   provided that  :  (i) to the extent a comparable or successor rate is approved by the Agent in connection herewith, the approved rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, further that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Agent, such approved rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Agent and (ii) if the London Interbank Offered Rate shall be less than zero percent, such rate shall be deemed to be zero percent for purposes of this Agreement.  
    
  (c)    Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the date payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2%   plus   the higher of (i) the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the sum of the Applicable Margin for such day plus the London Interbank Offered Rate as of such day applicable to such Loan amount for a presumed one-month Interest Period (or if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business Days, then for a presumed six-month Interest Period), or, if the circumstances described in   clause (a)   or   (b)   of   Section 8.01   shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2%   plus   the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day. 
  (d)    The    Applicable Margin    with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan, or Base Rate Loan at any date is the applicable percentage amount set forth below in the applicable column, which shall be (i) determined based upon the Debt Rating as specified below and (ii) applicable to all Euro-Dollar Loans, and Base Rate Loans existing on and after the first date a specific Debt Rating is effective (the    Debt Rating Date   ) and continuing until, but not including, the immediate next Debt Rating Date: 
  
   15 

In the event that the Debt Ratings assigned by S P and Moody s differ, the Applicable Margin and the Facility Fee Rate referred to in   Section 2.07   shall be determined by reference to the rating level having the higher Debt Rating unless such ratings are more than one level apart, in which case the rating level that is one tier below the higher of the two ratings shall determine the Applicable Margin and the Facility Fee Rate.  The final Debt Rating level by which the Applicable Margin and the Facility Fee Rate are determined is referred to herein as a  Level . 
  In the event that either S P or Moody s (but not both) shall not make a Debt Rating, the above calculations of the Applicable Margin and the Facility Fee Rate shall be made based on (i) the rating provided by S P or Moody s, whichever shall then maintain a current Debt Rating, and (ii) the Debt Rating provided by a nationally recognized securities rating agency selected by the Borrower and approved by the Agent, which shall be substituted for either S P or Moody s, as the case may be (the    Alternative Rating Agency   ), and the Alternative Rating Agency s equivalent rating levels shall be substituted for the Debt Rating levels of either S P or Moody s, whichever shall no longer then make the applicable Debt Rating. 
  Section 2.07      Facility Fees  .   
  (a)    The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments a facility fee at the Facility Fee Rate (as defined below).  Such facility fee shall accrue from and including the date hereof to but excluding the Termination Date, on the daily aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether used or unused). 
  (b)       Facility Fee Rate    means, at any date, a rate per annum equal to (i) 0.050%, if Level I Status exists at such date, (ii) 0.060%, if Level II Status exists at such  
  
   16 

date, (iii) 0.070%, if Level III Status exists at such date, (iv) 0.090%, if Level IV Status exists at such date, and (v) 0.110% if Level V Status exists at such date. 
  (c)    Accrued fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and upon the respective Termination Date for each Bank (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety). 
  Section 2.08      Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments  .  The Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days  notice to the Agent, (a) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time, or (b) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans. 
  Section 2.09      Mandatory Termination of Commitments  .  The Commitments of each Bank shall terminate on its respective Termination Date, and any Loans then outstanding to such Bank (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date  . 
  Section 2.10      Optional Prepayments  .   
  (a)    The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent pursuant to delivery to the Agent of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to   Section 2.12  ;   provided   that, unless otherwise agreed by the Agent, (A) such notice must be received by the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) (1) three (3) Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Euro-Dollar Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (B) any prepayment of Loans shall be in a principal amount of $25,000,000 or a whole multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such Notice of Loan Prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Euro-Dollar Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  Any prepayment of principal of any Euro-Dollar Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to   Section 2.12  .  Subject to   Section 2.18  , each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Borrowing. 
  (b)    Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank s ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. 
  Section 2.11      General Provisions as to Payments  .   
  (a)    The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off, deduction, recoupment or counterclaim, to the Agent at its address referred to in   Section 9.01  .  The Agent will  
  
   17 

promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Agent for the account of the Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day unless such Domestic Business Day occurs after the Termination Date, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month or occurs after the Termination Date, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.   
  (b)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
  Section 2.12      Funding Losses  .  If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan (pursuant to   Sections 2.10,  2.15  ,   Article 6   or   8   or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow any Euro-Dollar Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with   Section 2.03(a)  , or if any Bank shall be required to assign to any other Bank any portion of a Loan pursuant to   Section 2.16(b)  , the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or failure to borrow,   provided   that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error  . 
  Section 2.13      Computation of Interest and Fees  .  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan from the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one (1) day.  Each determination by the  
  
   18 

Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  Section 2.14      Withholding Tax Exemption  .   
  At least five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Bank, (i) each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (including Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, if applicable), W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable), and such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and its Note, if applicable, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes or any United States federal withholding taxes under FATCA (defined below) and (ii) each Bank that is incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent executed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax.  Each Bank further undertakes to deliver to the Agent on behalf of the Borrower two additional copies of such form or other documentation (or a successor form or documentation) on or before the date that such form or documentation expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form or documentation so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and its Notes, if applicable, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income or backup withholding taxes or any United States federal withholding taxes under FATCA, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income or backup withholding tax or United States federal withholding taxes under FATCA.  For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the effective date of this Agreement, the Borrower and the Agent shall treat (and each Bank hereby authorizes the Agent to treat) the Loans as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).  
   Section 2.15      Change of Control; Offer of Prepayment  .  (a) If a Change of Control shall occur (i) the Borrower will, within ten days after the occurrence thereof, give each Bank notice thereof and shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and (ii) each Bank may, by three Domestic Business Days  notice to the Borrower and the Agent, given not later than 60 days after receipt of such notice of Change of Control, terminate its Commitment, which shall thereupon be terminated, and declare all of the outstanding Loans made by it (together with accrued interest thereon) and any other amounts payable hereunder for its account to be, and such Loans and such other amounts (including, without limitation, amounts payable under Section 2.12) shall thereupon become, immediately due and payable without  
  
   19 

presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.  For the purpose of this Section, a    Change of Control    shall occur if, during any period of 12 consecutive months,  (I) a majority of the directors of the Borrower shall be Persons other than Persons (A) who were directors of the Borrower on the first day of such period, (B) whose election or nomination as a director of the Borrower was approved by individuals referred to in clause (A) constituting at the time of such election or nomination at least a majority of the Board of Directors, or (C) whose election or nomination as a director of the Borrower was approved by individuals referred to in clauses (A) or (B) above or this clause (C) constituting at the time of such election or nomination at least a majority of the Board of Directors or (II) any person or group of persons (within the meaning of   Section 13   or   14   of the Exchange Act) shall have acquired beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act) of 50% or more in voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock. 
  (b)    If any event or condition shall occur under any agreement, indenture or instrument relating to any Material Debt (other than an event or condition arising due to the Borrower s exercise of an optional right to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease), which event or condition has the effect of requiring an offer of prepayment, redemption, purchase or defeasance to be made to the holders of such Material Debt (a    Prepayment Offer ),   (i) the Borrower will, within ten days after the first day that such event or condition occurs, give each Bank notice thereof and shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and (ii) each Bank may, by three Domestic Business Days  notice to the Borrower and the Agent, given not later than 60 days after receipt of such notice of Prepayment Offer, terminate its Commitment, which shall thereupon be terminated, and declare all of the outstanding Loans made by it (together with accrued interest thereon) and any other amounts payable hereunder for its account to be, and such Loans and such other amounts (including, without limitation, amounts payable under Section 2.12) shall thereupon become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.     
  Section 2.16      Increase in Combined Commitments  .   
  (a)    The Borrower shall have the right, without the consent of the Banks, subject to the terms of this   Section 2.16  , to effectuate from time to time, at any time prior to the then effective Termination Date, an increase in the combined Commitments under this Agreement by adding to this Agreement one or more other banks or other financial institutions reasonably acceptable to the Agent and the Borrower and qualifying as an Assignee hereunder, who shall, upon completion of the requirements of this   Section 2.16   constitute  Banks  hereunder (an    Added Bank   ), or by allowing one or more Banks in their sole discretion to increase their respective Commitments hereunder (each an    Increasing Bank   ), so that such added and increased Commitments shall equal the increase in Commitments effectuated pursuant to this   Section 2.16  ;   provided   that (i) there shall not be any increased Commitment or any added Commitment, unless the aggregate increase or addition to be effected is at least $25,000,000, (ii) no increase in or added Commitments pursuant to this   Section 2.16   shall result in combined Commitments exceeding $3,000,000,000, (iii) no Bank s Commitment shall be increased under this   Section 2.16   without the consent of such Bank, and (iv) there shall not exist any Default  
  
   20

The Borrower shall deliver or pay, as applicable, to the Agent not later than ten Domestic Business Days prior to any such increase in Commitments each of the following items with respect to each Added Bank and Increasing Bank: 
  (i)    a written notice of Borrower s intention to increase the combined Commitments pursuant to this   Section 2.16  , which shall specify each Added Bank and Increasing Bank, if any, the changes in amounts of Commitments that will result, and such other information as is reasonably requested by the Agent; 
  (ii)    documents in the form of   Exhibit B   or   Exhibit C  , as may be required by the Agent, executed and delivered by each Added Bank and each Increasing Bank, pursuant to which it becomes a party hereto or increases its Commitment, as the case may be; 
  (iii)    if requested by the applicable Bank, Notes or replacement Notes, as the case may be, executed and delivered by Borrower; and 
  (iv)    a non-refundable processing fee of $3,500 with respect to each Added Bank or Increasing Bank for the sole account of the Agent. 
  (b)    Upon receipt of any notice referred to in   clause (a)(i) above  , the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof.  Upon execution and delivery of such documents and the payment of such fee (the    Increased Commitment Date   ), each such Added Bank shall constitute a  Bank  for all purposes under this Agreement and related documents without any acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Banks, with a Commitment as specified in such documents, or such Bank s Commitment shall increase as specified in such documents, as the case may be.  Immediately upon the effectiveness of the addition of such Added Bank or the increase in the Commitment of such Increasing Bank under this   Section 2.16  , (i) the respective pro rata shares of the Banks shall be deemed modified as appropriate to correspond to such changed combined Commitments, and (ii) if there are at such time outstanding any Loans, each Bank whose pro rata share has been decreased as a result of the increase in the combined Commitments shall be deemed to have assigned, without recourse, to each Added Bank and Increasing Bank such portion of such Bank s Loans as shall be necessary to effectuate such adjustment in pro rata shares.  Each Increasing Bank and Added Bank (x) shall be deemed to have assumed such portion of such Loans and (y) shall fund to each other Bank on the Increased Commitment Date the amount of Loans assigned by it to such Bank.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Banks on demand any and all amounts to the extent payable pursuant to   Section 2.12   as a result of any such prepayment of Loans occasioned by the foregoing increase in Commitments and the reallocation of the pro rata shares. 
  (c)    This section shall supercede any provisions in   Section 9.06(b)   to the contrary. 
  
   21

  (b)      Bank Elections to Extend  .  Each Bank, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to the Agent given not later than 30 days following the Notice Date, advise the Agent whether or not such Bank agrees to such extension (each such Bank that determines not to so extend its Commitment being referred to as a    Non-Extending Bank   )).  Any Bank that does not so advise the Agent on or before the 30   th    day following the Notice Date (the    Response Deadline   ) shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Bank.  The election of any Bank to agree to such extension of the Termination Date shall not obligate any other Bank to so agree. 
  (c)      Notification by Agent  .  The Agent shall notify the Borrower of each Bank s determination under this   Section 2.17   no later than the 5   th    Domestic Business Day after the Response Deadline.

  (e)      Minimum Extension Requirement  .  If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Banks that have agreed to so extend the Termination Date (each, an    Extending Bank   ) and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Banks shall be more than 51% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the related Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the related Anniversary Date (but subject to the prior satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clause (f) below), the Termination Date of this Agreement and the Termination Date with respect to the Commitments of each Extending Bank and of each Additional Commitment Bank shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Existing Termination Date (except that, if such date is not a Domestic Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Domestic Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Bank shall thereupon become a  Bank  for all purposes of  
  
   22 

this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Commitment of each Non-Extending Bank shall remain in full force and effect until and shall terminate on the Existing Termination Date for such Non-Extending Bank, unless such Non-Extending Bank is replaced prior to the related Anniversary Date by an Additional Commitment Bank as provided in clause (d) above. 
  (f)      Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Termination Date pursuant to this Section shall not be effective with respect to any Bank unless: 
  (i)    no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto; 
  (ii)    the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement that are qualified by materiality are true and correct and the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Agreement that are not qualified by materiality are true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date);  
  (iii)    at the time of such extension no material adverse change has occurred since January 30, 2016 in the business, financial position or results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries considered as a whole; and

  (i)    a judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $150,000,000 (to the extent not covered by independent third-party insurance as to which the insurer does not dispute coverage), shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and (A) enforcement proceedings are commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order, or (B) there is a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, is not in effect;

  Section 6.02      Notice of Default  .  The Agent shall give notice to the Borrower under   Section 6.01(c)   promptly upon being requested to do so by any Bank and shall thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.

Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with its Commitment (determined at the time such indemnification is sought), indemnify the Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agent and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against all Indemnified Liabilities, as defined in   Section 9.03(b)   (except such as result from such indemnitees  gross negligence or willful misconduct;   provided  ,   however  , that no action taken in accordance with directions of the Required Banks or, in the case of an action expressly requiring the consent of all of the Banks, with the directions of all of the Banks, shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section), that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or as a result of any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share (determined at the time such reimbursement is sought) of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, including the allocated costs of internal legal services) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.

  Section 7.07      Credit Decision  .  Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Co-Documentation Agent, the Syndication Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall thereafter be discharged from its duties and

The Agent shall (subject to   Section 7.05   hereof) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required Banks, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks. 
  ARTICLE 8.      CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES 
  Section 8.01      Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair  .  If in connection with any request for a Euro-Dollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof,  (a)  the Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Euro-Dollar Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the London Interbank Offered Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Euro-Dollar Loan  or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (a) (i) above,    Impacted Loans   ), or (b) the Agent or the Required Banks determine that for any reason the London Interbank Offered Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Euro-Dollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Bank.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Euro-Dollar Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the London Interbank Offered Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the London Interbank Offered Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Agent upon the instruction of the Required Banks revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Euro-Dollar Loans (to the extent of the affected Euro-Dollar Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing  
  
   37 

that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agent has made the determination described in clause (a) (i) of this section, the Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Banks, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans  ,    in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Agent or the Required     Banks notify the Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Bank determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans the interest on which is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Bank to do any of the foregoing and provides the Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
  Section 8.02      Illegality  .  If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall, subject to   Section 2.01  , borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan. 
  Section 8.03      Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Reserves on Euro-Dollar Loans  .   
  (a)    If on or after the date hereof in the case of any Loan or any obligation to make Loans, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority: 
  
   38 

(i)    shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Note, if any, or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its Euro-Dollar Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect of its Euro-Dollar Loans or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Bank s principal executive office or Applicable Lending Office is located) and except for any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA; or 
  (ii)    shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System but excluding the reserve requirement contemplated by clause (e) below), special deposit, or insurance assessment or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on London interbank market any other condition affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Note, if any, or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan (or maintaining its obligation to many any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note, if any, with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction. 
  (b)    If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank s obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction. 
  (c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel  
  
   39 

Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law contemplated by the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) of this   Section 8.03  , regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. 
  (d)    Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. 
  (e)      Reserves on Euro-Dollar Loans  .  The Borrower shall pay to each Bank, as long as such Bank shall be required by a Governmental Authority to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as  Eurocurrency liabilities ), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Bank (as determined by such Bank in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,   provided   the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days  prior notice (with a copy to the Agent) of such additional interest from such Bank.  If a Bank fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice. 
  Section 8.04      Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans  .    If (a) the obligation of any Bank to make, maintain or convert to Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to   Section 8.02   or (b) any Bank has demanded compensation under   Section 8.03   and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days  prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist: 
  (a)    all Loans which would otherwise be made, maintained or converted by such Bank as Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be made, maintained or converted instead as Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and 
  (b)    after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans, has been repaid or converted, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

  Section 9.04      Sharing of Set-Off  .  Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off, recoupment, counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then due with respect to any Loans held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then due with respect to any Loans held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment (the    Benefited Bank   ) shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata;   provided  ,   however  , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such Benefited Bank or is repaid in whole or in part by such Benefited Bank in good faith settlement of a pending or threatened avoidance claim, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery or settlement payment, but without interest;   further     provided   that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness under this Agreement.

signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent);   provided   that no such amendment or waiver shall: (a) increase, decrease or extend the Commitment of any Bank (except for (i) a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks, (ii) any increase in Commitments made pursuant to, and in compliance with,   Sections 2.16   and   2.17  , as applicable, and (iii) any extension made pursuant to, and in compliance with,   Section 2.17  ) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, without the written consent of such Bank; (b) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any fees or margins hereunder (subject to the second proviso to this   Section 9.05  ), without the written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby (  provided  ,   however  , that only the consent of the Required Banks shall be necessary (i) to amend the rate payable as default interest hereunder or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at such default rate, or (ii) to amend   Section 5.07   or   5.08   (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or to reduce any fee payable hereunder); (c) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder or for the Termination Date (except pursuant to, and in compliance with   Section 2.17   hereof), without the written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby; (d) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement, without the written consent of each Bank; (e) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the written consent of each Bank; or (f) amend, modify or waive   Section 9.04   or this   Section 9.05   without the written consent of each Bank;   provided further  , however, that any fee letter relating hereto may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Bank shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Banks or each affected Bank may be effected with the consent of the applicable Banks other than Defaulting Banks), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Bank may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Bank and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Banks or each affected Bank that by its terms affects any Defaulting Bank disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Banks shall require the consent of such Defaulting Bank. 
  Section 9.06      Successors and Assigns  .   
  (a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank, and no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Assignee in accordance with the provisions of   subsection (c)   and   (d)   of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of   subsection (b)   of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of   subsection (e)   or   (g)   of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent  
  
   44 

provided in   subsection (b)   of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
  (b)    Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks, Approved Funds or other institutions (other than a Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Bank) (each a    Participant   ) participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in   clause (a)  ,   (b)   or   (c)   of   Section 9.05   without the consent of the Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of   Article 8   with respect to its participating interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by   subsection (c)   or   (d)   below shall be given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b). Each Bank that sells a participating interest shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the obligations under this Agreement (the    Participant Register    provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participating interest for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (c)    Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks, Approved Funds or other institutions (other a Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Bank) (each an    Assignee   ) all, or a proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and its Notes, if any, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of   Exhibit F   hereto (an    Assignment and Assumption Agreement   ) executed by  
  
   45 

such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with and subject to the subscribed consents of the Agent and (so long as an Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing) the Borrower, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;   provided   that no interest may be assigned by a Bank pursuant to this   subsection (c)   in an amount less than $15,000,000 unless (A) such lesser amount constitutes all of such assigning Bank s Commitment, or (B) the Agent and (so long as an Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing) the Borrower, in its sole discretion, otherwise consent to a lesser amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Assignee is an affiliate of a Bank or a Bank, (x) the subscribed consents of the Borrower and the Agent shall not be required and (y) the limitations set forth above shall not be applicable.  In all cases, any assignment to any Approved Fund requires the consent of the Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon execution and delivery of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent (and, in the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Bank s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto) and no further consent or action by any party shall be required, but the transferor Bank shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Article 8   with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this   subsection (c)  , the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.  Except as otherwise provided herein, in connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in the amount of $3,500, unless waived by the Agent in its sole discretion.  If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with   Section 2.14  . 
  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an Agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Agent s principal office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register as to the identity of the Banks and their respective Commitments shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  In addition, the Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Bank as a Defaulting Bank.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to this Agreement is pending, any Bank wishing to consult with other Banks in connection therewith may request and receive from the Agent a copy of the Register. 
  
   46 

(d)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Bank, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Bank to the Agent or any Bank hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in proportion to its Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Bank hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Bank for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
  (e)    Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note, if any, to a Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder. 
  (f)    No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank s rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 8.03   than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower s prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of   Section 8.02   or   8.03   requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. 
  (g)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank that is an Approved Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for the holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities,   provided   that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Bank in compliance with the other provisions of   Section 9.06(c)  , (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Bank from any of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Bank under this Agreement, including but not limited to rights to approve amendments, waivers or other modifications of any provision of this Agreement, even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise. 
  (h)    The words  execution ,  signed ,  signature , and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National  
  
   47 

Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
  (i)    No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower s affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Bank hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this   clause (B)  , or (C) to a natural Person (or a holding company investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person). 
  Section 9.07      Collateral  .  Each of the Banks represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon any  margin stock  (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement. 
  Section 9.08      Replacement of Banks  .  (a)  If any Bank requests compensation under   Section 8.03  , or if the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to   Section 8.02  , or if any Bank is a Defaulting Bank, or if any Bank is a Non-Extending Bank for any extension of the Termination Date, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank and the Agent, require such Bank to assign and delegate without unreasonable delay, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 9.06  ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Bank, if a Bank accepts such assignment),   provided   that: 
  (i)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 9.06(c)   (except as otherwise provided herein);   provided   that any Defaulting Bank shall pay to the Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 9.06(c)  ; 
  (ii)    such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including any amounts under   Section 2.13  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation by a Bank under   Section 8.03  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments that would otherwise result thereafter; and 
  (iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws. 
  A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  (b)    In the event any Bank fails to approve any amendment, waiver or consent requested by the Borrower pursuant to   Section 9.05   that has received the written approval  
  
   48 

of not less than the Required Banks but also requires the approval of such Bank (any such Bank, a    Restricted Bank   ), so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Borrower has obtained a commitment (in an amount not less than the entire amount of such Restricted Bank s Commitment) from one or more Banks or Assignees to become a Bank for all purposes hereunder (such Bank or Banks referred to as the    Replacement Bank   ), the Borrower may cause such Restricted Bank to be replaced by, and to assign all its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including its Commitment and its outstanding Loans) pursuant to   Section 9.06   to, such Replacement Bank.  Such Restricted Bank agrees to execute and to deliver to the Agent one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements with such Replacement Bank as provided in   Section 9.06   upon payment at par of all principal, accrued interest, accrued fees and other amounts accrued or owing under this Agreement to such Restricted Bank, and such Replacement Bank shall pay to the Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 9.06(c)   in connection with such assignment.  The Restricted Bank making such assignment will be entitled to compensation for any expenses or other amounts which would be owing to such Restricted Bank pursuant to any indemnification provision hereof (including, if applicable,   Section 2.12  ) as if the Borrower had prepaid the Loans of such Bank (and terminated its Commitment, if applicable) rather than such Restricted Bank having assigned its interest hereunder. 
  (c)    In each case of   clause (a)   and   (b)   above, the Agent shall distribute an amended schedule of Commitments, which shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement, to reflect changes in the identities of the Banks and adjustments of their respective Commitments and/or shares thereof resulting from any such replacement. 
  (d)    This section shall supersede any provision in   Section 9.05   to the contrary. 
  Section 9.09      Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial  .   
  (a)    This Agreement and each Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.  The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
  (b)    EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS  
  
   49 

REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

  FORM OF OPINION OF 
  COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER 

October 5, 2016 
    
  To the Banks and the Agent 
    Referred to Below 
  c/o Bank of America, N.A., as Agent 
  100 N. Tryon Street  
  Charlotte, North Carolina 28255-0001 
  Target Corporation 
  Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: 
    
  I am Senior Director, Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Target Corporation (the      Borrower     ), and I have acted as counsel to the Borrower in connection with the Five-Year Credit Agreement (the      Credit Agreement     ) dated as of October  5, 2016 among the Borrower, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof (the      Banks     ), the Co-Documentation Agents (the      Co-Documentation Agents     ) and Syndication Agent (the      Syndication Agent     ) listed therein and Bank of America, N.A., as Agent (in such capacity, the    Agent   ).  As such counsel, I, or the attorneys over whom I exercise supervision, have examined (i) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Borrower, as amended to date; (ii) the By-laws of the Borrower, as amended to date; and (iii) the corporate proceedings of the Borrower relating to the Credit Agreement.  I, or the attorneys over whom I exercise supervision, have also examined certificates of public officials and have made such other examinations as we have deemed necessary to enable me to give the opinions herein expressed. 
  In our examination, I, and the attorneys over whom I exercise supervision, have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to, and authenticity of the originals of, all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic or conformed documents.  In such examination we have relied on certificates of public officials as to the incorporation, good standing and valid existence of the Borrower, and, as to matters of fact, upon inquiry of officers of the Borrower and the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement. 
  All terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement. 
  Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 
  1.    The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where, in light of the nature of  
  
   D-1 

the business transacted or the property owned by it, such qualification is necessary and the failure so to qualify might permanently impair title to property material to its operations or its right to enforce a material contract against others, or expose it to substantial liability in such jurisdiction. 
  2.    The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered by Borrower to the Agent.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Debt of the Borrower or any other material agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  3.    There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the best of my knowledge threatened against, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or the Notes. 
  I am a member of the bar of the State of Minnesota and the foregoing opinions are limited to the Applicable Laws of the State of Minnesota. As used in this opinion.    Applicable Laws    shall mean those laws, rules and regulations of the State of Minnesota which in my experience, without having made any special investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement and the Notes, provided, that the term  Applicable Laws  shall not include securities or blue sky laws, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or voidable transaction laws, antifraud laws or commodities laws or, in each case, any rules or regulations thereunder. 
  This opinion letter is delivered solely to the Banks, the Co-Documentation Agents, the Syndication Agent and the Agent, and may not be relied upon by any other Person other than the addressees hereof, any successor or assignee of any addressee (including successive assignees), McGuireWoods LLP (who may rely upon this opinion as to matters of Minnesota law as if this opinion were addressed to such firm) and any Person who shall acquire a participation interest of any Bank (collectively, the    Reliance Parties   ).  This opinion letter may be relied upon only in connection with matters related to the Credit Agreement and then only as if it were delivered to the Reliance Party on the date hereof.  My opinions herein shall not be quoted or otherwise included, summarized or referred to in any publication or document, in whole or in part, for any purposes whatsoever, or furnished to any Person other than a Reliance Party (or a Person considering whether to become a Reliance Party), except as may be required of any Reliance Party by applicable law or regulation or in accordance with any auditing or oversight function or request of regulatory agencies to which a Reliance Party is subject.  
  Very truly yours,

  (vii)    for obligations to make an agreement in the future; 
  (viii)    that any act done in contravention thereof is void or voidable;  
  (ix)    for the survival of any claim beyond any applicable statute of limitation; 
  (x)    for the confession of or consent to any judgment; or 
  (xi)    for the severability of provisions in any Subject Document. 
  (g)      Remedies  .  The enforceability of any provision in any Subject Document to the effect that rights or remedies are not exclusive, that every right or remedy is cumulative and may be exercised in addition to any other right or remedy, that the election of some particular remedy does not preclude recourse to one or more others or that failure to exercise or delay in exercising rights or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy. 
  Qualifications and Limitations Applicable to Our Opinion 
  The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications and limitations: 
  (a)      Applicable Law  .  Our opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and applicable federal laws of the United States of America, and we do not express any opinion concerning any other law.  
  
   E-4 

(b)      Bankruptcy  .  Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, laws relating to preferences, fraudulent transfers and equitable subordination), reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors  rights generally. 
  (c)      Equitable Principles  .  Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.  In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in a Subject Document. 
  (d)      Unenforceability of Certain Provisions  .  Certain of the provisions contained in the Subject Documents may be unenforceable or ineffective, in whole or in part.  Such provisions include, without limitation, those which: require waivers or amendments to be made only in writing; authorize self-help or authorize any of the Lender Parties to act on behalf of, or exercise the rights of, the Borrower; violate applicable public policy; waive or do not require notice in connection with the exercise of remedies; authorize a standard for decision other than commercial reasonableness; purport to validate otherwise invalid provisions of other documents incorporated or referred to in any Subject Document; or subrogate any of the Lender Parties or any other party to the rights of others.  The inclusion of such provisions, however, does not render any Subject Document invalid as a whole, and each of the Subject Documents contains, in our opinion, adequate remedial provisions for the ultimate practical realization of the principal benefits purported to be afforded by such Subject Document, subject to the other qualifications contained in this opinion letter.  We note, however, that the unenforceability of such provisions may result in delays in enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Lender Parties under the Subject Documents, and we express no opinion as to the economic consequences, if any, of such delays.   
  (e)      Choice of New York Law and     Forum.  To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any Subject Document, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and Rule 327(b) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy, comity and constitutionality.  We express no opinion as to whether a United States federal court would have subject-matter or personal jurisdiction over a controversy arising under the Subject Documents. 
  (f)      Material Changes to Terms  .  Provisions in the Subject Documents which provide that any obligations of the Borrower thereunder will not be affected by the action or failure to act on the part of any Lender Party or by an amendment or waiver of the provisions contained in the other Subject Documents might not be enforceable under circumstances in which such action, failure to act, amendment or waiver so materially changes the essential terms of the obligations that, in effect, a new contract has arisen between the Lender Parties and the Borrower. 
  
   E-5 

(g)      Incorporated Documents  .  The foregoing opinion does not relate to (and we have not reviewed) any documents or instruments other than the Subject Documents, and we express no opinion as to (i) such other documents or instruments (including, without limitation, any documents or instruments referenced or incorporated in any of the Subject Documents), (ii) the interplay between the Subject Documents and any such other documents and instruments, or (iii) any schedule, exhibit, appendix or like supplemental document referred to as attached to any Subject Document if so attached or in any manner altered after our review of such document. 
  (h)      Mathematical Calculations  .  We have made no independent verification of any of the numbers, schedules, formulae or calculations in the Subject Documents, and we render no opinion with regard to the accuracy, validity or enforceability of any of them. 
  Miscellaneous 
  The foregoing opinion is being furnished only to the Lender Parties and only for the purpose referred to in the first paragraph of this opinion letter, and this opinion letter is not to be furnished to any other person or entity or used or relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent.  At your request, we hereby consent to (a) reliance hereon by any future assignee of any Bank s interest in the loans under the Credit Agreement pursuant to an assignment that is made and consented to in accordance with the express provisions of   Section 9.06(c)   of the Credit Agreement, on the condition and understanding that (i) this letter speaks only as of the date hereof, (ii) we have no responsibility or obligation to update this letter, to consider its applicability or correctness to any person other than its addressee(s), or to take into account changes in law, facts or any other developments of which we may later become aware, and (iii) any such reliance by a future assignee must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of assignment, including any changes in law, facts or any other developments known to or reasonably knowable by the assignee at such time; and (b) the furnishing of this opinion letter to (but not reliance upon this opinion letter by) any regulatory agency to which any Lender Party (or any successor or assignee permitted by the Credit Agreement) is subject, in accordance with any auditing or oversight function or other request of such regulatory agency, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 
  The opinion set forth herein is made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to supplement this opinion letter if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if we become aware after the date hereof of any facts that might change the opinion expressed herein.  Headings in this opinion letter are intended for convenience of reference only and shall not affect its interpretation. 
  Very truly yours,
