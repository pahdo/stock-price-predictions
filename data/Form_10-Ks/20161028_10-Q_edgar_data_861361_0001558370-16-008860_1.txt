NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

(Unaudited - In Millions, Except Per Share Data) 

Note 1.      Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. All adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods shown are of a normal recurring nature and have been reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period. The information included in these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the B/E Aerospace, Inc. (the  Company ) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Note 2.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which amends ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  . ASU 2016-09 includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. Earlier adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.     Accordingly, we plan to adopt ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017.     The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which supersedes ASC Topic 840,   Leases  , and creates a new topic, ASC Topic 842,   Leases  . This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. ASU 2016-02 will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09  , Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which supersedes the guidance in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  . The new standard was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which amended the effective date of this ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should identify the contract(s) with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s) and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be

Table of Contents  

applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business processes, systems, internal controls and disclosures and is currently unable to estimate the impact of adopting this guidance.  

Note 3.    Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using FIFO or the weighted average cost method. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. In accordance with industry practice, costs in inventory include amounts relating to long-term contracts with long production cycles and inventory items with long procurement cycles, some of which are not expected to be realized within one year. Work-in-process inventories include costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $96.7 and $87.7 and capitalized development costs on long-term seller furnished equipment contracts of $507.0 and $438.1 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Inventories consist of the following:    

Note 4.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

The table below sets forth the intangible assets by major asset class, all of which were acquired through business purchase transactions: 

Amortization expense of intangible assets was $4.4 and $4.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $13.5 and $12.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company currently expects to recognize amortization expense of approximately $17     in each of the next five fiscal years.   The future amortization amounts are estimates. Actual future amortization expense may be different due to future acquisitions, impairments, changes in amortization periods or other factors such as changes in exchange rates for assets acquired outside the United States.   The Company expenses costs to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset  .   

Goodwill increased $  0.7   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to foreign currency translations.

Note 5.    Related Party Transactions 

On December 16, 2014, we completed the spin-off of KLX Inc. ( KLX ) by means of the transfer of our Consumables Management Segment to KLX and the subsequent distribution to our stockholders of all the outstanding shares of KLX common stock (the  Spin-Off ). We retained our commercial aircraft and business jet segments.  

We entered into transitional services agreements with KLX prior to the Spin-Off pursuant to which we and KLX are providing various services to each other on an interim transitional basis. Transition services may be provided for up to 24 months, and for information technology services, KLX has an option for a one-year extension. This transitional support will enable KLX to establish its stand-alone processes for various activities that were previously provided by us and does not constitute significant continuing support of KLX s operations.  

In addition, we entered into a Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement with KLX. Under this agreement, we generally assume liability for all federal and state income taxes for all tax periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2014. 

Sales and cost of sales to KLX for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no material balances due to or due from KLX as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Total purchases from KLX were approximately $7.6 and $4.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $18.2 and $14.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 6.    Long-Term Debt  

The Company entered into a credit agreement dated as of December 16, 2014 (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) governing its senior secured bank credit facilities, consisting of (a) a five-year, $600.0 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and (b) a seven-year, $2,200.0 term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ). The most recent amendment to the Credit Agreement on May 27, 2016 decreased the effective borrowing rate, increased the amount available for dividend and share repurchases and provided greater flexibility to securitize assets. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) plus 200 basis points or prime (as defined therein) plus 100 basis points. There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus 300 basis points (LIBOR shall not be less than 75 basis points per annum) or ABR (as defined therein) plus 200 basis points (3.79% at September 30, 2016).  

As of September 30, 2016, long-term debt consisted of $2,064.0 outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, none of which was current.  On a net basis, after taking into consideration unamortized original issue discount and debt issue costs for the Term Loan Facility, total debt was $2,035.8.  

Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility aggregated $13.7 at September 30, 2016 ($7.7 at December 31, 2015). 

The Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest coverage ratio financial covenant (as defined therein) that must be maintained at a level greater than 3.0 to 1 and a total leverage ratio covenant (as defined therein) which limits gross debt to a 4.5 to 1 multiple of EBITDA (as defined therein). The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Company s assets and contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, restrictions on the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our stock, and conditions precedent for borrowings, all of which were met as of September 30, 2016.

Note 7.    Fair Value Measurements  

All   short-term financial instruments are generally carried at amounts that approximate estimated fair value. The fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. Assets measured at fair value are categorized based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations.  

Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2   quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents (which the Company classifies as Level 1 assets), accounts receivable   trade and accounts payable represent their respective fair values due to their short- term nature. The carrying value of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility approximates fair value based upon observable market data (which the Company classifies as Level 2). 

The fair value information presented herein is based on pertinent information available to management at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these condensed consolidated financial statements since those dates, and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 

Note 8.    Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Lease Commitments     The Company finances its use of certain facilities and equipment under committed lease arrangements provided by various institutions. Since the terms of these arrangements meet the accounting definition of operating lease arrangements, the aggregate sum of future minimum lease payments is not reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments under these arrangements approximated $172.6, the majority of which related to long-term real estate leases. 

Litigation     The Company is a defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management, neither individually nor in the aggregate, are likely to result in a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Indemnities, Commitments and Guarantees     During its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include non-infringement of patents and intellectual property indemnities to the Company s customers in connection with the design, manufacture, sale and delivery of its products, indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease, and indemnities to other parties to certain acquisition agreements. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases is indefinite. Many of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. However, the Company is unable to estimate the maximum amount of liability related to its indemnities, commitments and guarantees because such liabilities are contingent upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable. Management believes that any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees would not be material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, no significant amounts have been accrued for indemnities, commitments and guarantees.

Product Warranty Costs     Estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold. In estimating its future warranty obligations, the Company considers various relevant factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty.  

Note 9.    Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company has a Long-Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ) under which the Company s Compensation Committee has the authority to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other forms of equity-based or equity-related awards. 

Compensation cost generally is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the shares. Share-based compensation of $8.6 and $7.4 was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $24.7 and $20.9     was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the equity grants made pursuant to the LTIP. Unrecognized compensation expense related to equity grants, including the estimated impact of any future forfeitures, was $54.8 at September 30, 2016. 

The Company has established a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows qualified employees (as defined therein) to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the closing price at the end of each semi-annual stock purchase period. Compensation cost for this plan was not material to any of the periods presented. 

Note 10.     Segment Reporting  

The Company is organized based on the products and services it offers. The Company s reportable segments, which are also its operating segments, are comprised of commercial aircraft and business jet. Each segment regularly reports its results of operations and makes requests for capital expenditures and acquisition funding to the Company s chief operational decision-making group. This group is comprised of the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Each operating segment has separate management teams and infrastructures dedicated to providing a full range of products and services to their commercial, business jet, military, maintenance, repair and overhaul providers, aircraft leasing and aircraft manufacturing customers. The Company has not included product line information due to the similarity of commercial aircraft segment product offerings.  

The following table presents revenues and operating earnings by reportable segment: 

(1) 

Operating earnings includes an allocation of corporate IT costs, employee benefits and general and administrative costs based on the proportion of each segment s systems users, number of employees and sales, respectively.

Corporate capital expenditures have been allocated to the above segments in a manner consistent with our corporate expense allocations.     

The following table presents goodwill and total assets  (1)   by reportable segment: 

Note 11.    Net Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic net earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share is computed by using the weighted average common shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and restricted shares based on an average share price during the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 0.1 and 0.7 shares, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 0.3 and 0.6 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

The computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are as follows: 

Note 12.    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 

In accordance with ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes  , the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by   

11 

Table of Contents  

the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $81.1 and $89.0, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits. This liability, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate. The Company is currently undergoing a U.S. federal income tax examination for the year 2013. The Company is currently open to audit by the tax authorities for the eight tax years ended December 31, 2015.   

Note 13.    Restructuring and Other Charges 

During 2015, the Company recognized charges totaling $49.0 in connection with its cost reduction program. The charges reflect costs associated with facilities consolidation, product rationalization, workforce reductions and program discontinuance. The charges are included in the amounts and descriptions below, as appropriate.  The Company expects the cost reduction initiatives to offset inflationary pressures on wages, occupancy and infrastructure costs. The majority of the activities related to the cost reduction program are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 and future charges are not expected to be material.  

The following table presents the liability balance and activity related to restructuring and other charges: 

Note 14.    Subsequent Events 

On October 23, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Rockwell Collins, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Rockwell Collins ), and Quarterback Merger Sub Corp. ( Merger Sub ), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving (the  Surviving Corporation ) as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins (the  Merger  and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the  Transactions ). 

At the effective time of the Merger (the  Effective Time ), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ( B/E Aerospace Common Stock ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of the Company s Common Stock (i) held by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Rockwell Collins or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or (iii) that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the  DGCL )), will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration (the  Merger Consideration ) from Rockwell Collins, which will consist of (x) $34.10 per share in cash, without interest, and (y) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Rockwell Collins ( Rockwell Collins Common Stock ) equal to $27.90, subject to a two-way 7.5% collar as described in the Merger Agreement. 

The respective boards of directors of the Company and Rockwell Collins have unanimously approved the Merger Agreement, and the Board of Directors of the Company has agreed to recommend that the Company s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. In addition, the board of directors of Rockwell Collins has agreed to recommend that Rockwell Collins s stockholders approve the issuance of the shares of Rockwell Collins Common Stock forming part of the Merger Consideration, as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Company and Rockwell Collins each have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to directly or indirectly solicit competing alternative proposals and to terminate all   

12 

Table of Contents  

existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any persons with respect to any alternative proposal.  

The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including, among other things: (i) approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company s stockholders, (ii) approval of the issuance of the Rockwell Collins Common Stock forming part of the Merger Consideration by Rockwell Collins  stockholders and (iii) applicable regulatory approvals.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF   OPERATIONS 

(In Millions, Except Per Share Data)  

OVERVIEW 

The following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the discussion and analysis addresses our liquidity, financial condition and other matters for these periods. 

Based on our experience in the industry, we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and for business jets. We sell our products and provide our services directly to virtually all of the world s major airlines and aerospace manufacturers. In addition, based on our experience, we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories, which include: 

commercial aircraft seats, including an extensive line of super first class, first class, business class, tourist class and regional aircraft seats;     

a full line of aircraft food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, including coffee and espresso makers, water boilers, beverage containers, refrigerators, freezers, chillers and a line of ovens that includes microwave, high efficiency convection and steam ovens;     

modular lavatory systems, wastewater management systems and galley systems;     

both chemical and gaseous aircraft oxygen storage, distribution and delivery systems, protective breathing equipment and a broad range of lighting products; and     

business jet and general aviation interior products, including an extensive line of executive aircraft and helicopter seats, direct and indirect overhead lighting systems, exterior lighting systems, passenger and crew oxygen systems, air valve systems and high-end furniture and cabinetry.      

We provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration, program management and certification services. In addition, we also design, engineer and manufacture customized fully integrated thermal and power management solutions for participants in the defense industry, aerospace original equipment manufacturers ( OEM  or  OEMs ) and the airlines. 

We conduct our operations through strategic business units that have been aggregated under two reportable segments: commercial aircraft and business jet.  

On October 23, 2016, we announced that we entered into an agreement to be acquired by Rockwell Collins summarized in Note 14 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. If the Merger is consummated, we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins. Accordingly, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read with the understanding that, should the Merger be completed, Rockwell Collins will have the power to control the conduct of our business.

Revenues by domestic and foreign operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, were as follows: 

New product development is a strategic initiative for us. Our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities. We believe these activities protect and enhance our leadership position. We believe our investments in research and development over the past several years have been a driving force behind our ongoing market share gains and the growth of our backlog. Research, development and engineering spending was approximately 9.5% of revenues during the third quarter of 2016. We expect research and development expenditures to be approximately 10% of revenues over the next several years. 

We also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive. In that regard, we have invested, and will continue to invest, in property and equipment that enhance our productivity. Taking into consideration recent awards to deliver multi-year programs for various Boeing and Airbus aircraft, our targeted capacity utilization levels, recent acquisitions and current industry conditions, we expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately $85 during 2016. 

Strong long-term industry trends and a buyer furnished equipment business strategy which is leveraged to airline profitability and traffic growth continue to support our revenue growth outlook. Year-to-date global traffic is up 6% through August driven primarily by the growing middle classes around the world who have begun to access air travel. Air travel through September 30, 2016 in Asia Pacific and Middle East traffic is up 9% and 11%, respectively. The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) continues to expect record aggregate airline profits in 2016, which will be the seventh consecutive year of global airline profitability. In

addition, 2016 is expected to be the second year in succession that the global airline industry s return on invested capital exceeded their cost of capital. Strong traffic growth and record airline profitability are generating high levels of aircraft deliveries by both Airbus and Boeing. Longer term, global airline traffic is expected to grow at a rate of about 4.5% to 5% annually, driven by the emerging middle classes around the world and ever increasing access to air travel.   

In contrast to the strength in the commercial airline market, the business jet OEM market has been, and is expected to continue to be, adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors such as the collapse of oil prices, the developing country currency crisis and global economic uncertainty. As a result the business jet fleet remains in a state of significant oversupply with many used business jets at substantially lower and declining prices as compared to new business jets. Industry experts are expecting a decline of approximately 10% in new business jet deliveries in 2016 as compared to 2015 as well as lower business jet deliveries in 2017 as compared to 2016. In addition, the civilian helicopter market has also been adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors, including particularly the collapse in oil prices. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016,   COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

Third quarter 2016 revenues of $732.7 increased 7.8%, as compared with the prior year period. Revenues increased due to revenue growth of 14.0% in the Commercial Aircraft Segment ( CAS ), which was partially offset by a reduction in revenues of 10.5% in the Business Jet Segment ( BJS ). 

During the prior year period, the Company recognized restructuring charges totaling $49.0, or $30.5 after-tax, in connection with its cost reduction program. The charges reflect costs associated with facilities consolidation, product rationalization, workforce reductions and program discontinuance. These costs are included in the amounts and descriptions below, unless indicated otherwise. The Company believes that using measures which exclude the 2015 restructuring charges is relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to have a better understanding of changes in the Company s performance excluding the 2015 charges associated with the Company s cost reduction program. 

Cost of sales for the current period was $457.5, or 62.4% of revenues, as compared with cost of sales of $424.4, or 62.4% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $15.3, gross margin decreased 220 basis points due to lower revenues and an unfavorable product mix at BJS in the current year period.

Table of Contents  

Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $73.7, or 10.1% of revenues, as compared with SG A expense of $106.4, or 15.7% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $28.8, SG A expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 130 basis points as a result of cost reduction initiatives.  

Engineering, research and development ( ER D ) expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $69.5, or 9.5% of revenues, as compared with $73.8, or 10.9% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $4.9, ER D expense increased $0.6 as a result of program mix and higher engineering expense related to development programs.  

Third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $132.0 increased $56.8, or 75.5%, and operating margin of 18.0% increased 690 basis points, each as compared to the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $49.0, third quarter 2016 operating earnings increased $7.8, or 6.3%, and operating margin of 18.0% decreased 30 basis points primarily as a result of lower margins at BJS as compared with the prior year period. 

Interest expense in the current period of $22.4 decreased by $1.6, or 6.7%, as compared with the prior year period as the result of a lower amount of outstanding debt in the current year period.  

Third quarter 2016 earnings before income taxes were $109.6, an increase of $58.4, or 114.1%, as compared with the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $49.0, third quarter 2016 earnings before income taxes increased $9.4, or 9.4%, as compared with the prior year period. 

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was approximately 24.0% as compared with approximately 10.5% in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges, income tax expense increased $2.8, or 11.9%, as compared with the prior year period. We expect our full year income tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 24.0%. 

Third quarter 2016 net earnings and net earnings per diluted share were $83.3 and $0.83 per share, representing increases of 81.9% and 88.6%, respectively, as compared with the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $30.5 after-tax, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased 8.6% and 13.7%, respectively, as compared with the prior year period. Net earnings per share in the current period benefitted from fewer shares outstanding as a result of the Company s share repurchase program. 

Bookings during the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $835 and the book-to-bill ratio for the third quarter of 2016 was approximately 1.15:1. Booked backlog at September 30, 2016 increased $200 to $3.4 billion as compared to September 30, 2015, while awarded but unbooked was approximately $5.6 billion. Total backlog, both booked and awarded but unbooked, was approximately $9.0 billion.  

SEGMENT RESULTS 

Third quarter 2016 CAS revenues of $578.8 increased 14.0% as compared with the prior year period. The revenue increase was driven primarily by higher volumes of both buyer furnished equipment and seller furnished equipment. Operating earnings of $108.9 increased 62.8% and operating margin of 18.8% increased 560 basis points, each as compared with the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $29.3, operating earnings increased 13.2% and operating margin decreased 10 basis points.     

Third quarter 2016 BJS revenues of $153.9 decreased 10.5% as compared with the prior year period.  The year-over-year revenue decline reflects the broad-based downturn in the new business jet and civilian helicopter markets as well as lower volumes of super first class seating products. Operating earnings increased $14.8 to $23.1 and operating margin was 15.0%. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $19.7, operating earnings of $23.1 decreased 17.5% on the 10.5% decline in revenues and operating margin decreased 130 basis points.

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, 

AS COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues of $2,202.5 increased 6.4%, as compared with the prior year period. Revenues increased due to revenue growth of 11.0% in the CAS, which was partially offset by a reduction in revenues of 8.3% in the BJS. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized charges totaling $49.0, or $30.5 after-tax, in connection with its cost reduction program. These costs are included in the amounts and descriptions below, unless indicated otherwise. 

Cost of sales for the current nine month period was $1,341.9, or 60.9% of revenues, as compared with cost of sales of $1,246.1, or 60.2% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $15.3, gross margin decreased 150 basis points due to lower revenues and an unfavorable product mix at BJS reflecting the difficult industry conditions impacting BJS in the current year period. 

SG A expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $245.4, or 11.1% of revenues, as compared with SG A expense of $279.7, or 13.5% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $28.8, SG A expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 100 basis points as a result of cost reduction initiatives. 

ER D expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $217.2, or 9.9% of revenues, as compared with $216.4, or 10.5% of revenues, in the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $4.9, ER D expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 30 basis points as a result of program mix, within both CAS and BJS. We expect that ER D expense will approximate 10% of revenues for the full year 2016. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating earnings of $398.0 increased $69.8, or 21.3%, and operating margin of 18.1% increased 220 basis points, each as compared to the prior year period. Excluding prior year period restructuring charges of $49.0, operating earnings increased $20.8, or 5.5%, and operating margin decreased 10 basis points primarily as a result of lower margins at BJS as compared with the prior year period. 

Interest expense in the current nine month period of $68.2 decreased by $4.2, or 5.8%, as compared with the prior year period as the result of a lower amount of outstanding debt in the current year period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Current Financial Condition 

Cash on hand at September 30, 2016 decreased by $28.3 as compared with cash on hand at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $76.8, dividend payments of $63.3 and capital expenditures of $57.4, offset by cash flows from operating activities of $173.2. Shares repurchased included amounts purchased from employees in connection with the settlement of income tax and related benefit withholding obligations arising from vesting of restricted stock grants under the Company s Long-Term Incentive Plan. The substantial majority of our cash is held within the United States, and all of our foreign cash may be brought back into the United States in a tax efficient manner. Our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs, ongoing capital expenditures, payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness and any dividends or share repurchases. Our primary requirements for working capital are directly related to the level of our operations.  

Working capital as of September 30, 2016 was $971.4, an increase of $135.2 as compared with working capital at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, total current assets increased by $212.1 and total current liabilities increased by $76.9, each as compared to December 31, 2015. Total current assets increased primarily as a result of a $160.1 increase in inventories and a $77.7 increase in accounts receivable (both net of foreign currency translations) to support future revenue growth. The increase in total current liabilities was due to a $35.4 increase in accounts payable and a $41.5 increase in other current liabilities. 

We entered into our Credit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2014 (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) consisting of (a) a five-year, $600.0 revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and (b) a seven-year, $2,200.0 term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ).   The most recent amendment to the Credit Agreement on May 27, 2016 lowered the effective borrowing rate, increased the amount available for dividend and share repurchases and provided greater flexibility to securitize assets.   There were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in December 2019 unless terminated earlier. Outstanding long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 consisted of $2,064.0 outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, none of which was current. On a net basis, after taking into consideration the unamortized original issue discount and debt issue costs for the Term Loan Facility, total debt was $2,035.8.  

Cash Flows 

As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $125.8 as compared to $154.1 at December 31, 2015. Cash generated from operating activities was $173.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $190.4 in the same period in the prior year. The primary sources of cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were net earnings of $250.7, adjusted for depreciation and amortization of $62.0 and non-cash compensation of $25.8. Offsetting these sources of cash were an increase in accounts receivable of $86.5 and a $174.3 increase in inventories to support our backlog. 

Capital Spending 

Our capital expenditures were $57.4 and $63.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $85 during 2016. These capital expenditures are needed to support our total backlog of approximately $9.0 billion ($3.4 billion booked and $5.6 billion awarded but unbooked). Our capital spending also takes into consideration our targeted capacity utilization levels and current industry conditions. We have, in the past, generally funded our capital expenditures with cash from operations and funds available to us under revolving bank credit facilities. We expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand, from operations and from funds available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Payment of Cash Dividends and Share Repurchase Program 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our common stock, resulting in total dividends of $21.1. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we declared cash dividends of $0.63 per share on our common stock, resulting in total dividends of $63.3. 

On November 11, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $400.0 share repurchase program. There were no shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to its share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had $174.7 of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.  

Outstanding Debt and Other Financing Arrangements 

Outstanding long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 consisted of $2,064.0 outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, none of which was current. On a net basis, after taking into consideration the unamortized original issue discount and debt issue costs for the Term Loan Facility, total debt was $2,035.8.  

The Credit Agreement provides an option to request additional incremental revolving credit borrowing capacity and incremental term loans, in each case upon the satisfaction of certain customary terms and conditions.  

Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets, including a pledge of a portion of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries owned directly. Amounts borrowed and outstanding under the Term Loan Facility will, in certain circumstances, be required to be prepaid with the proceeds from certain asset sales, subject to certain thresholds and reinvestment rights. The Term Loan Facility amortizes at 1% of the initial funded principal amount annually, with the balance due for repayment at final maturity in December 2021. At the Company s election, the Credit Agreement allows for the prepayment of the Term Loan Facility to be applied to reduce any subsequent scheduled amortization payments. Unless terminated earlier or extended, the Revolving Credit Facility will mature in December 2019. 

The Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest coverage ratio financial covenant (as defined therein) that must be maintained at a level greater than 3.0 to 1 and a total leverage ratio covenant (as defined therein) which limits gross debt to a 4.5 to 1 multiple of EBITDA (as defined therein). The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, restrictions on the payment of dividends and the repurchase of our stock and conditions precedent for borrowing. We were in compliance with all of the covenants, restrictions and conditions precedent in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016.

Contractual Obligations 

The following table reflects our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2016. Commercial commitments include lines of credit, guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that may require performance by us or our subsidiaries pursuant to a funding commitment.  

(1) 

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $81.1 at September 30, 2016 has been omitted from the above table because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled. It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months; however, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.     

(2) 

We enter into purchase commitments for production materials and other items. We also enter into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders, other documentation or with an invoice. Such obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected as purchase obligations in this table.     

(3) 

Interest payments include interest payments due on the Term Loan Facility based on minimum principal payments and using LIBOR as in effect at September 30, 2016 which was the higher of three-month LIBOR or 0.75%. Actual interest payments on the Term Loan Facility and, to the extent we draw under it, the Revolving Credit Facility, will fluctuate based on LIBOR or ABR pursuant to their terms.      

We believe that our cash flows, together with cash on hand and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, provide us with the ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled debt service payments and fund dividends and share repurchases, if any, for at least the next twelve months. However, such cash flows are dependent upon our future operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, including the conditions of our markets, some of which are beyond our control. If, in the future, we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service or other obligations, we will need to refinance such debt obligations, obtain additional financing or sell assets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash from operations or that we will be able to obtain financing from other sources sufficient to satisfy our debt service, dividend, share repurchase or other requirements. 

On October 23, 2016, we announced that we entered into an agreement to be acquired by Rockwell Collins summarized in Note 14 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Lease Arrangements 

We finance our use of certain equipment under committed lease arrangements provided by various financial institutions. Since the terms of these arrangements meet the accounting definition of operating lease arrangements, the aggregate sum of future minimum lease payments is not reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our aggregate future minimum lease payments under these arrangements total approximately $172.6 at September 30, 2016.

Table of Contents  

Indemnities, Commitments and Guarantees 

During the normal course of business, we have made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include non-infringement of patents and intellectual property indemnities to our customers in connection with the design, manufacture, sale and delivery of our products, indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease, and indemnities to other parties to certain acquisition agreements. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. We believe that many of our indemnities, commitments and guarantees provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make. However, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of liability related to our indemnities, commitments and guarantees because such liabilities are contingent upon the occurrence of events which are not reasonably determinable. Management believes that any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees would not be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Backlog  

We record backlog when we enter into a definitive order for the delivery of products to our customers in the future. Within backlog, we differentiate between booked backlog and awarded but unbooked backlog. Generally if there are definitive delivery dates then the backlog is considered booked. When we receive the delivery date specificity in writing from our customers on these long-term contracts, management includes such amount in booked backlog. If a contract does not provide that level of specificity, the production requirements are generally provided to us through periodic purchase orders issued against the underlying contracts at which point the amount of the purchase orders is classified as booked. The remaining portion of the underlying contract is considered awarded but unbooked. In addition, purchase orders for end items and spares are generally received and recorded as backlog when we accept their terms. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Critical     accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information to investors. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q ) includes forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects, liquidity, expenditures, payment of dividends, repurchase of shares and ability to complete the planned acquisition by Rockwell Collins. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical in nature or are not current facts. We have tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words including  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,   should,   will  and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance, prospects and ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. These factors include the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors discussed under the headings  Item 1A. Risk Factors,  as well as  Item 1. Business,   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, including: future events that may have the effect of reducing our available operating income and cash balances, such as unexpected operating losses, the impact of rising fuel prices on our airline customers,

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of our variable-rate debt. 

Foreign Currency     We have direct operations in Europe and the Philippines that receive revenues from customers primarily in U.S. dollars. We purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors primarily in U.S. dollars and to a lesser extent, British pounds, Euros and Philippine pesos. Our European and Philippine labor is primarily sourced in local currencies. Accordingly, we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. 

From time to time, we and our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies. At September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts. In addition, we have not entered into any other derivative financial instruments. 

Interest Rates     As of September 30, 2016, we had $2.1 billion of adjustable rate debt outstanding. We do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. If adjustable interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, we estimate annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $7.7 million.  

As of September 30, 2016, we maintained a portfolio of cash and securities consisting mainly of taxable, interest-bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months. If short-term interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, we estimate interest income would increase or decrease by less than $0.1 million.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   

The following risk factor is related to the proposed acquisition of the Company by Rockwell Collins. In addition to the information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I, Item IA.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Failure to complete, or delays in completing, the transaction with Rockwell Collins announced on October 23, 2016. 

On October 23, 2016, the Company, entered into the Merger Agreement with Rockwell Collins, as described in Note 14 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The summary of the Merger Agreement and the descriptions of the terms and conditions therein do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.  

We cannot assure you at this time that the parties will be able to complete the Merger as contemplated under the Merger Agreement or at all. Risks related to the pending status of the Merger and related transactions, and/or failure to complete the Merger, include the following:  

The possibility that the Merger might not be consummated in the time frame expected by the Company and Rockwell Collins, or at all, and the risks and costs to the Company in such event, including the diversion of management and employee attention and the potential disruptive effect on business and customer relationships, stock price and ability to attract and retain key management personnel and employees;     

The possibility that one or more closing conditions to the Merger, including certain regulatory approvals, may not be satisfied or waived, on a timely basis or otherwise, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Merger, may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals or that the required approval by the stockholders of the Company or Rockwell Collins may not be obtained;     

The Company may incur unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the Merger and related transactions;     

The Company will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs related to the Merger, whether or not it is consummated;     

The Merger Agreement contains  no solicitation  provisions that, subject to certain limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any third party proposals for the acquisition of our common stock or to pursue an unsolicited offer;     

The Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $200 million to Rockwell Collins if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement under certain conditions, which may deter third parties that might be interested in exploring an acquisition of the Company;     

The attention of the Company management and employees may be diverted from day-to-day operations during the period up to the completion of the Merger;     

The Company s business, including both ordinary course and other transactions, may be disrupted as a result of the announcement of the Merger and the likelihood of litigation arising in connection with the Merger;     

27 

Table of Contents  

The Company s executive officers and members of its Board of Directors may be deemed to have interests in the Merger that may be different from or in addition to those of the Company s stockholders, generally, which may create potential conflicts of interest;     

Under the Merger Agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of business prior to completing the Merger, including generally requiring the Company to conduct its business only in the ordinary course, subject to specified limitations, and that the Company will not undertake various actions related to the conduct of its business without the prior written consent of Rockwell Collins, which may delay or prevent the Company from responding to changing market and business conditions and could adversely affect our ability to conduct business as we otherwise could have done without these restrictions;     

The expected financial performance of the combined company following the completion of the Merger remains uncertain;     

It is possible that the combined company will fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including as a result of delay in completing the Merger or integrating the businesses of the Company and Rockwell Collins;     

It is uncertain how well the combined business will be able to implement its business strategy; and     

The combined business may experience difficulties and delays in achieving synergies and cost savings.     

The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
