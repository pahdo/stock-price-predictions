NOODLES   COMPANY 
  COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS      AMENDED AND RESTATED JULY 25, 2016 
    
  I.   PURPOSE    
  1.1 The purpose of the Noodles   Company Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (this  Plan ) is to provide a comprehensive compensation program to attract and retain qualified individuals who are not employed by Noodles   Company (the  Company ) or its subsidiaries to serve on the Company s Board of Directors. In particular, this Plan aligns the interests of such directors with those of the Company s shareholders by providing that a significant portion of such directors  compensation is directly linked to the value of the Company s common stock.  This amendment and restatement of the Plan is effective beginning July 25, 2016. 
  1.2    Non-Covered Non-Employee Directors  .  This Plan shall not apply to any non-employee director serving on the Company s Board of Directors who formerly held a management position at the Company, and no such individual shall be eligible for any grants or payments hereunder.  For purposes of this Plan a  management position  is defined to include the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, and equivalent positions thereto. 
  II.   CASH RETAINERS    
  2.1   Annual Board Retainer  . Except as provided in Section 2.4 of this Plan, each non-employee director shall be entitled to receive an annual cash retainer for his or her Board service, in such amount as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time, which shall be payable in quarterly installments. As of December 30, 2015, this amount is $50,000. 
  2.2   Committee Retainer  . A non-employee director appointed as a member of a standing committee of the Board of Directors shall receive an annual cash retainer, payable in quarterly installments, in such amount as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. These committee retainers are in addition to the annual retainer set forth in Section 2.1 above.  
  2.3   Retainer for Committee Chairs  . A non-employee director appointed to chair a standing committee of the Board of Directors shall be paid an annual cash retainer, payable in quarterly installments, in such amount as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. These committee chair retainers are in addition to the retainers set forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.  
  2.4   Retainer for Chairman of the Board of Directors  .  A non-employee director appointed to act as Chairman of the Board of Directors ( Chairman ) shall receive an annual cash retainer for his or her Board service and service as Chairman, in such amount as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time, which shall be paid in monthly installments.  As of July 25, 2016, this amount is $100,000 per annum.  Retainer payments under this Section 2.4 are in lieu of any payments under Section 2.1 of this Plan. 
  2.5   Pro-Rata Retainer  . A non-employee director who commences service after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders shall be entitled to a pro-rated annual cash retainer as well as pro-rated annual committee and committee chair retainers, or a retainer for acting as Chairman, as applicable, and as approved by the incumbent non-employee directors. The amount of the retainer(s) shall be determined based on the number of full months during the year that a new non-employee director is in active service. The pro-rated portion of the annual retainer, if any, shall be payable in quarterly installments. 
  2.6    Equity Sponsors  .  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article II, for directors affiliated with the Company s Equity Sponsors, the cash retainer for the period from July 1, 2016 through the end of the fiscal year commencing December 30, 2015 only shall be $25,000, which amount shall be payable in equal installments in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  No cash retainer shall be payable to such directors for any period prior to July 1, 2016.  For subsequent fiscal years, the foregoing provisions of this Article II shall apply.  For purposes of this Plan, Equity Sponsors shall mean Catterton Partners and Public Service Pension Board of Canada. 

III.   EQUITY AWARDS    
  3.1   Company s Stock Incentive Plan  . Grants of equity awards made under this Plan shall be made under the Company s stock incentive plan that is in effect from time to time ( Stock Plan ). The terms  Fair Market Value  and  Stock  used in this Article III shall have the meanings set forth in the Stock Plan.  
  3.2   Annual Retainer Grants  . Except as provided in Section 3.3 of this Plan, at the close of business on the date of each Annual Meeting of Shareholders, each non-employee director who then continues as a member of the Board of Directors may be granted restricted stock units ( RSUs ) in such amounts as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may grant any one or more of the awards set forth under the Stock Plan in such amounts and on such terms as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time.

  3.3   Annual Chairman Retainer Grants  .  A non-employee director acting as Chairman will receive RSUs in such amounts as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time.

The amount of the award shall be determined based on the number of full months during the year that a new non-employee director is in active service.  
  3.6   Settlement of RSUs  . The RSUs shall be settled by delivering shares of Stock promptly following vesting.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of the non-employee director, settlement of the Stock may be deferred until the earlier of the director s separation from Board service or a change in control of the Company, provided that any such election shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
  IV.   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS    
  4.1  For periods prior to July 1, 2016, no compensation shall be payable under this Plan to directors affiliated with the Company s Equity Sponsors.  
  4.2 This Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors, which shall have the power to interpret this Plan and amend it from time to time as it deems proper. To the fullest extent practicable, however, the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan shall be applicable to equity awards granted under this Plan.  
  4.3 This Plan may be suspended or terminated at any time by action of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding any such suspension or termination, the Company shall remain obligated to pay cash retainer amounts earned but not yet paid and any outstanding equity awards under this Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of this Plan as in effect at the time of such suspension or termination, the Stock Plan or a prior stock plan, as applicable, and any applicable stock incentive award agreements.  
  4.4 Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, the right to receive any compensation under this Plan, whether under new or outstanding equity awards, may not be transferred, assigned, or subject to attachment or other legal process.  
  4.5 To the extent any amounts paid under this Plan are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, this Plan will be interpreted in a manner to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  
  
   2 

4.6 Subject to Sections 4.3 and 4.4 above, any outstanding equity awards under this Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of this Plan as in effect at the time such awards were granted.  
  4.7 This Plan shall be governed by and subject to the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal laws.

   44 

or (B) a Committed Loan Notice;   provided   that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice.  Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (ii) four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans  .

Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $250,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Except as provided in   Sections 2.03(c)   and   2.04(c)  , each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $250,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 in excess thereof.

If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans;   provided  ,   however  , that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, such Loans shall be continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans in Canadian Dollars with an Interest Period of one (1) month.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swing Line Loan may not be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan.  Except as provided pursuant to   Section 2.02(c)  , no Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be repaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. 
  
   45 

(b)        Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage under the Facility of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, in each case as described in   Section 2.02(a)  .  In the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent s Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice.  Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension,   Section 4.01  ), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower;   provided  ,   however  , that if, on the date a Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Credit Borrowing denominated in Dollars is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing,   first  , shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and   second  , shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above. 
  (c)        Except as otherwise provided in   Section 3.05  , a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan.  During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Dollars be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans and any or all of the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars be converted immediately to Canadian Prime Rate Loans. 
  (d)        The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  At any time that Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate or the Canadian Prime Rate, as applicable, promptly following the public announcement of such change.

  (f)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing,  
  
   46 

extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.

  (iv)        The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in  
  
   48 

its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. 
  (v)        The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in   Article IX   with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term  Administrative Agent  as used in   Article IX   included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.

Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer.  Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be.

Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in   Article IV   shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicabl  e Revolving Credit Percentage   times   the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
  (ii)        If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an    Auto-Extension Letter of Credit      provided   that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the    Non-Extension Notice Date   ) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;   provided  ,   however  , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of   Section 2.03(a)   or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   Section 4.02   is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
  
   50 

(iii)        Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
  (c)        Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations  .  (1)  Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  Not later than 12:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an    Honor Date   ), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the    Unreimbursed Amount   ), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof.  In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in   Section 2.02   for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice).  Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)(i)   may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;   provided   that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
  (i)        Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of   Section 2.03(c)(iii)  , each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. 
  (ii)        With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer  
  
   51 

pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(ii)   shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this   Section 2.03  . 
  (iii)        Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
  (iv)        Each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this   Section 2.03(c)  , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (v)        If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.03(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.03(c)(ii)  , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this   Section 2.03(c)(vi)   shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  
   52 

(d)        Repayment of Participations  .  (1)  At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with   Section 2.03(c)  , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to such Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
  (i)        If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in   Section 11.05   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent,   plus   interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
  (i)        any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
  (ii)        the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
  (iii)        any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
  
   53 

(iv)        any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or 
  (v)        any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly (but in any event within one (1) Business Day thereafter) notify the L/C Issuer.  The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
  (f)        Role of L/C Issuer  .  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;   provided  ,   however  , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of   Section 2.03(e)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer s willful misconduct or  
  
   54 

gross negligence or the L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.  The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (   SWIFT   ) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
  (g)        Applicability of ISP  .  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is   issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit),   the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.

The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the    Letter of Credit Fee   ) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate for Letter of Credit Fees   times   the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit;   provided  , however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this   Section 2.03   shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to   Section 2.15(a)(iv)  , with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account.

If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any Event of Default under   Section 8.01(a)  ,   Section 8.01(f)   or   Section 8.01(g)  , all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate and, upon all other Events of Default, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate at the request of the Required Lenders.

For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with   Section 1.06  .  In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

   56 

the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment;   provided  ,   however  , that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility at such time, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender at such time,   plus   such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time,   plus   such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans at such time shall not exceed such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment, and   provided     further   that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this   Section 2.04  , prepay under   Section     2.05  , and reborrow under this   Section 2.04  .  Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest only at a rate equal to the rate that would be applicable to a Base Rate Loan from time to time;   provided  ,   however  , that if an Autoborrow Agreement is in effect, the Swing Line Lender may, at its discretion, provide for an alternate rate of interest on Swing Line Loans under the Autoborrow Agreement with respect to any Swing Line Loans for which the Swing Line Lender has not requested that the Revolving Credit Lenders fund Revolving Credit Loans to refinance, or to purchase and fund risk participations in, such Swing Line Loans pursuant to   Section 2.04(c)  .  Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage   times   the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
  (b)        Borrowing Procedures  .  (1) Subject to   Section 2.04(a)  , and at any time an Autoborrow Agreement is not in effect, each Borrowing of Swing Line Loans shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by:  (A) telephone or (B) a Swing Line Loan Notice;   provided   that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swing Line Loan Notice.  Each such Swing Line Loan Notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day).  Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request  
  
   57 

of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of   Section 2.04(a)  , or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   Article IV   is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds. 
  (i)        In order to facilitate the borrowing of Swing Line Loans, the Borrower and the Swing Line Lender may mutually agree to, and are hereby authorized to, enter into an Autoborrow Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender (the    Autoborrow Agreement   ) providing for the automatic advance by the Swing Line Lender of Swing Line Loans under the conditions set forth in such agreement, which shall be in addition to the conditions set forth herein.  At any time an Autoborrow Agreement is in effect, the requirements for Swing Line Borrowings set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph shall not apply, and all Borrowings of Swing Line Loans shall be made in accordance with the Autoborrow Agreement;   provided   that any automatic advance made by Bank of America in reliance of the Autoborrow Agreement shall be deemed a Swing Line Loan as of the time such automatic advance is made notwithstanding any provision in the Autoborrow Agreement to the contrary.  For purposes of determining the Outstanding Amount under the Aggregate Commitments at any time during which an Autoborrow Agreement is in effect, the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit.  For purposes of any Swing Line Borrowing pursuant to the Autoborrow Agreement, all references to Bank of America in the Autoborrow Agreement shall be deemed to be a reference to Bank of America, in its capacity as Swing Line Lender hereunder. 
  (c)        Refinancing of Swing Line Loans  .  (1)  The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of   Section 2.02  , without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02  .  The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount specified in such  
  
   58 

Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to   Section 2.04(c)(ii)  , each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. 
  (i)        If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit  Borrowing in accordance with   Section 2.04(c)(i)  , the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to   Section 2.04(c)(i)   shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
  (ii)        If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.04(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.04(c)(i)  , the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (iii)        Each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this   Section 2.04(c)   shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this  
  
   59 

Section 2.04(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02  .  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (d)        Repayment of Participations  .  (1)  At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
  (i)        If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in   Section 11.05   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent,   plus   interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)        Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender  .  The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans.  Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this   Section 2.04   to refinance such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
  (f)        Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender  .  The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.

Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to   Section 2.13(a)  , bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  (a)        If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of   the Borrower   or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio as calculated by   the Borrower   as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal  
  
   65 

to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under   Section 2.03(c)(iii)  ,   2.03(i)   or   2.08(b)   or under   Article VIII  .  The Borrower s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
  2.11        Evidence of Debt  . 
  (a)        The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
  (b)        In addition to the accounts and records referred to in   Section 2.11(a)  , each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
  2.12        Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback  . 
  (a)        General  .  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars shall  
  
   66 

be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in Canadian Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in Canadian Dollars, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected on computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
  (b)        (1)      Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   Section 2.02   (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by   Section 2.02  ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the  
  
   67 

Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  (i)        Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
  (c)        Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent  .  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this   Article II  , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in   Article IV   are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) promptly to such Lender, without interest. 
  (d)        Obligations of Lenders Several  .  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to   Section 11.04(c)   are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under   Section 11.04(c)   on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under   Section 11.04(c)  . 
  (e)        Funding Source  .  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
  
   68 

(f)        Insufficient Funds  .  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)   first  , toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)   second  , toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then due to such parties. 
  2.13        Sharing of Payments by Lenders  .  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be,   provided   that: 
  (i)        if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
  (ii)        the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in   Section 2.14    
  
   69 

or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 
  2.14        Cash Collateral  . 
  (a)        Certain Credit Support Events  .    Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to   Section 2.15(a)(iv)   and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
  (b)        Grant of Security Interest  .    All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to   Section 2.14(c)  .  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 
  (c)        Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this   Section 2.14   or   Sections 2.03  ,   2.04  ,   2.05  ,   2.15     or   8.02   in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied   to the satisfaction of  
  
   70 

the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
  (d)        Release  .  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with   Section 11.06(b)(vi)  )) or (ii) the Administrative Agent s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;   provided  , however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (and following application as provided in this   Section 2.14   may be otherwise applied in accordance with   Section 8.03  ), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
  2.15        Defaulting Lenders  . 
  (a)        Adjustments  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
  (i)        Waivers and Amendments  .  That Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in   Section 11.01  . 
  (ii)        Reallocation of Payments  .  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to   Article VIII   or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 11.08  ), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:    first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;   second  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;   third  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan;   fourth  , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;  
  
   71 

fifth  , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower,   to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy   obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;   sixth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and   eighth  , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this   Section 2.15(a)(ii)   shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)        Certain Fees  .      A Defaulting Lender (x) shall     not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to   Section 2.09(a)   for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in   Section 2.03(h)  . 
  (iv)        Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to   Sections 2.03   and   2.04  , the  Applicable Percentage  of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of that Defaulting Lender;   provided  , that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender   minus   (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of that Lender. 
  
   72 

(b)        Defaulting Lender Cure  .    If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to   Section 2.15(a)(iv)  ), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  2.16        [  Increase in Revolving Credit Facility  .  ]  [Reserved.] 
  [  (a)      Request for Increase  .  Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Revolving Credit Lenders), the Borrower may on a one-time basis, request an increase in the Revolving Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $15,000,000.  At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Revolving Credit Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Revolving Credit Lenders).      ] 
  [  (b)      Lender Elections to Increase  .  Each Revolving Credit Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than  ]     its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage  [     of such requested increase.  Any Revolving Credit Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Revolving Credit Lender shall be obligated to participate in such increase and the decision to participate in such increase shall be in the sole discretion of the applicable Revolving Credit Lender.  ] 
  [  (c)      Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Revolving Credit Lenders  .  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Revolving Credit Lender of the Revolving Credit Lenders  responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of the requested increase, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower may also  
  
   73 

invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.  ] 
  [  (d)      Effective Date and Allocations  .  If the Revolving Credit Facility is increased in accordance with this     Section 2.16  , the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the    Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date   ) and the final allocation of such increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Revolving Credit Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date.  ] 
  [  (e)      Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase  .  As a condition precedent to such increase, (i) the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (y) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this     Section 2.16  , the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of     Section 5.05     shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), respectively, of     Section 6.01     and (z) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing or would result therefrom, (ii) commitments from applicable Lenders or Eligible Assignees shall have been received in an amount no less than the amount of such requested increase and (iii) the Borrower shall pay all reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees and costs of counsel to the Administrative Agent and Arranger) incurred in connection with this     Section 2.16  .  So long as the Borrower shall have complied with all other conditions contained in this     Section 2.16  , the Lenders hereby consent, without the need for further or subsequent consent but subject to     Section 2.16(b)  , to an amendment to this agreement to the extent necessary to evidence and document an increase in the Revolving Credit Facility so long as any terms applicable to any such increase are on the same terms as the existing Revolving Credit Facility.  Any such amendment shall only require the consent of the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or lenders participating in such increase.  Each Loan Party shall acknowledge and agree that the Obligations of such Loan Party extend to and include the Obligations after giving effect to such increase.  The Administrative Agent shall have received such other assurances, certificates, documents or opinions as the Administrative Agent reasonably may require, including such assurances, certificates, documents or opinions as may be required to evidence such increase, the validity and enforceability of the Obligations and the validity, perfection and first priority Lien securing the Obligations after giving effect to such increase.  The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to    
  
   74 

Section 3.05  ) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Revolving Credit Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments under this     Section 2.16  .  ] 
  [  (f)      Conflicting Provisions  .  This     Section 2.16     shall supersede any provisions in     Sections 2.13     or     11.01     to the contrary.  ]

  (i)        Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws.  If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party, then the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
  (ii)        If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 3.01  ) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction has been made. 
  (iii)        If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) such  
  
   75

(1)    Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section 3.01  ) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to   Section 3.01(c)(ii)(x)   or   Section 3.01(c)(ii)(y)   below. 
  (i)        Each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that, any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 11.06(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the  
  
   76 

Administrative Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party, as applicable, under this   clause (ii)  . 
  (d)        Evidence of Payments  .  Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party     or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this   Section 3.01  , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 
  (e)        Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation  . 
  (i)        Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower     and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in   Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A)  ,   (ii)(B)   and   (ii)(D)   below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  (ii)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, 
  
   77 

(A)        any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower     and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  (B)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent  it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower     and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (I)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (II)        executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI, 
  (III)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit F-1   to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a    U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate   ) and (y) executed originals of  IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or 
  (IV)        to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit F-2   or   Exhibit F-3  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct  
  
   78 

or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit F-4   on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner. 
  (C)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)        if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower     and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower     or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  (iii)        Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this   Section 3.01   expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (f)        Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  If any Recipient, in its sole discretion, determines in good faith that it has received a refund  
  
   79 

of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 3.01  , it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this   Section 3.01   with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. 
  (g)        Survival  .  Each party s obligations under this   Section 3.01   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
  3.02        Illegality  .  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars), or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or Canadian Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or change interest with respect to or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or the CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate (as applicable), the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans (as applicable) of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or  
  
   80 

the CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate (as applicable), in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as applicable (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or the CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate (as applicable)), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate or Canadian Base Rate (as applicable) applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate (as applicable) until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
  3.03        Inability to Determine Rates  .  If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) deposits (whether in Dollars or Canadian Dollars) are not being offered to banks in the applicable interbank eurodollar market for such currency the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or Canadian Dollars) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to   clause (a)(i)   above,    Impacted Loans   ), or (iii) a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to Canadian Dollars (including, without limitation, changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls), or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders     determine that for any reason the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate or the CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate, the utilization  
  
   81 

of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate or the CDOR Rate component of the Canadian Prime Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Base Rate Loan in Dollars or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan in Canadian Dollars (as applicable) in the amount specified therein. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination in   clause (a)(i)   of this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (A) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under   clause (a)   of the first sentence of this Section, (B) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (C) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
  3.04        Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans  . 
  (a)        Increased Costs Generally  .  If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve   requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate   or the L/C Issuer; 
  (ii)        subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in   clauses (b)   through   (d)   of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  
   82 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate or the CDOR Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        Capital Requirements  .  If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement  .  A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)        Delay in Requests  .  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the  
  
   83 

L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  (e)        Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans  .  The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as  Eurocurrency liabilities ), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,   provided   the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days  prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice. 
  3.05        Compensation for Losses  .  Within ten (10) Business Days of a demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
  (a)         any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
  (b)        any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
  (c)        any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to   Section 11.13  ; or 
  (d)        any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or interest due thereon) denominated in Canadian Dollars on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; 
  including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract.  The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
  
   84 

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this   Section 3.05  , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank eurodollar market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 
  3.06        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  . 
  (a)        Designation of a Different Lending Office  .  Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 3.04  , or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 3.01  , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to   Section 3.02  , then such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 3.01   or   3.04  , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to   Section 3.02  , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  (b)        Replacement of Lenders  .  If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 3.04  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 3.01   and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with   Section 3.06(a)  , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with   Section 11.13  . 
  3.07        Survival  .  All of the Borrower s obligations under this   Article III   shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent. 
  ARTICLE IV          CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO EFFECTIVENESS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 
  4.01        Conditions to Effectiveness on the Closing Date  .  The amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement pursuant hereto shall become effective on and as of the date on

Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Article IX   to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. 
  ARTICLE X          CONTINUING GUARANTY 
  10.01        Guaranty  .  Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrower to the Secured Parties, arising hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, any Secured Cash Management Agreement or any Secured Hedge Agreement (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys  fees and expenses incurred by the Secured Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof).  The Administrative Agent s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive absent manifest error for the purpose of establishing  
  
   131 

the amount of the Obligations.  This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 
  10.02        Rights of Lenders  .  Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Secured Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Obligations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor. 
  10.03        Certain Waivers  .  Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Secured Party) of the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor s liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.  Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations  .    Each Guarantor waives any rights and defenses that are or may become available to such Guarantor by reason of    2787 to 2855, inclusive, and    2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code.  As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.  The foregoing waivers and the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Guaranty which pertain  
  
   132 

to California law are included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or the Obligations. 
  10.04        Obligations Independent  .  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against such Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 
  10.05        Subrogation  .  No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Secured Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
  10.06        Termination; Reinstatement  .  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Obligations are terminated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any of the Secured Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Secured Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Secured Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of each Guarantor under the preceding sentence shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
  10.07        Subordination  .  Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Borrower owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of the Secured Parties or resulting from such Guarantor s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations.  If the Secured Parties so request, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Borrower to any Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by any Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Parties and the proceeds thereof shall be paid  
  
   133 

over to the Secured Parties on account of the Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantors under this Guaranty. 
  10.08        Stay of Acceleration  .  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by such Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Secured Parties. 
  10.09        Condition of Borrower  .  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Secured Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Secured Parties at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other Guarantor (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same). 
  10.10        Contribution  .  To the extent any Guarantor makes a payment hereunder in excess of the aggregate amount of the benefit received by such Guarantor in respect of the extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement (the    Benefit Amount   ), then such Guarantor, after the payment in full, in cash, of all of the Obligations, shall be entitled to recover from each other Guarantor of the Obligations such excess payment, pro rata, in accordance with the ratio of the Benefit Amount received by each such other Guarantor to the total Benefit Amount received by all Guarantors, and the right to such recovery shall be deemed to be an asset and property of such Guarantor so funding; provided, that all such rights to recovery shall be subordinated and junior in right of payment, without any limitation as to the increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior final and indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations and, in the event of the application of any Debtor Relief Laws relating to any Guarantor, its debts or assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Guarantor therefor. 
  10.11        Concerning Joint and Several Liability of the Guarantors  .  In addition to and not in limitation of the provisions set forth herein, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees to the following: 
  (a)        The obligations of each Guarantor under the provisions of this Guaranty constitute full recourse obligations of each Guarantor enforceable against each such Guarantor to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Documents or any other agreement or document relating to the Obligations or any other circumstance whatsoever. 
  
   134 

(b)        Until all Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and all of the lending and other credit commitments under this Agreement and Loan Documents have been terminated, the Guarantors will not, and will not cause or permit any of their Subsidiaries to, commence or join with any other creditor or creditors of any of their Subsidiaries in commencing the application of any Debtor Relief Laws against any of their Subsidiaries. 
  10.12        Guarantors  Agreement to Pay Enforcement Costs, etc  .  Each Guarantor further jointly and severally agrees, as a principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, all costs and expenses set forth in   Section 11.04  .  The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. 
  10.13        Keepwell  .  Each Loan Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Guaranty or the grant of the security interest hereunder, in each case, by any Specified Loan Party, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Loan Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Loan Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor s obligations and undertakings under this   Section 10.13   voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this   Section 10.13   shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends this   Section 10.13   to constitute, and this   Section 10.13   shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a  keepwell, support, or other agreement  for the benefit of, each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)        Limitations upon Participant Rights  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 3.01   or   3.04     than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.01   unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with   Section 3.01(e)   as though it were a Lender. 
  (f)        Certain Pledges  .

  (c)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 3.04   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 3.01  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 
  (d)        such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

  Dear Victor, 
    
  We are pleased to offer you the position of Chief Operations Officer with Noodles   Company. This offer is contingent upon your successful completion of a background check. Below are the details of your new position: 

Your title is Chief Operations Officer. 
                
    You will report to Kevin Reddy, CEO and Chairman of the Board. 
                
    Your base pay will be $325,000 on an annual basis, paid bi-weekly less payroll deductions and all required withholdings. 
                
    You will also receive an initial grant of 35,000 nonqualified stock options and 9,000 RSUs, under the Company s Stock Option Plan, based on the approval of the compensation committee of Noodles   Company Board of Directors.  The grant shall have a 4-year level vesting period. 
                
    Noodles   Company has agreed to provide you with a sign-on bonus of $50,000.00. Please review and sign the terms and conditions contained in Noodles   Company s Cash Advance Agreement, which includes an 18-month payback clause. 
                
    You will be reimbursed for actual COBRA premium payments prior to enrolling in the Noodles and Company benefits plan, which will go into effect September 1  st  , 2016, based on your start date. 
                
    You will be eligible to be considered for an annual merit review for fiscal year 2016 so long as you remain employed with Noodles   Company. The review might lead to an increase in your compensation, and is tied to your annual performance review and performance criteria. 
                
    You will be eligible to participate in the 2016 Company Bonus Program depending on both the company s and your performance. Your bonus target is 50% of your annual salary. You must be actively employed by Noodles   Company at the time the bonus is paid out. The terms and conditions of the bonus plan may vary from year to year. 
                
    Noodles   Company offers a variety of benefits for you, your spouse or domestic partner, and your family. Please refer to the 2016-2017 Employee Benefits Summary included with this letter for additional information. You will be able to enroll for your benefits online 48 hours after your start date.

Employee health premiums are deducted from each bi-weekly paycheck on a pre-tax basis.    Please note the deadline for benefits enrollment is 30 days from your benefits effective date. 
                
    You will be eligible for a monthly car allowance of $600/month along with normal expense reimbursement for your travel. 
                
    You will accrue 25 days of PTO annually. 

In regards to relocation, our primary focus is your ability to have impact and get results. If you are able to do this and do it well, while not living in Denver, then there would be no need to move in your current role. If there was a promotional opportunity, a relocation to the Denver area would be expected. At that time, we would offer an appropriate relocation package based on market conditions and level of position being promoted to within the organization. 
       
  Noodles   Company maintains that all employment offers are contingent upon the successful results of the background check. You understand that the terms of this letter do not imply employment for a specific period. Your employment is at will; either you or the Company can terminate it at any time, with or without cause. The Company reserves the right to amend the bonus and benefits plans as necessary. 
    
  We look forward to having you join us in what we expect will be a mutually rewarding relationship and great career move for you.  If you have questions, please contact me at 303.710.5955. 

Sincerely,
