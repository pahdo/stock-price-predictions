INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING DISCLOSURE 

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Statements in this report that are not historical facts, including statements about management s beliefs and expectations, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and are subject to change based on a number of factors, including those outlined under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and any updated risk factors we include in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. 

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

risks arising from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including material weaknesses in our control environment; 

our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients; 

our ability to retain and attract key employees; 

risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our critical accounting estimates; 

potential adverse effects if we are required to recognize impairment charges or other adverse accounting-related developments; 

potential downgrades in the credit ratings of our securities; 

risks associated with the effects of global, national and regional economic and political conditions, including fluctuations in economic growth rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; and 

developments from changes in the regulatory and legal environment for advertising and marketing and communications services companies around the world. 

Investors should carefully consider these factors and the additional risk factors outlined in more detail under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

September 30, 2014 

(Unaudited) 

NOTE A   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2005 under the name Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. ( Blue Ribbon ). Blue Ribbon changed its name to Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. ("Classic Rules") on July 15, 2008. Classic Rules formed a subsidiary in the State of Connecticut on August 13, 2008 named Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. to develop an annual judo championship tournament. Collectively the entities are referred to as  the Company . On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company currently operates in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2014, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted for interim financial statement presentation and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statement presentation. They should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to fairly present the financial position as of September 30, 2014 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

NOTE B   GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2014, the Company had a working capital deficit of $23,114 and accumulated deficit of $311,178. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The Company needs to raise additional capital in order to fully develop its business plan. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurance that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and adequate cash flows from operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited) 

NOTE E   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

During the third quarter of 2014, the Company identified fraudulent activities entered into by its former CEO who is also a former member of the Board of Directors. The former officer and director of the Company entered into certain employment agreements and convertible notes payable without the proper authorization of the Company or other members of its Board of Directors. The employment agreements and convertible notes payable were entered into during the three months ended June 30, 2014. The Company assessed its potential responsibility for these liabilities entered into and determined it to be remote due to the former officer not having received approval from the Company board of directors to enter into such transactions and the employment agreements and notes being entered into through a fictitious entity with which the Company has no previous or current affiliation with. As such, the impacts of these agreements are not reflected in these financial statements. 

NOTE F   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On June 24, 2014, the Company entered into a 12-month public relations agreement with Affinity Mediaworks Corp. (OTCBB: AFFW). Under the terms of the agreement the Company shall produce up to four shareholder events during the term of the agreement, that encapsulates the current and proposed status of Affinity Mediaworks. The shareholder events shall include an A-List Entertainer as the Key-Note Speaker and at least three additional A-List entertainers that mingle during the event. The Company shall also use Affinity Mediaworks as a platinum sponsor for unrelated Company functions. The Company agreed to the acceptance of 2,000,000 shares of Affinity Mediaworks Corp. common stock as payment for services. 

On August 15, 2014, the Company and Affinity Mediaworks Corp. mutually agreed to terminate the services agreement discussed in Note E. Payment, by way of common stock, was not received from Affinity Mediaworks Corp. nor were services performed by the Company. 

On June 3, 2015, the Company amended the designation of the Series A Preferred Stock and converted the outstanding 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to 200,000 shares of common stock and cancelled the Series A Preferred Stock.    

On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby it will issue up to 50,000,000 shares of restricted common stock for $0.01 cash per share representing total cash proceeds of up to $500,000. On the same date, the Company issued 50,000,000 common shares and recorded a subscription receivable for $500,000 of which $30,000 was received on June 2, 2015. 

In November 2015, certain shareholders of the Company expressed dissatisfaction. While no legal action was taken by the shareholders, the Company deemed it was in its best interest to settle with the shareholders by issuing a total of 165,480 shares of common stock. 

Additionally, on November 4, 2015, the Company issued a total of 34,520 shares of common stock for professional services performed related to settling with the dissatisfied shareholders.

Forward-looking Information 

This Form 10-Q quarterly report includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q that address activities, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy and measures to implement strategy, competitive strength, goals, expansion and growth of our business and operations, plans, references to future success, reference to intentions as to future matters, and other such matters are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue," or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013  

Revenues  .  The Company had no revenue during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2014 or 2013. 

Cost of Revenues . The Company had no cost of revenue for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2014 or 2013. 

General and Administrative expenses . The Company incurred $12,646 in general and administrative expenses during the three month period ended September 30, 2014 as compared to $3,848 in general and administrative expenses for the comparable period in 2013. Additionally, the Company incurred $183,123 of such expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $16,727 during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase is a result of increased professional fees associated with catching up delinquent filings with the SEC and stock based compensation totaling $148,962 during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 that was not present during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. 

Loss From Operations . The Company incurred an operating loss of $12,646 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $3,848 during the same period in 2013. Additionally, the Company incurred an operating loss of $183,123 during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $4,177 during the same period in 2013. The increase in net operating losses is due to increases in general and administrative expenses as explained above.

The net other income of $12,550 during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was from the forgiveness of $12,550 of accounts payable which we do not expect to occur in the future. 

Net Loss . The Company incurred net losses of $12,646 and $183,123 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $3,848 and $4,177 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013.

As of September 30, 2014, the Company was primarily relying on its corporate officers, directors, and outside investors for the funding needed for the implementation of its business plan. The Company s management is currently looking for the capital needed to complete its corporate objectives. The Company cannot predict the extent to which its liquidity and capital resources will be available prior to executing its business plan or whether it will have sufficient capital to fund typical operating expenses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term "disclosure controls and procedures" to mean a company's controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its chief executive and chief financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. 

Management's Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company's internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2014, based upon the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2014, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses at September 30, 2014: 

13 

As of September 30, 2014, there was a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) in the US and the financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

As of September 30, 2014, there were insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

As of September 30, 2014, there was a lack of segregation of duties, in that we had only one person performing all accounting-related duties. 

As of September 30, 2014, there were no independent directors and no independent audit committee. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting involving the preparation and reporting of our financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP, were not effective. 

We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls is a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when practical and necessary. 

This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this quarterly report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be part of the ordinary course of our business. At present, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company s property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings. 

Item 1A.     Risk Factors 

An investment in our shares is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Therefore, you should not invest in our shares unless you are able to bear a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the following factors as well as those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the other information contained herein before deciding to invest in our shares. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections include the risks and uncertainties relating to our business described above. The fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to our past filings, means only that the risks are present in multiple periods. We believe that many of the risks detailed here and in our SEC filings are part of doing business in our industry and will likely be present in all periods reported. The fact that certain risks are endemic to our industry does not lessen the significance of the risk. We urge you to carefully consider the following discussion of risks as well as other information regarding our common stock. This report and statements that we may make from time to time may contain forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections. 

Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.
