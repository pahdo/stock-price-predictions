AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1. Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of AGNC Investment Corp. (referred throughout this report as the "Company", "we", "us" and "our") are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form   10-Q   and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary.  Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period have been included.  The current period s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year.  

Note 2  . Organization 
  We were organized in Delaware on January 7, 2008, and commenced operations on May 20, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering ("IPO"). Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "AGNC." 
  We operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").  As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually   90%   of our taxable net income.  As long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable net income to the extent that we distribute our annual taxable net income to our stockholders on a timely basis.  It is our intention to distribute   100%   of our taxable net income, after application of available tax attributes, within the limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.    
  We invest primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities ("agency MBS") on a leveraged basis.  These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") (collectively referred to as "GSEs").  We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related securities, such as credit risk transfer ("CRT") securities and non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency.  
  Our principal objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of monthly dividends and net asset value (also referred to as "net book value," "NAV" and "stockholders' equity") accretion.  We generate income from the interest earned on our investment assets, net of associated borrowing and hedging activities, and net realized gains and losses on our investments and hedging activities.  We fund our investments primarily through short-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements.  
  Prior to July 1, 2016, we were externally managed by AGNC Management, LLC, (formerly known as American Capital AGNC Management, LLC) (our "Manager").  On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding membership interests of AGNC Mortgage Management, LLC ("AMM," formerly known as American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC ), the parent company of our Manager, from American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM"), a wholly owned portfolio company of American Capital, Ltd. ("ACAS").  AMM is also the parent company of MTGE Management, LLC ("MTGE Manager," formerly known as American Capital MTGE Management, LLC), the external manager of MTGE Investment Corp. ("MTGE," formerly known as American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.).  Following the closing of the acquisition of AMM, we became internally managed and are no longer affiliated with ACAS. (See Note 10 for further details.)

Note 3  . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Investment Securities 
  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 320,   Investments Debt and Equity Securities   ("ASC 320"), requires that at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity. Securities classified as trading and available-for-sale are reported at fair value, while securities classified as held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost.  We may sell any of our securities as part of our overall management of our investment portfolio.  Accordingly, we typically designate our investment securities as available-for-sale, unless we have elected the fair value option for such securities under ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments  .  All securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI"), a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Upon the sale of a security designated as available-for-sale, we determine the cost of the security and the amount of unrealized gains or losses to reclassify out of accumulated OCI into earnings based on the specific identification method.   
  If we designate a security as trading or if we elect the fair value option for a security, changes in the fair value of such security are reflected in net income through other gain (loss) during the period in which they occur.  We have elected the fair value option to account for CRT securities, interest-only securities and inverse interest-only securities (together referred to as "interest-only securities") and principal-only securities as this election simplifies the accounting for such securities.  
  CRT securities are risk sharing instruments issued by the GSEs, and similarly structured transactions issued by third party market participants, that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third parties to private investors.  Unlike agency MBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency; rather, "credit risk transfer" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT securities if credit losses on a related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds.  By reducing the amount that they are obligated to repay to holders of CRT securities, the GSEs and/or other third parties are able to offset credit losses on the related loans.  
  Non-agency MBS are backed by residential or commercial mortgage loans packaged and securitized by a private institution, such as a commercial bank.  Non-agency MBS typically benefit from credit enhancements derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance, but nonetheless carry a higher level of credit exposure than agency MBS.  
  Interest-only securities represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest flows of specific agency CMO securities. Principal-only securities represent the right to receive the contractual principal flows of specific agency CMO securities. Our investments in interest and principal-only securities are included in agency securities, at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  REIT equity securities represent investments in the common stock of other publicly traded mortgage REITs that invest predominantly in agency MBS. We designate our investments in REIT equity securities as trading securities and report them at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  We estimate the fair value of agency and non-agency MBS and CRT securities based on a market approach using "Level 2" inputs from third-party pricing services and non-binding dealer quotes derived from common market pricing methods.  Such methods incorporate, but are not limited to, reported trades and executable bid and asked prices for similar securities, benchmark interest rate curves, such as the spread to the U.S. Treasury rate and interest rate swap curves, convexity, duration and the underlying characteristics of the particular security, including coupon, periodic and life caps, rate reset period, issuer, additional credit support and expected life of the security.  We estimate the fair value of our REIT equity securities based on a market approach using "Level 1" inputs based on quoted market prices.  Refer to Note 8 for further discussion of fair value measurements. 
  We evaluate our investments designated as available-for-sale for other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") on at least a quarterly basis.  The determination of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired may involve judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors.  When a security is impaired, an OTTI is considered to have occurred if any one of the following three conditions exists as of the financial reporting date: (i) we intend to sell the security (that is, a decision has been made to sell the security), (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or (iii) we do not expect to recover the security's amortized cost basis, even if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security.  A general allowance for unidentified impairments in a portfolio of securities is not permitted.

Interest Income 
  Interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms. Premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of agency and non-agency MBS are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the effective interest method in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-20,   Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs   ("ASC 310-20"). 
  We estimate long-term prepayment speeds of our mortgage securities using a third-party service and market data. The third-party service estimates prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve, current mortgage rates and mortgage rates of the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. We review the prepayment speeds estimated by the third-party service and compare the results to market consensus prepayment speeds, if available. We also consider historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions to validate the reasonableness of the prepayment speeds estimated by the third-party service and, based on our judgment, we may make adjustments to its estimates.  Actual and anticipated prepayment experience is reviewed quarterly and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between (i) our previously estimated future prepayments and (ii) the actual prepayments to date plus our currently estimated future prepayments.  If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments, we are required to record an adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts for the cumulative difference in the effective yield through the reporting date. 
    
  At the time we purchase CRT securities, we determine an effective yield based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future cash flows and our cost basis.  Our initial cash flow estimates for these investments are based on our observations of current information and events and include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates and the impact of default and severity rates on the timing and amount of credit losses.  On at least a quarterly basis, we review the estimated cash flows and make appropriate adjustments, based on inputs and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment as adjusted for credit impairment, if any. 
  Derivative Instruments 
  We use a variety of derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and liquidity risk.  The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios.  In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates.  The principal instruments that we use are interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps ("swaptions").  We also utilize U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts, primarily through short sales, and forward contracts for the purchase or sale of agency MBS securities on a generic pool basis in the "to-be-announced" market ("TBA securities") and on a specified pool basis.  We may also purchase or write put or call options on TBA securities and invest in mortgage and other types of derivatives, such as interest and principal-only securities. 
  We also enter into TBA contracts as a means of investing in and financing agency securities (thereby increasing our "at risk" leverage) or as a means of disposing of or reducing our exposure to agency securities (thereby reducing our "at risk" leverage).  Under TBA contracts, we agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, agency securities with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular agency securities to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date.  We may also choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting short or long position (referred to as a "pair off"), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing or selling a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date.  This transaction is commonly referred to as a "dollar roll."  The agency securities purchased or sold for a forward settlement date are typically priced at a discount to agency securities for settlement in the current month.  This difference (or discount) is referred to as the "price drop."  The price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency securities over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost) and is commonly referred to as "dollar roll income/loss."  Consequently, forward purchases of agency securities and dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing.   
  We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging   ("ASC 815").  ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value.   
  Our derivative agreements generally contain provisions that allow for netting or setting off derivative assets and liabilities with the counterparty; however, we report related assets and liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.  Derivative instruments in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivative instruments in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in fair value of derivative instruments and periodic settlements related to our derivative instruments are recorded in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in  
  
    8 

our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Cash receipts and payments related to derivative instruments are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows according to the underlying nature or purpose of the derivative transaction, generally in the investing section. 
  The use of derivative instruments creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. We attempt to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings, monitoring positions with individual counterparties and adjusting posted collateral as required.  
  Discontinuation of hedge accounting for interest rate swap agreements 
  Prior to fiscal year 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements typically with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting under ASC 815.  However, during fiscal year 2011, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps.  Upon discontinuation of hedge accounting, the net deferred loss related to our de-designated interest rate swaps remained in accumulated OCI and is being reclassified from accumulated OCI into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each interest rate swap through October 2016.   
  Interest rate swap agreements 
  We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with borrowings made under our repurchase agreement facilities.  Under our interest rate swap agreements, we typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on one, three or six-month LIBOR ("payer swaps") with terms up to 20 years.  The floating rate we receive under our swap agreements has the effect of offsetting the repricing characteristics of our repurchase agreements and cash flows on such liabilities.  Our swap agreements are privately negotiated in the over the counter ("OTC") market, with swap agreements entered into subsequent to May 2013 subject to central clearing through a registered commodities exchange ("centrally cleared swaps"). 
  We estimate the fair value of our centrally cleared interest rate swaps using the daily settlement price determined by the respective exchange.  Centrally cleared swaps are valued by the exchange using a pricing model that references the underlying rates including the overnight index swap rate and LIBOR forward rate to produce the daily settlement price.  
  We estimate the fair value of our "non-centrally cleared" swaps using a combination of inputs from counterparty and third-party pricing models to estimate the net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the end of the measurement period.  We also incorporate both our own and our counterparties' nonperformance risk in estimating the fair value of our interest rate swaps.  In considering the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and credit enhancements, such as collateral postings and guarantees, and have concluded that our own and our counterparty risk is not significant to the overall valuation of these agreements.   
  Interest rate swaptions 
  We purchase interest rate swaptions generally to help mitigate the potential impact of larger, more rapid changes in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio.  Interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future.  Our swaption agreements typically provide us the option to enter into a pay fixed rate interest rate swap, which we refer as "payer swaptions."  We may also enter into swaption agreements that provide us the option to enter into a receive fixed interest rate swap, which we refer to as "receiver swaptions."  The premium paid for interest rate swaptions is reported as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets. The premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the swaption that would have the effect of closing the position adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. The difference between the premium and the fair value of the swaption is reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  If a swaption expires unexercised, the realized loss on the swaption would be equal to the premium paid.  If we sell or exercise a swaption, the realized gain or loss on the swaption would be equal to the difference between the cash or the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap received and the premium paid. 
  Our interest rate swaption agreements are privately negotiated in the OTC market and are not subject to central clearing.  We estimate the fair value of interest rate swaptions using a combination of inputs from counterparty and third-party pricing models based on the fair value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option, adjusted for non-performance risk, if any. 
  TBA securities 
  A TBA security is a forward contract for the purchase ("long position") or sale ("short position") of agency MBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date.  The specific agency MBS delivered into the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets  
  
    9 

Association, are not known at the time of the transaction.   We may enter into TBA contracts as a means of hedging against short-term changes in interest rates.  We may also enter into TBA contracts as a means of acquiring or disposing of agency securities and utilize TBA dollar roll transactions to finance agency MBS purchases.  
  We account for TBA contracts as derivative instruments since either the TBA contracts do not settle in the shortest period of time possible or we cannot assert that it is probable at inception and throughout the term of the TBA contract that we will take physical delivery of the agency security upon settlement of the contract.  We account for TBA dollar roll transactions as a series of derivative transactions. Gains, losses and dollar roll income associated with our TBA contracts and dollar roll transactions are recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net. 
  We estimate the fair value of TBA securities based on similar methods used to value our agency MBS securities. 
  U.S. Treasury securities 
  We purchase or sell short U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts to help mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our portfolio. We borrow securities to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities under reverse repurchase agreements. We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date.  Gains and losses associated with purchases and short sales of U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts are recognized in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net 
  Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet.  Acquired intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate asset are included in goodwill, which represents the estimated future economic benefit arising from these assets.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually.  Intangible assets meeting the criteria for recognition as separate assets are recorded at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition.  Intangible assets with an estimated useful life are amortized over their expected useful life.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $526 million   of goodwill and   $29 million   of other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, reported in goodwill and other intangible assets, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to our acquisition of AMM on July 1, 2016 (see   Note 10   for further details).   
  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods when events or circumstances may make it more likely than not that an impairment has occurred.  If a qualitative analysis indicates that there may be an impairment, a quantitative analysis is performed.  The quantitative impairment test for goodwill utilizes a two-step approach whereby we compare the carrying value of each identified reporting unit to its fair value.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value.  An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value.   

Note 4  . Investment Securities 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment portfolio consisted of   $47.4 billion   and   $52.5 billion   of investment securities, at fair value, respectively, and a   $15.6 billion   and   $7.4 billion   net long TBA position, at fair value, respectively.  
  Our TBA position is reported at its net carrying value of   $46 million   and   $14 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in derivative assets/(liabilities) on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The net carrying value of our TBA position represents the difference between the fair value of the underlying agency security in the TBA contract and the cost basis or the forward price to be paid or received for the underlying agency security. (See   Note 6   for further details of our net TBA position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .) 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net unamortized premium balance on our MBS was   $2.1 billion   and   $2.3 billion  , respectively, including interest and principal-only securities.

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our investments in non-agency MBS carried a credit rating of AAA.  As of September 30, 2016, all of our investments in CRT securities were issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. 
    
  The actual maturities of our investment securities are generally shorter than their stated contractual maturities.  Actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgages, periodic contractual principal payments and principal prepayments.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our weighted average expected constant prepayment rate ("CPR") over the remaining life of our aggregate investment portfolio was   11%   and   8%  , respectively.  Our estimates differ materially for different types of securities and thus individual holdings have a wide range of projected CPRs.  
    
  The following table summarizes our investments classified as available-for-sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   according to their estimated weighted average life classification (dollars in millions):

The following table presents the gross unrealized loss and fair values of our available-for-sale securities by length of time that such securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions):  

We did not recognize any OTTI charges on our investment securities   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As of the end of each respective reporting period, a decision had not been made to sell any of our securities in an unrealized loss position and we did not believe it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.  The unrealized losses on our securities were not due to credit losses given the GSE guarantees and credit enhancements on our non-agency securities, but rather were due to changes in interest rates and prepayment expectations.  However, as we continue to actively manage our portfolio, we may recognize additional realized losses on our investment securities upon selecting specific securities to sell.  
  Gains and Losses on Sale of Mortgage-Backed Securities 
  The following table is a summary of our net gain (loss) from the sale of securities classified as available-for-sale   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions).  Please refer to   Note 9   for a summary of changes in accumulated OCI for the same periods  .     

________________________ 
           1. 
    Proceeds include cash received during the period, plus receivable for MBS sold during the period as of period end. 
     For   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized a net unrealized loss of   $6 million   and an unrealized gain of   $5 million  , respectively, and for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   we recognized a net unrealized gain of   $10 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, for the change in value of investments in interest and principal-only securities in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Over the same periods, we did not recognize any realized gains or losses on our interest or principal-only securities.  
  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held investments in CMO trusts, which are variable interest entities ("VIEs").  We have consolidated certain of these CMO trusts in our consolidated financial statements where we have determined we are the primary beneficiary of the trusts.  All of our CMO securities are backed by fixed or adjustable-rate agency MBS.  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guarantees the payment of interest and principal and acts as the trustee and administrator of their respective securitization trusts.  Accordingly, we are not required to provide the beneficial interest holders of the CMO securities any financial or other support.  Our maximum exposure to loss related to our involvement with CMO trusts is the fair value of the CMO securities and interest and principal-only securities held by us, less principal amounts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.   
   In connection with our consolidated CMO trusts, we recognized agency securities with a total fair value of   $0.9 billion   and   $1.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and debt with a total fair value of   $494 million   and   $595 million  , respectively, in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the agency securities had an aggregate unpaid principal balance of   $0.8 billion   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively, and the debt had an  
  
    13 

aggregate unpaid principal balance of   $488 million   and   $587 million  , respectively.  We re-measure our consolidated debt at fair value through earnings in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  For   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded a loss of   $2 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, associated with our consolidated debt.  For   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a gain of   $7 million   and   $16 million  , respectively, associated with our consolidated debt.  Our involvement with the consolidated trusts is limited to the agency securities transferred by us upon the formation of the trusts and the CMO securities subsequently held by us.  There are no arrangements that could require us to provide financial support to the trusts.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of our CMO securities and interest and principal-only securities was   $1.2 billion   and   $1.3 billion  , respectively, excluding the consolidated CMO trusts discussed above, or   $1.6 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively, including the net asset value of our consolidated CMO trusts.  Our maximum exposure to loss related to our CMO securities and interest and principal-only securities, including our consolidated CMO trusts, was   $222 million   and   $238 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 5  . Repurchase Agreements and Other Secured Borrowings  
  We pledge certain of our securities as collateral under our repurchase agreements with financial institutions and under our secured borrowing facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines.  Interest rates on our borrowings are generally based on LIBOR plus or minus a margin and amounts available to be borrowed are dependent upon the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, type of security and liquidity conditions within the banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries.  If the fair value of our pledged securities declines, lenders will typically require us to post additional collateral or pay down borrowings to re-establish agreed upon collateral requirements, referred to as "margin calls."  Similarly, if the fair value of our pledged securities increases, lenders may release collateral back to us.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had met all margin call requirements.  For additional information regarding our pledged assets, please refer to   Note 7  .   
  Repurchase Agreements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $37.7 billion   and   $41.8 billion  , respectively, of repurchase agreements outstanding.  The terms and conditions of our repurchase agreements are typically negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis.  Our repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than 90 days have floating interest rates based on an index plus or minus a fixed spread. Substantially all of our repurchase agreements were used to fund purchases of agency securities ("agency repo").  The remainder of our repurchase agreements were used to fund temporary holdings of U.S. Treasury securities ("U.S. Treasury repo"). 
  The following table summarizes our borrowings under repurchase agreements by their remaining maturities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in millions): 

14 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
    
  On January 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") released its final rule on FHLB membership, which requires the termination of our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary's FHLB membership and repayment of all FHLB advances after a one year period ending in February 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $3.0 billion   and   $3.8 billion  , respectively, of outstanding secured FHLB advances, with a weighted average borrowing rate of   0.63%   and   0.53%  , respectively, and a weighted average remaining term to maturity of   123   and   141   days, respectively, consisting of 30 day and longer-term floating rate advances: 

Debt of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , debt of consolidated VIEs, at fair value, was   $494 million   and   $595 million  , respectively, and had a weighted average interest rate of   LIBOR   plus   39   and   34   basis points, respectively, and a principal balance of   $488 million   and   $587 million  , respectively.  The actual maturities of our debt of consolidated VIEs are generally shorter than the stated contractual maturities.  The actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying agency MBS securitizing the debt of our consolidated VIEs and periodic principal prepayments of such underlying securities.  The estimated weighted average life of the debt of our consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   5.1   and   4.9   years, respectively.  

Note 6  . Derivative and Other Hedging Instruments 
  In connection with our risk management strategy, we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into derivative and other hedging instrument contracts. The principal instruments that we use are interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions and U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts, primarily through short sales.  We may also utilize TBA securities, purchase or write put or call options on TBA securities or invest in mortgage and other types of derivatives, such as interest and principal-only securities.  We also enter into TBA contracts as a means of investing in and financing agency securities (thereby increasing our "at risk" leverage) or as a means of disposing of or reducing our exposure to agency securities (thereby reducing our "at risk" leverage).  Our risk management strategy attempts to manage the overall risk of the portfolio, reduce fluctuations in our net book value and generate additional income distributable to stockholders.  For additional information regarding our derivative instruments and our overall risk management strategy, please refer to the discussion of derivative and other hedging instruments in   Note 3  .  
  Prior to September 30, 2011, our interest rate swaps were typically designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815; however, as of September 30, 2011, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps in order to increase our funding flexibility.  For   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we reclassified   $7 million   and   $38 million  , respectively, and for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015     $24 million   and   $79 million  , respectively, of net deferred losses from accumulated OCI into interest expense related to our de-designated interest rate swaps and recognized an equal, but offsetting, amount in other comprehensive income. Our total net periodic interest costs on our swap portfolio were   $58 million   and   $247 million   for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $131 million   and   $369 million   for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The difference between our total net periodic interest costs on our swap portfolio and the amount recorded in interest expense related to our de-designated hedges is reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (totaling   $51 million   and   $209 million   for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $107 million   and   $290 million   for   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining net deferred loss in accumulated OCI related to de-designated interest rate swaps was   $1 million  .

Note 7  . Pledged Assets 
  Our funding agreements require us to fully collateralize our obligations under the agreements based upon our counterparties' collateral requirements and their determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries.  Our derivative contracts similarly require us to fully collateralize our obligations under such agreements, which will vary over time based on similar factors as well as our counterparties' determination of the value of the derivative contract. We are typically required to post initial collateral upon execution of derivative transactions, such as under our interest rate swap agreements and TBA contracts.  If we breach our collateral requirements, we will be required to fully settle our obligations under the agreements, which could include a forced liquidation of our pledged collateral.  
  Our counterparties also apply a "haircut" to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value and limits the amount we can borrow against our securities.  This haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value.  Our agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual transaction basis.  Additionally, the FHLB of Des Moines may adjust the haircut on our outstanding FHLB advances at any time prior to maturity.  As a condition of our membership in the FHLB of Des Moines, we are also obligated to purchase membership stock in the FHLB based upon the total assets of our wholly-owned captive insurance company and activity-based stock in the FHLB based upon the aggregate amount of advances obtained from the FHLB. 
  Consequently, our funding agreements and derivative contracts expose us to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that our counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such agreements.  We minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered clearinghouses and U.S. government agencies and we monitor our positions with individual counterparties.  In the event of a default by a counterparty we may have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral to such counterparty and may not receive payments provided for under the terms of our derivative agreements.  In the case of centrally cleared instruments, we could be exposed to credit risk if the central clearing agency or a clearing member defaults on its respective obligation to perform under the contract.  However, we believe that the risk is minimal due to the clearing exchanges' initial and daily mark to market margin requirements and clearinghouse guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of a clearing member default. 
  Further, each of our International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreements also contains a cross default provision under which a default under certain of our other indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds causes an event of default under the ISDA Master Agreement.  Threshold amounts vary by lender.  Following an event of default, we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements.  Additionally, under certain of our ISDA Master Agreements, we could be required to settle our obligations under the agreements if we fail to maintain certain minimum stockholders' equity thresholds or our REIT status or if we fail to comply with limits on our leverage up to certain specified levels.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk-related contingent features being triggered was not material to our financial statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements was less than   5%   of our stockholders' equity and our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our interest rate swap and swaption agreements, excluding centrally cleared swaps, was less than   1%   of our stockholders' equity.

Assets Pledged to Counterparties 
  The following tables summarize our assets pledged as collateral under our funding, derivative and prime broker agreements by type, including securities pledged related to securities sold but not yet settled, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

______________________ 
  1.  Includes   $194 million   of retained interests in our consolidated VIEs pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements.    

  ______________________ 
  1.  Includes   $245 million   of retained interests in our consolidated VIEs pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $126 million   and   $150 million  , respectively, of membership and activity-based stock in the FHLB of Des Moines.  FHLB stock is reported at cost, which equals par value, in other assets on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.   FHLB stock can only be redeemed or sold at its par value, and only to the FHLB of Des Moines.  
  The cash and cash equivalents and agency securities pledged as collateral under our derivative agreements are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents and agency securities, at fair value, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.  
  The following table summarizes our securities pledged as collateral under our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances by the remaining maturity of our borrowings, including securities pledged related to sold but not yet settled securities, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions).

   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of our borrowings backed by MBS were due on demand or mature overnight.  
  The table above excludes agency securities transferred to our consolidated VIEs.  Securities transferred to our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle the obligations of each respective VIE.  However, we may pledge our retained interests in our consolidated VIEs as collateral under our repurchase agreements and derivative contracts.  Please refer to Notes   4   and   5   for additional information regarding our consolidated VIEs.  
  Assets Pledged from Counterparties 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had U.S. Treasury securities pledged to us from counterparties as collateral under our reverse repurchase agreements of   $5.4 billion   and   $1.7 billion  , respectively.   U.S Treasury securities received as collateral under our reverse repurchase agreements that we use to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities are accounted for as securities borrowing transactions.  We recognize a corresponding obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date.  
  Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
  Certain of our repurchase agreements and derivative transactions are governed by underlying agreements that generally provide for a right of setoff under master netting arrangements (or similar agreements), including in the event of default or in the event of bankruptcy of either party to the transactions.  Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty and the same maturity date are presented net in our consolidated balance sheets when the terms of the agreements permit netting.  All other assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements are presented on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.  The following tables present information about our assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting arrangements and have either been offset or can potentially be offset on our consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions):

              2. 
    Includes cash and securities pledged / received as collateral, at fair value.  Amounts presented are limited to collateral pledged sufficient to reduce the net amount to zero for individual counterparties, as applicable.  

Note 8  . Fair Value Measurements  
    
  We determine the fair value of our investment securities and debt of consolidated VIEs based upon fair value estimates obtained from multiple third party pricing services and dealers.  In determining fair value, third party pricing sources use various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches.  Factors used by third party sources in estimating the fair value of an instrument may include observable inputs such as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, pricing information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other market data that are current as of the measurement date. The availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument.  Third party pricing sources may also use certain unobservable inputs, such as assumptions of future levels of prepayment, defaults and foreclosures, especially when estimating fair values for securities with lower levels of recent trading activity. We make inquiries of third party pricing sources to understand the significant inputs and assumptions they used to determine their prices.  For further information regarding valuation of our derivative instruments, please refer to the discussion of derivative and other hedging instruments in   Note 3  . 
       
  We review the various third party fair value estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range of third party estimates for each position, comparison to recent trade activity for similar securities, and  
  
    23 

management review for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date. While we do not adjust prices we obtain from third party pricing sources, we will exclude third party prices for securities from our determination of fair value if we determine (based on our validation procedures and our market knowledge and expertise) that the price is significantly different from observable market data would indicate and we cannot obtain an understanding from the third party source as to the significant inputs used to determine the price.  
       
  The validation procedures described above also influence our determination of the appropriate fair value measurement classification.  We utilize a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement.  The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.  A financial instrument's categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  There were   no   transfers between hierarchy levels during   the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The three levels of hierarchy are defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1 Inputs  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 Inputs  Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
                
    Level 3 Inputs  Instruments with primarily unobservable market data that cannot be corroborated. 
      The following table provides a summary of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

We elected the option to account for debt of consolidated VIEs at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings during the period in which they occur, because we believe this election more appropriately reflects our financial position as both the consolidated agency securities and consolidated debt are presented in a consistent manner, at fair value, on our consolidated balance sheets.  We estimate the fair value of the consolidated debt based on the fair value of the MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs, less the fair value of our retained interests, which are based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services and non-binding dealer quotes derived from common market pricing methods using "Level 2" inputs. 
  
    24 

Excluded from the table above are financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, which are presented in our consolidated financial statements at cost.  The cost basis of these instruments is determined to approximate fair value due to their short duration or, in the case of longer-term repo and FHLB advances, due to floating rates of interest based on an index plus or minus a fixed spread which is consistent with fixed spreads demanded in the market.  We estimate the fair value of these instruments using "Level 1" or "Level 2" inputs. 

Note 9  . Stockholders' Equity     
  Preferred Stock 
  Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to designate and issue up to   10.0 million   shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series.  Our Board of Directors has designated   6.9 million   shares as   8.000%   Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") and   8,050   shares as   7.750%   Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred Stock").  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   3.1 million   shares of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.  Our Board of Directors may designate additional series of authorized preferred stock ranking junior to or in parity with the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock or designate additional shares of the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock and authorize the issuance of such shares.  
  In   April 2012  , we completed a public offering in which   6.9 million   shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were sold to the underwriters at a price of   $24.2125   per share for proceeds, net of offering expenses, of   $167 million  .  In   May 2014  , we completed a public offering in which   7.0 million   depositary shares were sold to the underwriters at a price of   $24.2125   per depositary share for proceeds, net of offering expenses, of   $169 million  .  Each depositary share represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock.   
  Our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and rank on parity with each other.  Under certain circumstances upon a change of control, our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are convertible to shares of our common stock.  Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and depository shares underlying our Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except under limited conditions, and are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of   8.000%   and   7.750%   per annum, respectively, of their   $25.00   per share and   $25.00   per depositary share liquidation preference, respectively, before holders of our common stock are entitled to receive any dividends.  Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and depository shares underlying our Series B Preferred Stock are each redeemable at   $25.00   per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) exclusively at our option commencing on   April 5, 2017   and   May 8, 2019  , respectively, or earlier under certain circumstances intended to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of each January, April, July and October.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had declared all required quarterly dividends on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. 
  Common Stock Repurchase Program 
  In October 2012, our Board of Directors adopted a program that provided for stock repurchases, which, as amended, authorized repurchases of our common stock up to   $2 billion   through December 31, 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total remaining amount authorized for repurchases of our common stock was   $0.6 billion  .  In October 2016, our Board of Directors terminated the existing stock repurchase program and replaced it with a new stock repurchase authorization.  Under the new stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase up to   $1 billion   of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2017.  
  Shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market, including through block purchases, or through privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.  Among other factors, we intend to only consider repurchasing shares of our common stock when the purchase price is less than our estimate of our current tangible net asset value per common share.  Generally, when we repurchase our common stock at a discount to our tangible net asset value, the tangible net asset value of our remaining shares of common stock outstanding increases.  In addition, we do not intend to repurchase any shares from directors, officers or other affiliates.  The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares, and all repurchases will be made in accordance with Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases.  
  We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   6.5 million   shares of our common stock at an average repurchase price of   $17.89   per share, including expenses, totaling   $116 million  .  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   we repurchased   2.4 million   and   6.3 million   shares, respectively, of our common stock at an average repurchase price of   $19.08   and   $19.57   per share, respectively, including expenses, totaling   $45 million   and   $124 million  , respectively.

Note 10  . Business Combination - Acquisition of AGNC Mortgage Management, LLC 
  On   July 1, 2016  , we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding membership interests of AMM from ACAM, a wholly owned portfolio company of ACAS, for a purchase price of   $562 million   in cash.  Following the closing of the acquisition, we became internally managed and are no longer affiliated with ACAS.  The results of AMM's operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We believe internalizing our management function will result in lower operating costs as well as provide management fee income from MTGE.  
  Our acquisition of AMM is accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the total purchase price has been allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.  Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired that meet the criteria for separate recognition and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from these and other assets acquired that could not be individually identified or do not qualify for recognition as a separate asset.  A large majority of the acquisition price has been recognized as goodwill, which is attributable to our management agreement that does not qualify for separate recognition.  Goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes over a 15 year amortization period.  We did not recognize a gain or loss associated with the effective settlement of our pre-existing management agreement with our Manager on the acquisition date based on comparable agreements available in the market.  
  The fair values of intangible assets acquired were determined using a market-based measurement under the income approach based on primarily unobservable market data that cannot be corroborated and, thus, represent a level 3 measurement (see Note 8).  The primary market-based inputs include forecasted revenues and expenses, discount rate and corporate income tax rate.    
  The following table summarizes the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in millions).  

We recognized   $9 million   of transaction related costs that were expensed during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  These costs are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  AMM's revenue and net income (loss) included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income from the acquisition date to   September 30, 2016   are   $4 million   and   $(6) million  , respectively, after elimination of AGNC's management fee and other intercompany transactions.  The following table represents our pro forma consolidated revenue and net loss as if AMM had been included in our consolidated results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and for the entire nine months ended   September 30, 2016   (in millions).  Revenue includes interest income and management fee income from MTGE.  Amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting AMM's results to reflect amortization expense that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied on January 1, 2015.  All AGNC management fees and all other actual and pro forma intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the AMM acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015 and may not be indicative of future operating results.

Note 11  . Subsequent Events  
  On   October 12, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a monthly dividend of   $0.18   per common share, which will be paid on   November 8, 2016  , to common stockholders of record as of   October 31, 2016  .

  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  AGNC Investment Corp. ("AGNC," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") was organized on January 7, 2008 and commenced operations on May 20, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering.  Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the symbol "AGNC."  
  We operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").  As such, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable net income.  As long as we qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable net income to the extent that we distribute our annual taxable net income to our stockholders in a timely manner.  It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable net income, after application of available tax attributes, within the limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year. 
  We invest primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities ("agency MBS") on a leveraged basis.  These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") (collectively referred to as "GSEs").  We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related securities, such as credit risk transfer ("CRT") securities and non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, we revised our investment guidelines to permit our acquisition of credit-sensitive assets and subsequently made our first investments in CRT securities.  In our view the GSE's programmatic sales of a significant portion of their credit risk underlying conforming mortgage loans represents an appealing long-term opportunity for AGNC.  Furthermore, we believe that AGNC is particularly well suited to benefit from these assets as a result of our substantial experience with conforming mortgage assets and the correlation between agency prepayments and associated credit exposure. We expect the focus of our credit-sensitive investments to be in CRT or similar securities; however, we will opportunistically invest in other non-agency securities backed by either residential or commercial real estate.    
  Our principal objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of monthly dividends and net asset value (also referred to as "net book value," "NAV" and "stockholders' equity") accretion.  We generate income from the interest earned on our investment assets, net of associated borrowing and hedging activities, and net realized gains and losses on our investments and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through borrowings structured as repurchase agreements ("repo"). 
    
  Our Management Internalization 
    
  On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of AGNC Mortgage Management, LLC ("AMM," formerly known as American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC) from American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM"), a wholly owned portfolio company of American Capital, Ltd. ("ACAS"), for a purchase price of $562 million in cash.  AMM is the parent company of our Manager and of MTGE Management, LLC ("MTGE Manager," formerly known as American Capital MTGE Management, LLC), the external manager of MTGE Investment Corp. ("MTGE," formerly known as American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.).  Following the closing of the acquisition of AMM, we became internally managed and are no longer affiliated with ACAS.  We believe that the acquisition represents an important milestone for the Company, and we expect that it will result in lower operating costs for AGNC and generate management fee income from MTGE.  As of October 31, 2016, we had  
  
    29 

approximately 53 full-time employees, and all of our significant business functions were fully staffed.  As part of the internalization, the Company and AMM entered into a Transition Services Agreement with ACAS and ACAM, pursuant to which ACAS and ACAM will provide certain transition services for a limited period of time following the Internalization. 
    
  Our Investment Strategy 
    
  Our investment strategy is designed to: 

manage an investment portfolio consisting primarily of agency securities with the objective of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns; 
                
    capitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations and return potential in the agency and non-agency securities market;  
                
    manage a wide range of risks including financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risks;  
                
    preserve our net book value;  
                
    provide regular monthly distributions to our stockholders;  
                
    continue to qualify as a REIT; and  
                
    remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act").  
     The size and composition of our investment portfolio depends on investment strategies we implement, the availability of investment capital and overall market conditions, including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage our investment portfolio.  Market conditions are influenced by, among other things, current levels of and expectations for future levels of interest rates, mortgage prepayments, market liquidity, housing prices, unemployment rates, general economic conditions, government participation in the mortgage market and evolving regulations or legal settlements that impact servicing practices or other mortgage related activities. 
  Our Risk Management Strategy  
  We use a variety of strategies to hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and liquidity risk.  Our investment and risk management strategy incorporates the cost of hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a REIT.  Consequently, while we use interest rate swaps and other hedges to attempt to protect our net book value against moves in interest rates, we may not hedge certain interest rate, prepayment or extension risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return relative to our risk/return profile, or the hedging transaction would negatively impact our REIT status.  We also generally do not hedge the credit exposure embedded in our purchases of CRT securities or other non-agency securities.  
  The risk management actions we take may lower our earnings and dividends in the short term to further our objective of maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long term.  In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and as a result may be relatively ineffective for smaller changes in interest rates.  There can also be no certainty that our projections of our exposures to interest rates, prepayments, extension or other risks will be accurate or that our hedging activities will be effective and, therefore, actual results could differ materially.  Furthermore, since our hedging strategies are generally not designed to protect our net book value from spread risk, wider spreads between the market yield on our investment securities and benchmark interests underlying our interest rate hedges will typically cause our net book value to decline and can occur independent of changes in benchmark interest rates.  For further discussion of our market risks and risk management strategy, please refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" under Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Trends and Recent Market Impacts 
  Quarterly Highlights 
  Following the Federal Reserve's (the "Fed") first Federal Funds Rate increase in nearly ten years in December 2015, interest rates across much of the yield curve fell materially during the first quarter of 2016, as concerns regarding global economic weakness dampened the market s expectations with respect to U.S. economic growth, inflation and the pace of monetary policy normalization.  Consistent with this weaker outlook, at its March meeting, the Fed significantly reduced its expectations for future short term interest rate increases and explicitly acknowledged the potential downside risk to the U.S. economy associated with the deteriorating global landscape.  The weaker global growth outlook also led to significant additional easing measures  
  
    30 

by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, with the latter instituting negative interest rates for the first time during the first quarter.  
  Early in the second quarter as the U.S. economy showed signs of improvement, communication from the Fed became decidedly more "hawkish" with respect to its stance on monetary policy.  The Fed s more upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy led the market to believe there was an increased likelihood of additional Fed rate hikes, thus causing interest rates more broadly to rise and retrace some of the rate decline experienced in the first quarter.  This trend was subsequently reversed later in the second quarter, as the combination of weaker economic data in the U.S. and the surprise vote by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union drove interest rates to historically low levels. 
  During the third quarter, both long-term and short-term rates moved somewhat higher, reversing the overall trend of the first half of the year, as the market's expectations regarding a fourth quarter rate hike increased following modest improvements in economic data.  In the aggregate, the 10 year U.S. Treasury rate declined 66 bps to 1.61% over the three quarters ended September 30, 2016.  The 10 year U.S. swap rate declined 73 bps to 1.46% as of September 30, 2016.     
  In addition to absolute changes in interest rates, changes in the aggregate spread differential between the market yield on our agency MBS and the benchmark interest rates underlying our interest rate hedges is also a key driver of fluctuations in our total comprehensive income and our NAV per common share. During the first quarter, modest widening in this differential led to a 2.2% decline in our NAV per common share to $22.09 as of March 31, 2016.  Conversely, a modest tightening in this spread differential during the second and third quarters helped drive a 0.6% and 3.1% increase, respectively, in our NAV per common share to $22.22 as of June 30, 2016 and $22.91 as of September 30, 2016.  Taking into account quarterly dividends of $0.60, $0.60 and $0.56 per common share, our quarterly economic return was 0.4%, 3.3% and 5.6% for the first three quarters, respectively.  (For the estimated impact of changes in interests rates and mortgage spreads on our net book value please refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" under Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.)  
  Funding for agency repo was favorably impacted during the third quarter by the recent implementation of money market reform requirements, which took effect in October of 2016 and caused a sizable reallocation of assets from prime funds to U.S. Government bond money market funds.  This shift of capital to U.S. Government money market funds has been supportive of repo backed by agency MBS, reducing our funding costs relative to LIBOR.  As we receive a floating LIBOR rate on our pay fixed / receive floating interest rate swaps, the resultant decline in the spread between our repo borrowing costs and LIBOR has the effect of lowering our all-in cost of funds on the portion of our debt that we have hedged with pay fixed swaps. 
  The average projected life CPR on our portfolio increased to 10.6% as of September 30, 2016 from 8.4% as of December 31, 2015, as prepayment expectations increased consistent with the overall decline in long-term interest rates.  The actual monthly CPR on our portfolio increased to annualized rate of 16% for September of 2016.  Despite elevated prepayments in September, we expect actual monthly speeds to decline for the remainder of the year as a result of the seasonality of housing turnover and modestly higher primary mortgage rates. 
  Given our view that rates in the U.S. will remain relatively range bound, we adjusted the composition of our hedge portfolio and lowered our hedge ratio to 75% of our funding liabilities and net TBA position as of September 30, 2016, compared to 87% as of December 31, 2015.  Our net "duration gap," which is a measure of the risk due to mismatches that can occur between our assets and liabilities, inclusive of hedges, caused by an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates, also declined from 0.8 years as of December 31, 2015 to a net duration gap of 0.3 years as of the end of the third quarter.  Coupled with attractive investment opportunities in agency MBS, we also chose to increase our "at risk" leverage to an average of 7.1x during the first three quarters of the year, compared to 6.8x as of December 31, 2015 and a low of 6.1x as of June 30, 2015.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, our results of operations discussed below include certain non-GAAP financial information, including "adjusted net interest expense," "net spread and dollar roll income," "net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization," "estimated taxable income" and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information, such as "cost of funds" and "net interest rate spread."   
    
  "Adjusted net interest expense" is measured as interest expense (GAAP measure) adjusted to include other interest rate swap periodic costs. "Net spread and dollar roll income" is measured as (i) net interest income (GAAP measure) adjusted to include other interest rate swap periodic costs, TBA dollar roll income, management fee income and dividends on REIT equity securities  
  
    35 

(referred to as "adjusted net interest and dollar roll income") less (ii) total operating expenses (GAAP measure) adjusted to exclude non-recurring transaction costs (referred to as "adjusted operating expenses").  "Net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization," further excludes retrospective "catch-up" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit due to changes in projected CPR estimates.  
    
  By providing such measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, we believe we give greater transparency into the information used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.  We also believe it is important for users of our financial information to consider information related to our current financial performance without the effects of certain measures that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio performance and operations.   
    
  Specifically, in the case of "adjusted net interest and dollar roll income," we believe the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other gain (loss) in our statement of operations, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic agency MBS using short-term repurchase agreements.  Similarly, we believe that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements in such measure and in "adjusted net interest expense," which are recognized under GAAP in other gain (loss), is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument we use to economically hedge against fluctuations in our borrowing costs and inclusion of all periodic interest rate swap settlement costs is more indicative of our total cost of funds than interest expense alone.  In the case of "net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization," we believe the exclusion of "catch-up" adjustments to premium amortization cost or benefit is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such cost or benefit is more indicative of the current earnings potential of our investment portfolio.  We also believe the exclusion of non-recurring transactions costs reported in general, administrative and other expense under GAAP is meaningful as they represent non-recurring transaction costs associated with our acquisition of AMM and are not representative of ongoing operating costs.  In the case of estimated taxable income, we believe it is meaningful information because it directly relates to the amount of dividends we are required to distribute in order to maintain our REIT qualification status. 
    
  However, because such measures are incomplete measures of our financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, estimated taxable income can include certain information that is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing our income tax returns, which occurs after the end of our fiscal year.

Interest Income and Asset Yield

  The principal elements impacting our interest income are the size of our average investment portfolio and the yield on our investments.  The following is a summary of the estimated impact of each of these elements   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period (in millions):  
  
    38 

The size of our average investment portfolio decreased in par value, compared to the prior year period, by   1%   and   8%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The decline was largely due to a relative shift from investments recognized as securities on our consolidated financial statements to investments in TBA securities recognized as derivative assets / liabilities on our consolidated financial statements.  The size of our investment portfolio was also impacted by share repurchase activity and changes in our "at risk" leverage ratio (see   "Leverage"   below). 
  Our average asset yield differed from the prior year period largely due to fluctuations in "catch-up" premium amortization cost recognized due to changes in our projected CPR estimates.  We recognized "catch-up" premium amortization cost of   $8 million   and   $95 million     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to a cost of   $33 million   and   $15 million   for the prior year period, respectively.  Excluding "catch-up" premium amortization cost, our average asset yield was   2.66%   and   2.70%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, largely unchanged from   2.69%   and   2.70%  , respectively, for the prior year period. 

Leverage     
  Our primary measures of leverage are our "at risk" leverage and our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage ratio.  "At risk" leverage is measured as the sum of our mortgage borrowings (consisting of repurchase agreements used to fund our investment securities ("agency repo"), FHLB advances and debt of consolidated VIEs), net TBA position (at cost) and our net receivable / payable for unsettled investment securities divided by the sum of our total stockholders' equity less the fair value of our investments in REIT equity securities.  Tangible net book value "at risk" leverage includes adjustments to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, related to our acquisition of AMM from stockholders' equity.   
  We include our net TBA position in our measures of leverage because a long TBA position carries similar risks as if we had purchased the underlying MBS assets and funded the purchases with on-balance sheet funding liabilities. Similarly, a short TBA position has substantially the same effect as selling the underlying MBS assets and reducing our on-balance sheet funding commitments. (Refer to   Liquidity and Capital Resources   for further discussion of TBA dollar roll positions).  Repurchase agreements used to fund short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities ("U.S. Treasury repo") are excluded from our measures of leverage due to the temporary and highly liquid nature of these investments. 
  Our total "at risk" leverage was   7.2  x and   6.8  x our stockholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage was   7.7  x our tangible stockholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016  .  The table below presents our average and quarter-end mortgage borrowings, net TBA position and leverage ratios for each of the three month periods listed below (dollars in millions):

    Average "at risk" leverage during the period was calculated by dividing the sum of our daily weighted average mortgage borrowings outstanding and our daily weighted average net TBA position (at cost) during the period by the sum of our average month-end stockholders' equity less our average investment in REIT equity securities for the period.   
              4. 
    Tangible net book value "at risk" leverage includes the components of "at risk" leverage with stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net.   
              5. 
    "At risk" leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount of mortgage borrowings outstanding, net payables and receivables for unsettled agency securities and the cost basis (or contract price) of our net TBA position by the sum of our total stockholders' equity less the fair value of our investment in REIT equity securities at period end.   

Interest Expense and Cost of Funds    
    
  Our interest expense is comprised of interest expense on our mortgage borrowings and the reclassification of accumulated OCI into interest expense related to previously de-designated interest rate swaps.  Our mortgage borrowings primarily consist of repurchase agreements used to finance our agency MBS.  Upon our election to discontinue hedge accounting under GAAP as of September 30, 2011, the net deferred loss related to our de-designated interest rate swaps remained in accumulated OCI and is being reclassified from accumulated OCI into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each interest rate swap through October 2016. 
  Our "adjusted net interest expense," also referred to as our "cost of funds" when stated as a percentage of our mortgage borrowings outstanding, includes periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps reported in gain/loss on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Our cost of funds does not include swap termination fees, forward starting swaps and costs associated with our other supplemental hedges, such as swaptions and U.S. Treasury positions.  Our cost of funds also does not include the implied financing cost/benefit of our net TBA dollar roll position, but includes interest rate swap hedge costs related to our TBA dollar roll funded assets.  Consequently, our cost of funds measured as a percentage of our outstanding mortgage borrowings is higher than if we allocated a portion of our swap hedge costs to our TBA dollar roll funded assets.   
    
  Our average cost of funds declined to   1.32%   of our average mortgage borrowings outstanding for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.70%   for the prior year period, while our average cost of funds for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   1.47%  , compared to   1.45%   for the prior year period.  The table below presents a reconciliation of our interest expense (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to our adjusted net interest expense and cost of funds (non-GAAP financial measures)   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions):

    Percent of our average mortgage borrowings outstanding for the period annualized. 
       
  The principal elements impacting our adjusted net interest expense are the size of our average mortgage borrowings outstanding during the period, the size of our average interest rate swap balance outstanding (excluding forward starting swaps), the average interest rate on our borrowings and the average net pay rate on our pay-fixed receive-floating interest rate swaps.  The following is a summary of the estimated impact of the principal elements impacting the increase in our adjusted net interest expense   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year period (in millions):

    Includes amounts recognized in interest expense and in gain (loss) on derivatives and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change due to interest rate reflects the net impact of the change in the weighted average fixed pay and variable receive rates. 
       
  The average interest rate on our borrowings increased for the current year periods largely due to the Fed Funds rate increase in December of 2015. The size of our average borrowings outstanding increased 3% for the current three month period and decreased 7% for the current nine month period due to shifts in asset composition, adjustments to our leverage ratios and share repurchases.  The size of our interest rate swap portfolio in absolute dollar terms decreased during the current year periods due to changes in the size and composition of our mortgage borrowings and net TBA position outstanding and hedge repositioning.  The decline in the average net pay rate on our pay-fixed receive-floating interest rate swaps was a function of both a lower average pay-fixed rate and a higher average receive-floating rate.   
    
  The table below presents a summary of our average mortgage borrowings and our average interest rates swaps outstanding, excluding forward starting swaps,   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions):   

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had an average balance of   $4.4 billion   and   $5.8 billion  , respectively, of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding, compared to   $9.1 billion   and   $10.8 billion  , respectively, for the prior year period.  Forward starting interest rate swaps do not impact our adjusted net interest expense and cost of funds until they commence accruing net interest settlements on their forward start dates.  We enter into forward starting interest rate swaps based on a variety of factors, including our view of the forward yield curve and the timing of potential changes in short-term interest rates, time to deploy new capital, amount and timing of expirations of our existing interest rate swap portfolio, current and anticipated swap spreads and our desire to mitigate our exposure to specific sectors of the yield curve.  
  Including forward starting swaps and our net TBA position, our average ratio of interest rate swaps outstanding to our average mortgage borrowings and net TBA position (at cost) was   66%   and   72%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   87%   and   81%  , respectively, for the prior year period.

Net Spread and Dollar Roll Income 
  The table below presents a reconciliation of our net interest income (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) to our net spread and dollar roll income and to our net spread and dollar roll income, excluding estimated "catch-up" premium amortization cost, (non-GAAP financial measures)   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions):

     Net spread and dollar roll income, excluding "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased to   $0.64   from   $0.51   per common share for the prior year period, driven by higher "at risk" leverage, lower total cost of funds and lower operating costs.   Net spread and dollar roll income, excluding "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments, for the nine months   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $1.72   from   $1.81   per common share for the prior year period, largely due to higher repo costs and a decline in TBA dollar roll income relative to our average TBA position, partially offset by higher "at risk" leverage and lower operating costs.   
  Our average net interest rate spread and dollar roll income (i.e., the difference between the average yield on our assets and our average cost of funds inclusive of TBAs), excluding catch-up premium amortization cost, was   1.47%   and   1.39%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.37%   and   1.52%   for the prior year period.  Including catch-up premium amortization adjustments, our net interest rate spread and dollar roll income was   1.42%   and   1.18%     for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.14%   and   1.48%  , respectively, for the prior year period.

For further details regarding our use of derivative instruments and related activity refer to Notes   3   and   6   of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form   10-Q  . 

Operating Expenses 
  Prior to our acquisition of AMM and related management internalization on July 1, 2016, we paid our Manager a management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.25% of our month-end stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in either retained earnings or accumulated OCI, each as computed in accordance with GAAP.  There was no incentive compensation payable to our Manager pursuant to the management agreement.  We incurred management fees of   $52 million   for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and   $29 million   and   $88 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Following our management internalization, we no longer incur a management fee, but we incur expenses associated with an internally managed organization, including compensation expense previously borne by our Manager.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had compensation and benefits expense of   $9 million  , consisting of base salary, bonus accruals and benefits expense.  As of September 30, 2016, we had not granted stock-based long-term incentive compensation awards to our employees, and, as a result, third quarter compensation and benefits expense does not include long-term compensation expense for our employees.   On November 4, 2016, we filed a proxy statement soliciting stockholder approval for our 2016 equity plan, and we intend to make grants thereunder to both attract, motivate and retain high quality employees and directors and align our employees and directors with the interests of our stockholders.  We would expect these grants to, in turn, be recognized as compensation and benefits expense in subsequent periods. 
  
    44 

Other operating expenses were   $6 million   and   $5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $27 million   and   $18 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Other operating expenses primarily consist of prime broker fees, amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of AMM, information technology costs, accounting fees, legal fees, Board of Director fees, insurance expense and general overhead expenses.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , our other operating expenses included $9 million of non-recurring transaction costs associated with our acquisition of AMM. 
  Our total annualized operating expense as a percentage of our average stockholders' equity was   0.76%   and   1.57%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   1.51%   and   1.57%     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Excluding non-recurring transaction costs, our total annualized operating expense as a percentage of our average stockholders' equity was   1.35%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had estimated taxable income available to common stockholders of   $63 million   and   $59 million   (or   $0.19   and   $0.17   per common share), respectively, and for   the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had estimated taxable income available to common stockholders of   $210 million   and   $340 million   (or   $0.63   and   $0.97   per common share), respectively.   
  As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually   90%   of our ordinary taxable income to maintain our status as a REIT and all of our taxable income to avoid federal and state corporate income taxes.  We can treat dividends declared by September 15 and paid by December 31 as having been a distribution of our taxable income for our prior tax year ("spill-back provision"). Income as determined under GAAP differs from income as determined under tax rules because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition.  The primary differences are (i) unrealized gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and other derivatives and securities marked-to-market in current income for GAAP purposes, but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled, (ii) timing differences, both temporary and potentially permanent, in the recognition of certain realized gains and losses and (iii) temporary differences related to the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments.  Furthermore, our estimated taxable income is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing our appropriate tax returns, which occurs after the end of our fiscal year.   
  The following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to our estimated taxable income   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.4 billion   (or   $1.08   per common share) of net capital loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward and applied against future net capital gains through fiscal year 2018.

The tax characterization of our fiscal year 2016 dividends will be determined and reported to stockholders on their annual Form 1099-DIV statement after the end of the year. 

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
   The following table summarizes the components of our other comprehensive income (loss)   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions):

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our primary sources of funds are borrowings under master repurchase agreements, asset sales, receipts of monthly principal and interest payments on our investment portfolio and equity offerings.  We also enter into TBA contracts as a means of acquiring or disposing of agency securities and utilize TBA dollar roll transactions to finance agency MBS purchases.  Because the level of our borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis, the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on our balance sheet is significantly less important than the potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements.  Our leverage may vary periodically depending on market conditions and our assessment of risks and returns. We generally would expect our leverage to be within six to eleven times the amount of our stockholders' equity.  However, under certain market conditions, we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time.   
  We currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments, repayments on borrowings, maintenance of any margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for our continued qualification as a REIT.  To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income.  As long as we qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable net income to the extent that we distribute our annual taxable net income to our stockholders in a timely manner. We currently expect to distribute 100% of our taxable income so that we are not subject to federal and state income taxes. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital from operations.  
  Debt Capital   
   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our mortgage borrowings and net TBA position consisted of the following ($ in millions): 

______________________ 
  1. Excludes repurchase agreements used to fund U.S. Treasury securities of   $45 million   and   $25 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  2. Excludes   net payable   for unsettled purchases and sales of investment securities of   $23 million   and   $182 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Our "at risk" leverage ratio was   7.2  x as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   6.8  x as of   December 31, 2015  , measured as the sum of our total mortgage borrowings, net TBA position (at cost) and net payable for unsettled investment securities divided by the sum of our total stockholders' equity less our investments in REIT equity securities.  Our tangible net book value "at risk" leverage was   7.7  x our tangible stockholders' equity as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Repurchase Agreements 
  As part of our investment strategy, we borrow against our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements. We expect that the majority of our borrowings under such master repurchase agreements will have maturities ranging up to one year, but we may have longer-term borrowings ranging up to five years or longer.  Borrowings under our master repurchase agreements with maturities greater than 90 days will typically have floating rates of interest based on LIBOR plus or minus a fixed spread.   
  As of   September 30, 2016   , we had   $37.6 billion   of repurchase agreements outstanding used to fund acquisitions of investment securities with a weighted average cost of funds of   0.83%   and a weighted average remaining days-to-maturity of   199   days, compared $  41.7 billion  ,   0.61%   and   173   days, respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  To limit our exposure to counterparty credit risk, we diversify our funding across multiple counterparties and by counterparty region.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had master repurchase agreements with   38   financial institutions located throughout North America, Europe and Asia.  As of   September 30, 2016  , less than   5%   of our stockholders' equity was at risk with any one repo counterparty, with the top five repo counterparties representing less than   12%   of our stockholders' equity.  The table below includes a summary of our repurchase agreement funding by number of repo counterparties and counterparty region as of   September 30,  
  
    47 

2016  .  For further details regarding our borrowings under repurchase agreements and concentration of credit risk as of   September 30, 2016  , please refer to Notes   5   and   7   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q  .  

Amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender's determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. In addition, our counterparties apply a "haircut" to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value. This haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value, but conversely subjects us to counterparty risk and limits the amount we can borrow against our investment securities.  Our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut; rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis.  Throughout   the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , haircuts on our pledged collateral remained stable and, as of   September 30, 2016  , our weighted average haircut was approximately 5% of the value of our collateral.   
   Under our repurchase agreements, we may be required to pledge additional assets to the repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such counterparties demand additional collateral (a "margin call"), which may take the form of additional securities or cash.  Specifically, margin calls would result from a decline in the value of our securities securing our repurchase agreements and prepayments on the mortgages securing such securities.  Similarly, if the estimated fair value of our investment securities increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, counterparties may release collateral back to us.  Our repurchase agreements generally provide that the valuations of securities securing our repurchase agreements are to be obtained from a generally recognized source agreed to by the parties.  However, in certain circumstances under certain of our repurchase agreements our lenders have the sole discretion to determine their value.  In such instances, our lenders are required to act in good faith in making determinations of value. Our repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call, we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that a margin call is made if the lender provides us notice prior to the margin notice deadline on such day. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had met all of our margin requirements and we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $1.3 billion   and unpledged securities of approximately   $2.2 billion  , including securities pledged to us and unpledged interests in our consolidated VIEs, available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and other funding liabilities, derivative instruments and for other corporate purposes. 
  Although we believe we will have adequate sources of liquidity available to us through repurchase agreement financing to execute our business strategy, there can be no assurances that repurchase agreement financing will be available to us upon the maturity of our current repurchase agreements to allow us to renew or replace our repurchase agreement financing on favorable terms or at all.  If our repurchase agreement lenders default on their obligations to resell the underlying collateral back to us at the end of the term, we could incur a loss equal to the difference between the value of the collateral and the cash we originally received.  
  Our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC ("BES"), formed in 2015, became operational and received final membership approval to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC") during the third quarter of 2016, thereby providing us with access to additional repurchase agreement funding capabilities in the wholesale market.  As of September 30, 2016, we had entered into $1.2 billion of repurchase agreement funding through BES and expect to continue to expand our financing activity through BES over the next several quarters. 
  To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows, we utilize an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long-term fixed rate assets during a period of rising interest rates.  The principal derivative instruments that we use are interest rate swaps, supplemented with the use of interest rate swaptions, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury futures contracts, TBA securities and  
  
    48 

other instruments.  Please refer to Notes   3   and   6   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for further details regarding our use of derivative instruments. 
  Our derivative agreements typically require that we pledge/receive collateral on such agreements to/from our counterparties in a similar manner as we are required to under our repurchase agreements.  Our counterparties, or the clearing agency in the case of centrally cleared interest rate swaps, typically have the sole discretion to determine the value of the derivative instruments and the value of the collateral securing such instruments.  In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day.    
  Similar to repurchase agreements, our use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that our counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. We minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and by monitoring positions with individual counterparties.  Excluding centrally cleared interest rate swaps, as of   September 30, 2016  , our amount at risk with any counterparty related to our interest rate swap and swaption agreements was less than   1%   of our stockholders' equity.   In the case of centrally cleared interest rate swap contracts, we could be exposed to credit risk if the central clearing agency or a clearing member defaults on its respective obligation to perform under the contract. However, we believe that the risk is minimal due to the exchange's initial and daily mark to market margin requirements and a clearinghouse guarantee fund and other resources that are available in the event of a clearing member default. 
  TBA Dollar Roll Transactions 
  TBA dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing accounted for as derivative instruments and we may use them as a means of leveraging (or deleveraging) our investment portfolio through the use of long (or short) TBA contracts. (See Notes   3   and   6   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q  ).  
    
  Under certain market conditions, it may be uneconomical for us to roll our TBA contracts into future months and we may need to take or make physical delivery of the underlying securities.  If we were required to take physical delivery to settle a long TBA contract, we would have to fund our total purchase commitment with cash or other financing sources and our liquidity position could be negatively impacted.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a net long TBA position with a total market value and a total cost basis of   $15.6 billion   and   $15.5 billion  , respectively, and a net carrying value of   $46 million   recognized in derivative assets/(liabilities), at fair value, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q  . 
    
  Our TBA dollar roll contracts are also subject to margin requirements governed by the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division ("MBSD") of the FICC and by our prime brokerage agreements, which may establish margin levels in excess of the MBSD.  Such provisions require that we establish an initial margin based on the notional value of the TBA contract, which is subject to increase if the estimated fair value of our TBA contract or the estimated fair value of our pledged collateral declines.  The MBSD has the sole discretion to determine the value of our TBA contracts and of the pledged collateral securing such contracts.  In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day. 
    
  Settlement of our TBA obligations by taking delivery of the underlying securities as well as satisfying margin requirements could negatively impact our liquidity position.  However, since we do not use TBA dollar roll transactions as our primary source of financing, we believe that we will have adequate sources of liquidity to meet such obligations.  
  Federal Home Loan Bank Membership 
    
  In April 2015, our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Old Georgetown Insurance Co., LLC ("OGI"), was approved as a member of the FHLB of Des Moines.  The FHLBs provide a variety of products and services to their members, including short and long-term secured loans, called "advances."  In January 2016, the FHFA released its final rule on changes to regulations concerning FHLB membership criteria.  The final rule terminates OGI's FHLB membership and requires repayment of all advances at the earlier of their contractual maturity dates or one year after the effective date of the final rule (February 2017).  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $3.0 billion   of FHLB advances outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   0.63%   and a weighted average remaining days to maturity of   123   days up to February 2017.  Termination of our FHLB membership could negatively impact our liquidity position; however, since FHLB advances do not represent our primary source of funding, we believe that we will have adequate alternative sources of funding upon such termination.  
    
   FHLB members may use a variety of real estate related assets, including agency MBS and non-agency securities, as collateral for advances. The ability to borrow from the FHLB during the duration of our FHLB membership is subject to our subsidiary's continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB.  FHLB advances typically require higher effective "haircuts" than those required under our current repurchase agreements due to the combination of slightly higher haircuts implemented by the FHLB of Des Moines and the requirement to  
  
    49 

acquire activity-based stock in the FHLB concurrent with such borrowings.  The FHLBs also determine the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral and retain the right to adjust collateral haircuts over the term of the secured borrowings.  
    
  Asset Sales and TBA Eligible Securities 
  We maintain a portfolio of highly liquid mortgage-backed securities.  We may sell our agency securities through the TBA market by delivering them into TBA contracts, subject to "good delivery" provisions promulgated by Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ("SIFMA").  We may alternatively sell agency securities that have more unique attributes on a specified basis when such securities trade at a premium over generic TBA securities or if the securities are not otherwise eligible for TBA delivery.  Since the TBA market is the second most liquid market (second to the U.S. Treasury market), maintaining a significant level of agency securities eligible for TBA delivery enhances our liquidity profile and provides price support for our TBA eligible securities at or above generic TBA prices.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   86%   of our fixed rate agency MBS portfolio was eligible for TBA delivery.   
  Equity Capital 
  To the extent we raise additional equity capital through follow-on equity offerings or under our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan, we may use cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional investment securities, to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our funding liabilities and for other general corporate purposes.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms.  Furthermore, when the trading price of our common stock is significantly less than our estimate of our current net asset value per common share, among other conditions, we may repurchase shares of our common stock. 
  Common Stock Repurchase Program 
  In October 2012, our Board of Directors adopted a program that provided for stock repurchases, which, as amended, authorized repurchases of our common stock up to $2 billion through December 31, 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total remaining amount authorized for repurchases of our common stock was   $0.6 billion  .  In October 2016, our Board of Directors terminated our existing stock repurchase program and replaced it with a new stock repurchase authorization.  Under the new stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2017.  (See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for additional details). During   the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   6.5 million   shares of our common stock at an average repurchase price of   $17.89   per share, including expenses, totaling   $116 million  .  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  Further, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities. 
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This document contains "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that inherently involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and liquidity can differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of changes in the level and composition of our investments and other factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, the availability of suitable investments from both an investment return and regulatory perspective, the availability of new investment capital, fluctuations in interest rates and levels of mortgage prepayments, deterioration in credit quality and ratings, the effectiveness of risk management strategies, the impact of leverage, liquidity of secondary markets and credit markets, increases in costs and other general competitive factors.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate, prepayment, spread, liquidity, extension, credit and inflation risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
  Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities, by affecting the spread between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of prepayments of our securities and the value of the mortgage securities that constitute our investment portfolio, which affects our net income and ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets and impacts our ability and the amount that we can borrow against these securities. 
  We may utilize a variety of financial instruments in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations.   The principal instruments that we use are interest rate swaps and swaptions.  We also utilize U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts, primarily through short sales, as well as TBA contracts.  We may also purchase or write put or call options on TBA securities and invest in mortgage and other types of derivative instruments, such as interest and principal-only securities.  Derivative instruments may expose us to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
  Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives used for hedging purposes) may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates including changes in the forward yield curve.  
  Primary measures of an instrument's price sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations are its duration and convexity.  Duration  measures the estimated percentage change in market value of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates.  The duration of our investment portfolio changes with interest rates and tends to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall.  This "negative convexity" generally increases the interest rate exposure of our investment portfolio in excess of what is measured by duration alone.   
  We estimate the duration and convexity of our portfolio using both a third-party risk management system and market data. We review the duration estimates from the third-party model and may make adjustments based on our judgment.  These adjustments are intended to better reflect the unique characteristics and market trading conventions associated with certain types of securities.     
  The table below quantifies the estimated changes in (i) net interest income (including periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps); (ii) the fair value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes); and (iii) our net asset value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   should interest rates go up or down by 50 and 100 basis points, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve and including the impact of both duration and convexity.   
  All changes in income and value in the table below are measured as percentage changes from the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates and prepayment projections as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  We apply a floor of 0% for the down rate scenarios on our interest bearing liabilities and the variable leg of our interest rate swaps, such that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level.  
  Actual results could differ materially from estimates, especially in the current market environment.  To the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true, which is likely in a period of high price volatility, actual results will likely differ materially from projections.  Moreover, if different models were employed in the analysis, materially different projections could result.  Lastly, while the table below reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on a static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio and we continuously make adjustments to the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio.

    Represents the estimated dollar change in net interest income expressed as a percent of net interest income based on asset yields and cost of funds as of such date.  It includes the effect of periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps, but excludes costs associated with our forward starting swaps and other supplemental hedges, such as swaptions and U.S. Treasury securities.  Amounts also exclude costs associated with our TBA position and TBA dollar roll income/loss, which are accounted for as derivative instruments in accordance with GAAP.  Base case scenario assumes interest rates and forecasted CPR of   11%   and   8%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , rate shock scenarios assume a forecasted CPR of   16%  ,   13%  ,   9%   and   8%   for the -100, -50, +50 and +100 basis points scenarios, respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , rate shock scenarios assume a forecasted CPR of   12%  ,   10%  ,   8%   and   7%   for such scenarios, respectively. Estimated dollar change in net interest income does not include the impact of retroactive "catch-up" premium amortization adjustments due to changes in our forecasted CPR.  Down rate scenarios assume a floor of 0% for anticipated interest rates.

     Prepayment Risk 
  Because residential borrowers have the option to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments faster than anticipated. Various factors affect the rate at which mortgage prepayments occur, including changes in the level of and directional trends in housing prices, interest rates, general economic conditions, loan age and size, loan-to-value ratio, the location of the property and social and demographic conditions. Additionally, changes to GSE underwriting practices or other governmental programs could also significantly impact prepayment rates or expectations.  Also, the pace at which the loans underlying our securities become seriously delinquent or are modified and the timing of GSE repurchases of such loans from our securities can materially impact the rate of prepayments. Generally, prepayments on residential mortgage-backed securities increase during periods of falling mortgage interest rates and decrease during periods of rising mortgage interest rates. However, this may not always be the case.  
  We may reinvest principal repayments at a yield that is lower or higher than the yield on the repaid investment, thus affecting our net interest income by altering the average yield on our assets. We also amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of mortgage securities into interest income over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the effective interest method. Our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate published prepayment data for similar securities, market consensus and current market conditions. If the actual prepayment experienced differs from our estimate of prepayments, we will be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income. 
  Spread Risk 
    
  When the market spread between the yield on our investment securities and benchmark interest rates widens, our net book value could decline if the value of our investment securities fall by more than the offsetting fair value increases on our hedging instruments tied to the underlying benchmark interest rates. We refer to this as "spread risk" or "basis risk."  The spread risk associated with our mortgage assets and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of changes in benchmark interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or  
  
    52 

anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, market liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets.  Consequently, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, such instruments typically will not protect our net book value against spread risk. 
  The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes) and in our net asset value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   should spreads widen or tighten by 10 and 25 basis points.  The estimated impact of changes in spreads is in addition to our interest rate shock sensitivity included in the interest rate shock table above.  The table below assumes a spread duration of 4.5 years and 5.2 years as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on interest rates and MBS prices as of such dates.  However, our portfolio's sensitivity of mortgage spread changes will vary with changes in interest rates and in the size and composition of our investment portfolio.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

  The primary liquidity risk for us arises from financing long-term assets with shorter-term borrowings through repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and other short-term funding agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of   $1.3 billion   and unpledged securities of approximately   $2.2 billion  , including securities pledged to us and unpledged interests in our consolidated VIEs, available to meet margin calls on our funding liabilities and derivative contracts and for other corporate purposes.  However, should the value of our collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, margin calls relating to our funding liabilities and derivative agreements could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew (or roll) our short-term funding liabilities. In addition, our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts (margin requirements) on the assets we pledge against our funding liabilities, thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll such funding liabilities. Significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or even force us to sell assets, especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets. 
  In addition, we often utilize TBA dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing agency mortgage-backed securities.  Under certain economic conditions it may be uneconomical to roll our TBA dollar roll transactions prior to the settlement date and we could have to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and settle our obligations for cash, which could negatively impact our liquidity position, result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse conditions. 
  Extension Risk 
  The projected weighted-average life and estimated duration, or interest rate sensitivity, of our investments is based on our assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans.  In general, we use interest rate  
  
    53 

swaps and swaptions to help manage our funding cost on our investments in the event that interest rates rise.  These swaps (or swaptions) allow us to reduce our funding exposure on the notional amount of the swap for a specified period of time by establishing a fixed rate to pay in exchange for receiving a floating rate that generally tracks our financing costs under our funding liabilities. 
  However, if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment, the average life or duration of our fixed rate assets generally extends. This could have a negative impact on our results from operations, as our interest rate swap maturities are fixed and will, therefore, cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our mortgage assets to the extent that their average lives increase due to slower prepayments. This situation may also cause the market value of our fixed rate securities to decline by more than otherwise would be the case while most of our hedging instruments would not receive any incremental offsetting gains.  In extreme situations, we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur realized losses. 
  Credit Risk 
  We are exposed to credit risk related to our CRT and non-agency investments, certain derivative transactions, and our collateral held by funding and derivative counterparties. We accept credit exposure at levels we deem prudent as an integral part of our investment and hedging strategy.  We seek to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, sale of assets where we have identified negative credit trends and the use of various types of credit enhancements. We may also use non-recourse financing, which limits our exposure to credit losses to the specific pool of mortgages subject to the non-recourse financing. Our overall management of credit exposure may also include the use of credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that we believe are appropriate. Additionally, we intend to vary the percentage mix of our investments in an effort to actively adjust our credit exposure and to improve the risk/return profile of our investment portfolio. Our credit risk related to certain derivative transactions is largely mitigated through daily adjustments to collateral pledged based on changes in market value and we limit our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. There is no guarantee that our efforts to manage credit risk will be successful and we could suffer losses if credit performance is worse than our expectations or if economic conditions worsen. 
  Inflation Risk 
  Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature.  As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than does inflation.  Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates.  Further, our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our Board of Directors based in part on our net income as calculated for income tax purposes.  In each case, our activities and consolidated balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" as promulgated under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  We, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisition of AMM on July 1, 2016.  Where appropriate, we are reviewing related internal controls and making changes to align and integrate AMM into our financial control environment. This initiative is being done as a part of our integration plan and is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company s or AMM s internal control over financial reporting.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact:  
  (a) that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or  
  (b) that he or she, being at the time a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (collectively, "another enterprise" or "other enterprise"), 
  whether either in case (a) or in case (b) the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or inaction (x) in an official capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation, or as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of such other enterprise, or (y) in any other capacity related to the Corporation or such other enterprise while so serving as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by Section 145 of the General Corporation Law, (or any successor provision or provisions, respectively) as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, respectively (but, in the case of any amendment to Section 145 of the General Corporation Law, with respect to actions taken prior to such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith if such person satisfied the applicable level of care to permit such indemnification under the General Corporation Law; provided however, that nothing in this Article VII shall indemnify any person to the extent that such person has committed willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard involved in the conduct of such person's duties to or for the Corporation. The persons indemnified by this Article VII are hereinafter referred to as "indemnities."  Such indemnification as to  

such alleged action or inaction shall continue as to an indemnitee who has after such alleged action or inaction ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation, or director, officer, employee or agent of another enterprise; and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article VII: (i) shall be a contract right; (ii) shall  not be affected adversely as to any indemnitee by any amendment of this Certificate with respect to any action or inaction occurring prior to such amendment; and (iii) shall, subject to any requirements imposed by law and the By-laws, include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition. 
  Section 7.2.        Relationship to Other Rights and Provisions Concerning Indemnification.      The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, this Certificate, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. The By-laws may contain such other provisions concerning indemnification, including provisions specifying reasonable procedures relating to and conditions to the receipt by indemnitees of indemnification, provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article VII. 
  Section 7.3        Agents and Employees.      The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses, to any agent of the Corporation (or any person serving at the Corporation's request as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another enterprise) or to persons who are or were a director, officer, employee or agent of any of the Corporation's affiliates, predecessor or subsidiary corporations or of a constituent corporation absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or merger or who is or was serving at the request of such affiliate, predecessor or subsidiary corporation or of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another enterprise, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII in cases of the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation, or to any lesser extent (or greater extent, if permitted by law) determined by the Board of Directors.

  Section 8.2        Capital Stock. 
    Section 8.2.1        Ownership Limitations.      During the period commencing on the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date:  
    (a)   Basic Restrictions. 
    (i) (1) No Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own either shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or shares of Common Stock in excess of the Common Stock Ownership Limit and (2) no Excepted Holder shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder.  
    (ii) No Person shall Beneficially or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock to the extent that such Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of Capital Stock would result in the Corporation being  closely held  within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, Beneficial or Constructive Ownership to the extent that such Beneficial or Constructive Ownership would result in the Corporation owning (actually or Constructively) a 9.9% interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code (for this purpose, a tenant from whom the Corporation (or an entity owned or controlled by the Corporation) derives (and is expected to continue to derive) a sufficiently small amount of revenue such that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, rent from such tenant would not adversely affect the Corporation s ability to qualify as a REIT, shall not be treated as a tenant of the Corporation)).  
    (iii) Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, no Person shall Transfer of shares of Capital Stock (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) that, if effective, would result in the Capital Stock being Beneficially Owned by less than 100 Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code).  
    (b)   Transfer in Trust.      If any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock (whether or not such Transfer is the result of a transaction entered into through the facilities of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system) occurs which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 8.2.1(a),  
    (i) then that number of shares of Capital Stock the Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 8.2.1(a) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 8.3, effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer (or other event), and such Person shall acquire no rights in such shares of Capital Stock; or  

(ii) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (i) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 8.2.1(a), then the Transfer of that number of shares of Capital Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 8.2.1(a) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares of Capital Stock. 
    (iii) In determining which shares of Capital Stock are to be transferred to a Trust in accordance with this Section 8.2.1(b) and Section 8.3 hereof, shares shall be so transferred to a Trust in such manner that minimizes the aggregate value of the shares that are transferred to the Trust (except to the extent that the Board of Directors determines that the shares transferred to the Trust shall be those directly or indirectly held or Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned by a Person or Persons that caused or contributed to the application of this Section 8.2.1(b)), and to the extent not inconsistent therewith, on a pro rata basis.  
    (iv) To the extent that, upon a transfer of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to this Section 8.2.1(b), a violation of Section 8.2.1(a) would nonetheless be continuing, (for example where the ownership of shares of Capital Stock by a single Trust would result in the Capital Stock being beneficially owned (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) by less than 100 persons), the shares of Capital Stock shall be transferred to that number of Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and a Charitable Beneficiary or Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other Trust, such that there is no violation of Section 8.2.1(a). 
    Section 8.2.2        Remedies for Breach.      If the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any duly authorized committee thereof (or other designees if permitted by the General Corporation Law) shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 8.2.1(a) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 8.2.1(a) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board of Directors or a committee thereof (or other designees if permitted by the General Corporation Law) shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Corporation to redeem shares of Capital Stock, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 8.2.1(a) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Trust described above and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.  
    Section 8.2.3        Notice of Restricted Transfer.      Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock that will or may violate Section 8.2.1(a) or any Person who would have owned shares of Capital Stock that resulted in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of  Section 8.2.1(b) shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer on the Corporation s qualification as a REIT. 
    Section 8.2.4        Owners Required to Provide Information  . From the Initial Date and prior to the Restriction Termination Date:  
    (a) every owner of more than five percent (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) in number or value of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, shall give written notice to the Corporation stating the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of Capital Stock and other  

shares of the Capital Stock Beneficially Owned and a description of the manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner shall provide to the Corporation such additional information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Corporation s qualification as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and the Common Stock Ownership Limit; and  
    (b) each Person who is a Beneficial or Constructive Owner of Capital Stock and each Person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding Capital Stock for a Beneficial or Constructive Owner shall provide to the Corporation such information as the Corporation may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Corporation s qualification as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and the Common Stock Ownership Limit.  
    Section 8.2.5        Remedies Not Limited.      Subject to Section 5.6 of the Certificate of Incorporation, nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Corporation and the interests of its stockholders in preserving the Corporation s qualification as a REIT.       
    Section 8.2.6        Ambiguity.      In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 or any definition contained in Section 8.1, the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 or any such definition with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it. In the event Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 requires an action by the Board of Directors and the Certificate of Incorporation fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3. Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board of Directors (which the Board of Directors may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 8.2.1) acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Capital Stock in violation of Section 8.2.1, such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the shares of Capital Stock that, but for such remedies, would have been actually owned by such Person, and second to shares of Capital Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who actually own such shares of Capital Stock based upon the relative number of the shares of Capital Stock held by each such Person.  
    Section 8.2.7        Exceptions.    
    (a) Subject to Section 8.2.1, the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a Person from the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Common Stock Ownership Limit, or both such limits and may establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if:  
    (i) the Board of Directors obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that no individual s Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of such shares of Capital Stock will violate Section 8.2.1(a)(ii);       
     (ii) such Person does not and represents that it will not own, actually or Constructively, an interest in a tenant of the Corporation (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by the Corporation) that would cause the Corporation to own, actually or Constructively, more than a 9.9% interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant and the Board of Directors obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain this fact; and        

(iii) such Person agrees that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the restrictions contained in Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.6) will result in such shares of Capital Stock being automatically transferred to a Trust in accordance with Sections 8.2.1(b) and 8.3.  
    (b) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 8.2.7(a), the Board of Directors of the Corporation may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Corporation s qualification as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception.  
    (c) Subject to Section 8.2.1(a)(ii), an underwriter or placement agent that participates in a public offering or a private placement of Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock) in excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Common Stock Ownership Limit, or both such limits, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering or private placement.  
    (d) The Board of Directors may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder: (i) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (ii) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or the Common Stock Ownership Limit, as the case may be. 
    Section 8.2.8        Change in Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and Common Stock Ownership Limit.      The Board of Directors may from time to time increase or decrease the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and Common Stock Ownership Limit; provided, however, that a decreased Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or Common Stock Ownership Limit will not be effective for any Person whose percentage ownership of Capital Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, is in excess of such decreased Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or Common Stock Ownership Limit until such time as such Person's percentage of Capital Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, equals or falls below the decreased Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit     or Common Stock Ownership, but until such time as such Person's percentage of Capital Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, falls below such decreased Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or Common Stock Ownership Limit, any further acquisition of Capital Stock or Common Stock will be in violation of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or Common Stock Ownership Limit and, provided further, that the new Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit or Common Stock Ownership Limit would not allow five or fewer individuals (as defined in Section 542(a)(2) of the Code and taking into account all Excepted Holders) to Beneficially Own more than 49.9% in value of the outstanding Capital Stock.  If the Board of Directors changes the Common Stock Ownership Limit and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, it will (i) notify each stockholder of record of any such change, and (ii) publicly announce any such change, in each case at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such change. 
    Section 8.2.9        Legend.      Each certificate for shares of Capital Stock shall bear substantially the following legend:  
   The shares of any class or series of the Corporation s stock (the  Capital Stock ) represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership and Transfer (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation")) for the purpose of the  

Corporation's maintenance of its status as a real estate investment trust (a  REIT ) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Subject to certain further restrictions and except as expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) no Person (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of the Corporation s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Common Stock ) in excess of 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), in which case the Excepted Holder Limit (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be applicable; (ii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Capital Stock, unless such Person is an Excepted Holder, in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable; (iii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock that would result in the Corporation being  closely held  under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a REIT; and (iv) no Person may Transfer shares of Capital Stock if such Transfer would result in the Capital Stock of the Corporation being owned by fewer than 100 Persons. Any Person who Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns, or attempts to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock which causes or will cause a Person to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess or in violation of the above limitations must immediately notify the Corporation. If any of the above restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership or Transfer are violated, the shares of Capital Stock represented hereby will be automatically transferred to a Trust (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation). In addition, the Board of Directors shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Corporation to redeem shares of Capital Stock; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of the above restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership and Transfer shall automatically result in the above transfer to the Trust and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors may, pursuant to Section 8.2.8 of the Certificate of Incorporation, increase or decrease the percentage of Common Stock or Capital Stock that a person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own. 
  A copy of the Certificate of Incorporation, including the above restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership and Transfer, will be furnished to each holder of Capital Stock on request and without charge. Requests for such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal office.   
  Instead of the foregoing legend, the certificate may state that the Corporation will furnish a full statement about certain restrictions on transferability to a stockholder on request and without charge. 
  Section 8.3        Transfer of Capital Stock in Trust.    
    Section 8.3.1        Ownership in Trust.      Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 8.2.1(a) that would result in a transfer of shares of Capital Stock to a Trust, such shares of Capital Stock shall be deemed to have been transferred to the Trustee as trustee of a Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Such transfer to the Trustee shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the purported Transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 8.2.1(b). The Trustee shall be appointed by the Corporation and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Corporation and any Prohibited Owner. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Corporation as provided in Section 8.3.6.  
    Section 8.3.2        Status of Shares Held by the Trustee.      Shares of Capital Stock held by the Trustee shall continue to be issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation. The  

Prohibited Owner shall have no rights in the shares of Capital Stock held by the Trustee. The Prohibited Owner shall not benefit economically from ownership of any shares held in trust by the Trustee, shall have no rights to dividends or other distributions and shall not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares held in the Trust.  
    Section 8.3.3        Dividend and Voting Rights.      The Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Capital Stock held in the Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid to a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee shall be paid with respect to such shares of Capital Stock by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee upon demand and any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Trustee. Any dividend or distribution so paid to the Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to shares held in the Trust and, subject to the General Corporation Law, effective as of the date that the shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee shall have the authority (at the Trustee s sole discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided, however, that if the Corporation has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast such vote. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VIII, until the Corporation has received notification that shares of Capital Stock have been transferred into a Trust, the Corporation shall be entitled to rely on its share transfer and other stockholder records for purposes of preparing lists of stockholders entitled to vote at meetings, determining the validity and authority of proxies and otherwise conducting votes of stockholders.  
  Section 8.3.4        Sale of Shares by Trustee.      Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Corporation that shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trust, the Trustee of the Trust shall sell the shares held in the Trust to a person, designated by the Trustee, whose ownership of the shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section 8.2.1(a). Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section 8.3.4. The Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (i) the price paid by the Prohibited Owner for the shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to be held in the Trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the Market Price of the shares on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in the Trust and (ii) the price per share received by the Trustee (net of any commissions and other expenses of sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the Trust. The Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the Prohibited Owner and owned by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.3.3 of this Article VIII. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary. If, prior to the discovery by the Corporation that shares of Capital Stock have been transferred to the Trustee, such shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (a) such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Trust and (b) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 8.3.4, such excess shall be paid to the Trustee upon demand. 
    Section 8.3.5        Purchase Right in Stock Transferred to the Trustee.      Shares of Capital Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee, accepts such offer.  

The Corporation may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the Prohibited Owner and owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.3.3 of this Article VIII. The Corporation may pay the amount of such reduction to the Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares held in the Trust pursuant to Section 8.3.4. Upon such a sale to the Corporation, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and any dividends or other distributions held by the Trustee shall be paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.  
    Section 8.3.6        Designation of Charitable Beneficiaries.   By written notice to the Trustee, the Corporation shall designate one or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Trust such that (i) the shares of Capital Stock held in the Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2.1(a) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (ii) each such organization must be described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code and contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code.  
  Section 8.4        Nasdaq Transactions.      Nothing in this Article VIII shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered into through the facilities of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. The fact that the settlement of any transaction occurs shall not negate the effect of any other provision of this Article VIII and any transferee in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article VIII.  
  Section 8.5        Enforcement.      The Corporation is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this Article VIII. 
  Section 8.6        Non-Waiver.      No delay or failure on the part of the Corporation or the Board of Directors in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Corporation or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, except to the extent specifically waived in writing.  
  Section 8.7        Severability.      If any provision of this Article VIII or any application of any such provision is determined to be invalid by any federal or state court having jurisdiction over the issues, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected and other applications of such provisions shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court. 
  ARTICLE IX 
  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS 
  A director of the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent now or hereafter permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law (or any successor provision or provisions), have no personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such director has committed willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of such director's duties involved in the conduct of the office of director.

Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for any proper purpose, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve. 
  Section 8.2   Disbursements  . All checks or demands for money and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate. 
  Section 8.3   Fiscal Year  . The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. 
  Section 8.4   Corporate Seal  . The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. 
  Section 8.5   Executive Office  . The principal executive office of the Corporation shall be located in Bethesda, Maryland or such other location as may be specified by the Board of Directors. The books of account and records shall be kept in such office. The Corporation also may have offices at such other places, both within and without Delaware, as the Board of Directors from time to time shall determine or the business and affairs of the Corporation may require. 
  ARTICLE IX 
  INVESTMENT POLICY 
  Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may from time to time adopt, amend, revise or terminate any policy or policies with respect to investments by the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate in its sole discretion. 
  ARTICLE X 
  INDEMNIFICATION 
  Section 10.1   Indemnification Provisions in Certificate of Incorporation  . The provisions of this ARTICLE X are intended to supplement Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to Section 7.2 therein. To the extent that this ARTICLE X contains any provisions inconsistent with such Article VII, the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation shall govern. Terms used in this ARTICLE X but not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings given such terms in such Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation. 

Section 10.2   Undertakings for Advances of Expenses  . If and to the extent the DGCL requires, an advancement by the Corporation of expenses incurred by an indemnitee pursuant to clause (iii) of the last sentence of Section 7.1 of the Certificate of Incorporation (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses") shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise. 
  Section 10.3   Claims for Indemnification  . If a claim for indemnification under Section 7.1 of the Certificate of Incorporation is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after it has been received in writing by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses only upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 145 of the DGCL (or any successor provision or provisions). Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 145 of the DGCL (or any successor provision or provisions), nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to have or retain such advancement of expenses, under Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation or this ARTICLE X or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation. 
  Section 10.4   Insurance  . The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the DGCL or any other provision of law. 
  Section 10.5   Severability  . In the event that any of the provisions of this ARTICLE X (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions are severable and shall remain enforceable to the full extent permitted by law. 

ARTICLE XI 
  AMENDMENTS 
  Section 11.1   Amendments  .  These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-Laws be contained in the notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors as the case may be. All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of sixty-six percent (66%) of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office.

The IRS requires that the named transfer agent ( we ) report the cost   basis of certain shares or units acquired after January 1, 2011. If your   shares or units are covered by the legislation, and you requested to sell   or transfer the shares or units using a specific cost basis calculation   method, then we have processed as you requested.  If you did not   specify a cost basis calculation method, then we have defaulted to the   first in, first out (FIFO) method. Please consult your tax advisor if you   need additional information about cost basis.   If you do not keep in contact with the issuer or do not have any   activity in your account for the time period specified by state law,   your property may become subject to state unclaimed property   laws and transferred to the appropriate state.

AGNC INVESTMENT CORP.   The Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests, a statement of the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional,   or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof which the Corporation is authorized to issue and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences   and/or rights. Any such request should be addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal office.   The shares of the Corporation s common stock (the  Common Stock ) represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive   Ownership and Transfer (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time (the    Certificate of Incorporation )) for the purpose of the Corporation s maintenance of its status as a real estate investment trust (a  REIT ) under the Internal Revenue Code of   1986, as amended (the  Code ). Subject to certain further restrictions and except as expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, (i) no Person (as defined in the   Certificate of Incorporation) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Common Stock in excess of 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more   restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), in which case the   Excepted Holder Limit (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be applicable; (ii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of any class or   series of the Corporation s stock (the  Capital Stock ) in excess of 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the total outstanding shares of Capital   Stock, unless such Person is an Excepted Holder, in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable; (iii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own   shares of Capital Stock that would result in the Corporation being  closely held  under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause the Corporation to fail to qualify as a   REIT; and (iv) no Person may Transfer shares of Capital Stock if such Transfer would result in the Capital Stock of the Corporation being owned by fewer than 100 Persons.   Any Person who Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns, or attempts to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock which causes or will cause a Person   to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess or in violation of the above limitations must immediately notify the Corporation. If any of the above   restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership or Transfer are violated, the shares of Common Stock represented hereby will be automatically transferred to   a Trust (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation). In addition, the   Board of Directors shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the   Corporation to redeem shares of Capital Stock; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of the above restrictions on Beneficial   Ownership, Constructive Ownership and Transfer shall automatically result in the above transfer to the Trust and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void   ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, pursuant to Section 8.2.8 of the Certificate of   Incorporation, increase or decrease the percentage of Common Stock or Capital Stock that a person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own.   A copy of the Certificate of Incorporation, including the above restrictions on Beneficial Ownership, Constructive Ownership and Transfer, will be furnished to each holder of   Capital Stock on request and without charge. Requests for such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal office.
