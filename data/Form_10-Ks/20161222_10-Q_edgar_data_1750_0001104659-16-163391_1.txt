   Note 1   Basis of Presentation   
     
  AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as  AAR,   Company,   we,   us,  and  our,  unless the context indicates otherwise.  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of AAR and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  
     
  We have prepared these statements without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2016 has been derived from audited financial statements.  To prepare the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain information and note disclosures, normally included in comprehensive financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations of the SEC.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our latest annual report on Form 10-K.  
     
  In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (which consist only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries as of November 30, 2016, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, and the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the six-month period ended November 30, 2016.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.  
     
   New Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition.  This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets.  This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.  This ASU will also supersede certain cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of the new standard by one year which will make the new standard effective for us beginning June 1, 2018.  The ASU may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.  This ASU amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets, including those classified as operating leases under the current accounting guidance.  In addition, this ASU will require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the Company s leasing activities.  This new standard will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.  This ASU requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.

   Note 2   Discontinued Operations   
     
  On March 26, 2015, we completed the sale of our Telair Cargo Group to TransDigm, Inc.  The Telair Cargo Group was comprised of Telair International, Telair US, and Nordisk Aviation Products.  Cash received at closing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 before fees and expenses was $705 million.  The sale also allowed for contingent consideration of up to $35 million based on the occurrence of certain post-closing events related to the A400M cargo system.  We recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale (net of transaction expenses and fees) of $198.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  
     
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a gain of $27.7 million net of expenses representing the resolution of the contingent consideration related to the A400M cargo system.  
     
  During fiscal 2015, we also announced our intention to sell our Precision Systems Manufacturing ( PSM ) businesses comprised of our metal and composite machined and fabricated parts manufacturing operations.  We recognized impairment charges of $57.5 million during fiscal 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the PSM business s net assets to their expected value at the time of sale.  
     
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we decided to retain our composite manufacturing operations within our Expeditionary Services segment as a product line within our mobility products business.  As a result, we reclassified our composite manufacturing operations into continuing operations for all periods presented.  Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we decided to shut down the metal machining operation which had been available for sale.  The shutdown of the metal machining operation was completed prior to the end of the first quarter.  
     
  Telair Cargo Group and PSM s metal machining operation are reported as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.  No amounts for general corporate overhead or interest expense were allocated to discontinued operations during the periods presented.  
     
  Assets of discontinued operations of $0 million and $4.0 million at November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively, were classified as  Deposits, prepaids, and other  on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Liabilities of discontinued operations of $8.2 million and $12.5 million at November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively, were classified as  Accrued Liabilities  on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Operating income from discontinued operations for the three and six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following:  

Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements relate to our continuing operations.

   Note 3   Revenue Recognition   
     
  Sales and related cost of sales for product sales are recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer.  Our standard terms and conditions provide that title passes to the customer when the product is shipped to the customer.  Sales of certain defense products are recognized upon customer acceptance, which includes transfer of title.  Under the majority of our expeditionary airlift services contracts, we are paid and record as revenue a fixed daily amount per aircraft for each day an aircraft is available to perform airlift services.  In addition, we are paid and record as revenue an amount which is based on number of hours flown.  Sales from services and the related cost of services are generally recognized when customer-owned material is shipped back to the customer.  We have adopted this accounting policy because at the time the customer-owned material is shipped back to the customer, all services related to that material are complete as our service agreements generally do not require us to provide services at customer sites.  Furthermore, serviced units are typically shipped to the customer immediately upon completion of the related services.  Sales and related cost of sales for certain large airframe maintenance contracts and performance-based logistics programs are recognized by the percentage of completion method, based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs.  Lease revenues are recognized as earned.  Income from monthly or quarterly rental payments is recorded in the pertinent period according to the lease agreement.  However, for leases that provide variable rents, we recognize lease income on a straight-line basis.  In addition to a monthly lease rate, some engine leases require an additional rental amount based on the number of hours the engine is used in a particular month.  Lease income associated with these contingent rentals is recorded in the period in which actual usage is reported to us by the lessee, which is normally the month following the actual usage.  
     
  Certain supply chain management programs we provide to our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables, such as program and warehouse management, parts distribution, and maintenance and repair services.  We recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the time of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the products and services.  
     
  In June 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the KC10 Extender Contractor Logistics Support Program ( KC10 Program ) to a competitor.  Due to the routine transition period of the services to the new provider, we will continue to provide KC10 Program logistics services up to January 2017 at which point we expect diminished services will continue for an unspecified period of time.  Fiscal 2016 revenue and gross profit for the KC10 Program was $148.1 million and $16.0 million, respectively, while average annual revenue and gross profit recognized over the last three fiscal years was $115.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively.  
     
  Included in accounts receivable as of November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016, are $20.2 million and $29.8 million, respectively, of unbilled accounts receivable related to the KC10 Program.  These unbilled accounts receivable relate to costs we have incurred on parts that were requested and accepted by our customer to support the KC10 Program.  These costs have not been billed by us because the customer has not issued the final paperwork necessary to allow for billing.  
     
   Note 4   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   
     
   Restricted Stock   
     
  In the three month period ended August 31, 2016, as part of our annual long-term stock incentive compensation, we granted 212,583 shares of performance-based restricted stock and 34,100 shares of time-based restricted stock to eligible employees.  The average grant date fair value per share for these shares was $24.00.  In June 2016, we also granted 50,000 shares of time-based restricted stock to members of the Board of Directors with a grant date fair value per share of $24.39.  
     
  Expense charged to operations for restricted stock during the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and $2.6 million and $2.2 million during the six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   Stock Options   
     
  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively.   Expense charged to operations for stock options during the three month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and $2.3 million and $1.7 million during the six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  We maintain a Revolving Credit Facility with various financial institutions, as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders which provides the Company an aggregate revolving credit commitment amount of $500 million.   The Company, under certain circumstances, may request an increase to the revolving credit commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $250 million, not to exceed $750 million in total.  
     
  On November 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility which extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to November 1, 2021, eliminated the covenant condition of no material adverse effects for credit extensions and modified certain other provisions.  
     
  We are subject to a number of covenants under our financing arrangements, including restrictions that relate to the payment of cash dividends, maintenance of minimum net working capital and tangible net worth levels, sales of assets, additional financing, purchase of our shares and other matters.  We are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our financing arrangements as of November 30, 2016.  
     
  At November 30, 2016, our debt had a fair value that approximates the carrying value.  These debt instruments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy which is defined as a fair value determined based upon one or more significant unobservable inputs.  
     
   Convertible Notes   
     
  During the three-month period ended November 30, 2015, we repurchased $9.7 million of our outstanding 2.25% convertible notes due March 1, 2016 for $9.7 million cash and recognized a $0.1 million loss on the early extinguishment of the notes.  During the three-month period ended August 31, 2015, we repurchased $14.4 million of our outstanding 2.25% convertible notes due March 1, 2016 for $14.6 million cash including $0.2 million of accrued interest and recognized a $0.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of the notes.  
     
   Note 8   Earnings per Share   
     
  The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus, when their effect is dilutive, incremental shares consisting of shares subject to stock options and shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards.  
     
  In accordance with ASC 260-10-45,  Share-Based Payment Arrangements and Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method , our unvested restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities since these shares are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common shares.  During periods of net income, the calculation of earnings per share for common stock excludes income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator.  During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.

  A reconciliation of the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share information for the three and six month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

At November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, stock options to purchase 42,000 shares and 181,247 shares of common stock were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of each of these options was greater than the average market price of the common shares during the interim periods then ended.

Note 10   Sale of Product Line   
     
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold certain assets related to our temperature-controlled container product line to Sonoco Protective Solutions, Inc. ( Sonoco ) for $5 million.  The sale price included $3 million paid at closing and $2 million in non-contingent, deferred consideration due over the next two years.  We recognized a gain of $2.6 million on the sale.  In conjunction with the sale, we also entered into a long-term manufacturing agreement to supply temperature-controlled containers to Sonoco over the next three years.

   Note 11   Business Segment Information   
     
  Consistent with how our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance and the way we are organized internally, we report our activities in two business segments:   Aviation Services  comprised of supply chain and maintenance, repair and overhaul ( MRO ) activities and  Expeditionary Services  comprised of airlift and mobility activities.  
     
  The Aviation Services segment consists of businesses that provide spares and maintenance support for aircraft operated by our commercial and government/defense customers.  Sales in the Aviation Services segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and government and defense markets.  We provide customized inventory supply chain management, performance based logistics programs, aircraft component repair management services, and aircraft modifications.  The segment also includes repair, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft, landing gear and components.  We also sell and lease used commercial aircraft through joint venture arrangements.  Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, and overhead.  
     
  The Expeditionary Services segment consists of businesses that provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ), foreign governments and non-governmental organizations.  Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment are derived from the delivery of airlift services to mostly government and defense customers and the design and manufacture of pallets, shelters, and containers used to support the U.S. military s requirements for a mobile and agile force.  We also provide system integration services for specialized command and control systems and composite manufacturing.  Cost of sales consists principally of aircraft maintenance costs, depreciation, the cost of material to manufacture products, direct labor and overhead.  
     
  The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.  Our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure.  Gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from sales.  The assets and certain expenses related to corporate activities are not allocated to the segments.  Our reportable segments are aligned principally around differences in products and services.  
     
  Selected financial information for each segment is as follows:

Note 12   Legal Proceedings   
     
  We are not a party to any material pending legal proceeding (including any governmental or environmental proceeding) other than routine litigation incidental to our business except for the following:  
     
   DynCorp International LLC v. AAR Airlift Group, Inc.   
     
  On November 5, 2015, AAR Airlift Group, Inc.  ( AAR Airlift ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAR CORP. filed with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the  Court ) a motion to dismiss a First Amended Complaint filed by DynCorp International LLC ( DynCorp ) alleging that AAR Airlift misappropriated DynCorp s trade secrets in connection with the submission of proposals pursuant to the solicitation issued by the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation ( INL/A ) in support of the Global Aviation Support Services ( GASS ) program which was subsequently awarded to AAR Airlift on September 1, 2016.  
     
  On January 14, 2016, the Court granted AAR Airlift s motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint.  On February 2, 2016, DynCorp filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the  Court of Appeals ) with respect to the Court s order on the motion to dismiss and other orders issued by the Court in this case.    
     
  On November 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the Court s dismissal of the First Amended Complaint and remanded the case to the Court for further proceedings. The parties have jointly asked the Court to hold a pre-trial conference in the first quarter of 2017 for the purpose of establishing a discovery schedule and addressing other pre-trial matters. AAR Airlift will continue to defend itself vigorously against DynCorp s lawsuit, which it believes it entirely without merit.

   (Dollars in millions)   
     
   General Overview   
     
  We report our activities in two business segments:   Aviation Services  comprised of supply chain and MRO activities and  Expeditionary Services  comprised of airlift and mobility activities.  
     
  The Aviation Services segment consists of businesses that provide spares and maintenance support for aircraft operated by our commercial and government/defense customers.  Sales in the Aviation Services segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and government and defense markets.  We provide customized inventory supply chain management, performance based logistics programs, aircraft component repair management services, and aircraft modifications.  The segment also includes maintenance, repair and overhaul ( MRO ) of aircraft, landing gear and components.  We also sell and lease used commercial aircraft through joint venture arrangements.  Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, and overhead.  
     
  The Expeditionary Services segment consists of businesses that provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ), foreign governments and non-governmental organizations.  Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment are derived from the delivery of airlift services to mostly government and defense customers and the design and manufacture of pallets, shelters, and containers used to support the U.S. military s requirements for a mobile and agile force.  We also provide system integration services for specialized command and control systems and composite manufacturing.  Cost of sales consists principally of aircraft maintenance costs, depreciation, the cost of material to manufacture products, direct labor and overhead.  
     
  In fiscal 2016, our Aviation Services segment succeeded in expanding customer relationships in distribution and securing new program work with multiple international carriers as well as supporting our government customers  MRO and supply chain requirements.  The commercial aviation markets we serve continue to be healthy as many major airlines customers are experiencing strong passenger traffic.  
     
  To further expand our Aviation Services segment revenues in fiscal 2017, we have continued our focus on growth with commercial airline customers through securing additional flight hour component inventory management and repair programs.  During fiscal 2017, our investment in business development has been successful as we have been awarded new contracts from many commercial operators including South African Airways, Air New Zealand, flydubai, CommutAir, Small Planet Airlines, Enter Air, and SaudiGulf.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we invested $31 million in rotable assets to support these programs.  With the routine ramp-up of these programs, we expect revenue and income on these contract awards to begin in the second half of fiscal 2017.  
     
  In our Expeditionary Services segment, we completed the successful start-up of our new contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defence providing search and rescue services in the Falkland Islands in fiscal 2016.  The government markets we serve in this segment in support of troop movements and related activities continue to be weak.  
     
  On September 1, 2016, the Department of State awarded AAR Airlift Group, Inc. the contract for INL Global Aviation Support Services ( GASS ) which will leverage our capabilities in aviation services including flight operations, supply chain logistics, and other services.  The potential duration of this contract is eleven years, including a six month phase-in, a base year plus two options, up to seven award term option years and a six month phase-out.  The GASS contract ceiling, to include all related task orders is $10 billion.  The incumbent contractor filed a protest which was denied by the United States Government Accountability Office.  
     
  We remain in a strong financial position to further execute on our strategy as a best in class aviation and expeditionary services company.  Our cash on hand plus unused capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility was $380 million at November 30, 2016.  We expect to invest opportunistically in expanding our comprehensive suite of services to the global commercial aviation and government and defense markets.

  Telair Cargo Group and PSM s metal machining operation have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we decided to retain our composite manufacturing operations within our Expeditionary Services segment.  As a result, we reclassified our composite manufacturing operations as a continuing operation for all periods presented.  
     
  The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.  Our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure.  Gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from sales.  The assets and certain expenses related to corporate activities are not allocated to the segments.  Our reportable segments are aligned principally around differences in products and services.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  Sales and gross profit for our two business segments for the three- and six months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

nm     Percentage change is not meaningful. 
     
   Three-Month Period Ended November 30, 2016   
     
   Aviation Services Segment   
     
  Sales in the Aviation Services segment decreased $12.9 million or 3.6% from the prior year period principally due to a $16.2 million or 14.8% decrease in sales to government and defense customers.  The decrease in sales to government and defense customers was primarily attributable to lower volumes in distribution of $12.0 million.  In addition, logistics services under our KC10 Program are transitioning to a new provider over the remainder of fiscal 2017 which resulted in decreased sales of $9.2 million from the prior year.  
     
  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, sales in this segment to commercial customers increased $3.3 million or 1.3% over the prior year period.  The increase was primarily due to higher demand in aftermarket parts trading of $12.5 million.  This increase was largely offset by lower sales at our Lake Charles facility as it transitioned from a more comprehensive MRO facility to a limited operation providing only painting services.

Table of Contents   
     
  Cost of sales in Aviation Services decreased $10.7 million or 3.6% over the prior year period which was consistent with the sales decrease discussed above.  Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $2.2 million or 3.8% from the prior year period.  Gross profit on sales to government and defense customers decreased $3.7 million or 21.3% from the prior year with gross profit margin decreasing from 15.9% to 14.7%.  These decreases were driven by the lower sales volume in distribution and the KC10 Program.  
     
  Gross profit on sales to commercial customers increased $1.5 million or 3.7% over the prior year period primarily driven by the higher volumes in aftermarket parts trading.  The gross profit margin on sales to commercial customers increased from 16.3% to 16.7% primarily due to improved margins in distribution.  
     
   Expeditionary Services Segment   
     
  Sales in the Expeditionary Services segment increased $5.2 million or 7.2% over the prior year period primarily attributable to the sale of four aircraft and related parts in expeditionary airlift services.  The aircraft and other assets sold were previously used on our contract providing vertical replenishment services in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans which expired on November 30, 2016.  
     
  Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment increased $9.3 million with expeditionary airlift services comprising $5.8 million of the increase.  Improved profitability for mobility products, which includes the composite manufacturing product line previously classified as a discontinued operation, also contributed to the increased gross profit in Expeditionary Services.  
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million in fiscal 2017 reflecting increased investments in business development activities.  
     
   Interest Expense   
     
  Interest expense decreased $0.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the retirement of our remaining convertible notes in fiscal 2016.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.6% for the three month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to 35.7% in the prior year period.  
     
   Six-Month Period Ended November 30, 2016   
     
   Aviation Services Segment   
     
  For the six-month period ended November 30, 2016, sales in the Aviation Services segment increased $5.9 million or 0.9% over the prior year period primarily attributable to a $12.1 million or 2.5% increase in sales to commercial customers.  The increase in sales to commercial customers was primarily attributable to improved demand in aftermarket parts trading of $18.9 million and higher volumes in distribution of $10.3 million over the prior year period largely from the continued ramp up of new contracts.  These increases were partially offset by lower sales of $19.0 million at our Lake Charles facility from its transition to a more limited operation.  
     
  Sales in this segment to government and defense customers decreased $6.2 million or 3.1% from the prior year primarily due to lower sales of $17.5 million in distribution.  This was partially offset by higher volumes in programs of $10.6 million primarily related to new contract awards supporting the U.S. Navy s C-40A and the Afghan Air Force s C-130 fleets.

Table of Contents   
     
  Cost of sales in Aviation Services increased $4.6 million or 0.8% over the prior year period which was largely in line with the sales increase discussed above.  Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment increased $1.3 million or 1.2%.  Gross profit in this segment on sales to commercial customers increased $4.5 million or 6.0% over the prior year with the increased volumes in aftermarket parts trading and distribution discussed above contributing the majority of the increase.  Gross profit margin on sales to commercial customers increased from 15.8% to 16.3% primarily due to these increased volumes.  
     
  Gross profit on sales to government and defense customers decreased $3.2 million or 9.8% from the prior year with lower volumes in distribution contributing the majority of the decrease.  Gross profit margin on sales to government and defense customers decreased from 16.4% to 15.3% primarily due to the mix of services provided in programs, including within the KC10 Program.  
     
   Expeditionary Services Segment   
     
  For the six month period ended November 30, 2016, sales in the Expeditionary Services segment increased $4.5 million or 3.2% over the prior year period.  The increase in sales was driven by the aircraft and parts sales discussed above.  Contract positions for our expeditionary airlift services remained stable during the six month periods as new contract positions in the Falkland Islands and Afghanistan were offset by the expiration of other contract positions.  
     
  Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment increased $13.4 million with improved profitability for mobility products contributing the majority of the increased gross profit in Expeditionary Services.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold certain assets related to our temperature-controlled container product line to Sonoco Protective Solutions, Inc. which resulted in a gain of $2.6 million.  
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.0 million in fiscal 2017 primarily attributable to additional investments in business development activities.  
     
   Interest Expense   
     
  Interest expense decreased $1.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of the retirement of our remaining convertible notes in fiscal 2016.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 35.7% for the six month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to 35.4% in the prior year period.  
     
   Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position   
     
  Our operating activities are funded and commitments met through the generation of cash from operations.  Periodically, we may raise capital through common stock and debt financings in the public or private markets.  In addition to these cash sources, our current capital resources include an unsecured credit facility.  We continually evaluate various financing arrangements, including the issuance of common stock or debt, which would allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth on commercially reasonable terms. Our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the overall health of the credit markets, general economic conditions, airline industry conditions, geo-political events, and our operating performance.  Our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and changes in working capital.  
     
  At November 30, 2016, our liquidity and capital resources included cash of $23.0 million and working capital of $550.9 million.

Table of Contents   
     
  We maintain a Revolving Credit Facility with various financial institutions, as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, which provides the Company an aggregate revolving credit commitment amount of $500 million.   The Company, under certain circumstances, may request an increase to the revolving credit commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $250 million, not to exceed $750 million in total.  
     
  On November 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility which extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to November 1, 2021, eliminated the covenant condition of no material adverse effects for credit extensions, and modified certain other provisions.  
     
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate plus 100 to 200 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 0 to 100 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan.  
     
  Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at November 30, 2016 were $129.0 million and there were approximately $14.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced the availability of this facility to $357.0 million.  There are no other terms or covenants limiting the availability of this facility.  We also had $9.3 million available under foreign lines of credit at November 30, 2016.  
     
  We intend to retire current maturities due in the next twelve months through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.  
     
  At November 30, 2016, we complied with all financial and other covenants under each of our financing arrangements.  
     
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
     
  Net cash used in operating activities continuing operations was $0.3 million in the six month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to cash used of $13.9 million in the prior year period.  The improvement from the prior period of $13.6 million was primarily attributable to decreases in inventories and accrued and other liabilities.  
     
  The use of cash of $0.3 million in the six month period ended November 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in equipment on or available for long-term lease of $47.9 million to support new government program awards such as the U.S. Navy s C-40A fleet as well as new flight hour component inventory management and repair programs with commercial airline customers including South African Airways, Air New Zealand, and other operators previously discussed.  
     
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities   
     
  Net cash used in investing activities continuing operations was $3.7 million during the six month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to a use of cash of $4.1 million in the prior year period.  The prior year period included higher capital expenditures, primarily in our Expeditionary Services segment.  During the three month period ended November 30, 2015, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction for an AW-189 rotary-wing aircraft which resulted in proceeds of $19.2 million.  
     
  Net cash provided from investing activities discontinued operations was $27.3 million during the six month period ended November 30, 2015 which included $28.3 of proceeds from contingent consideration from our sale of Telair Cargo Group.  
     
   Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
     
  Net cash used in financing activities continuing operations was $2.8 million during the six month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to cash provided of $0.9 million in the prior year period.  The additional cash used of $3.7 million was primarily attributable to higher treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2017 of $4.7 million compared to the prior year period.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates   
     
  We make a number of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments in the preparation of our financial statements.  See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2016 Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting policies.  There have been no significant changes to the application of our critical accounting policies during fiscal 2017.  
     
   Forward-Looking Statements   
     
  This report contains certain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements are based on beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated, depending on a variety of factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.  Should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described.  Those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  
     
   Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
     
  Our exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates, and credit losses on accounts receivable.  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounts receivable exposure.  
     
   Foreign Currency Risk  .  Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period, and balance sheet accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates.  Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders  equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  A hypothetical 10 percent devaluation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would not have had a material impact on our financial position or continuing operations. 
     
   Interest Rate Risk  .  Refer to the section Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.  There were no significant changes during the quarter ended November 30, 2016. 
     
   Item 4   Controls and Procedures     
     
  As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures.  Therefore, effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of November 30, 2016, ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner.  
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter ended November 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   Item 1   Legal Proceedings     
     
    DynCorp International LLC v. AAR Airlift Group, Inc.    
     
  On November 5, 2015, AAR Airlift Group, Inc.  ( AAR Airlift ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAR CORP. filed with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the  Court ) a motion to dismiss a First Amended Complaint filed by DynCorp International LLC ( DynCorp ) alleging that AAR Airlift misappropriated DynCorp s trade secrets in connection with the submission of proposals pursuant to the solicitation issued by the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation ( INL/A ) in support of the Global Aviation Support Services ( GASS ) program which was subsequently awarded to AAR Airlift on September 1, 2016.  
     
  On January 14, 2016, the Court granted AAR Airlift s motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint.  On February 2, 2016, DynCorp filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the  Court of Appeals ) with respect to the Court s order on the motion to dismiss and other orders issued by the Court in this case.    
     
  On November 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the Court s dismissal of the First Amended Complaint and remanded the case to the Court for further proceedings. The parties have jointly asked the Court to hold a pre-trial conference in the first quarter of 2017 for the purpose of establishing a discovery schedule and addressing other pre-trial matters. AAR Airlift will continue to defend itself vigorously against DynCorp s lawsuit, which it believes it entirely without merit.

  2.

The Registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have: 
     
  a)                Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
     
  b)                Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

  5.                 The Registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
     
  a)                All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
     
  b)                Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
