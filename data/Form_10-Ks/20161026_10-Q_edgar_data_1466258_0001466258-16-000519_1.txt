  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Ingersoll-Rand plc (Plc or Parent Company), a public limited company incorporated in Ireland in 2009, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company), reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) interim reporting requirements. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for full financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Ingersoll-Rand plc Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the condensed consolidated results for the interim periods presented. Certain reclassifications of amounts reported in prior periods have been made to conform with the current period presentation. 
   
  Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than SEC issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) to communicate changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU's. ASU's not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments" (ASU 2015-16) which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively. As a result, adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 and will apply provisions, as applicable, to future acquisitions. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (ASU 2015-03) which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.  ASU 2015-03 is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 and has retrospectively adjusted the prior period presented. This change in classification resulted in a net $  21.2 million   decrease to   Other noncurrent assets   with a corresponding decrease to   Long-term debt   as of December 31, 2015.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement" (ASU 2015-05) which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and how to account for the license under each scenario. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those annual periods. A reporting entity may apply the guidance prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date, or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new guidance did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" (ASU 2016-09) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions.  The guidance makes several modifications to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, ASU 2016-09 clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017 and is currently assessing how the adoption will impact the Company's financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" (ASU 2016-02) which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The standard also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the updated standard on the Company's financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (ASC 606), which creates a comprehensive, five-step model for revenue recognition that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, a company will be required to use more judgment and make more estimates when considering contract terms as well as relevant facts and circumstances when identifying performance obligations, estimating the amount of variable consideration in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In addition, ASC 606 enhances disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. ASC 606 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the standard. The Company is currently determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact of the updated standards on the Company's financial statements. 
   
  Note 3. Inventories 
  Depending on the business, U.S. inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Non-U.S. inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the FIFO method. 
  The major classes of inventory were as follows: 

The Company performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. Reserve balances, primarily related to obsolete and slow-moving inventories, were $  113.8 million   and $  100.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  Note 4. Goodwill 
  The Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Once the final valuation has been performed for each acquisition, adjustments may be recorded. Goodwill is tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit.

  INGERSOLL-RAND PLC 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows:   

  The net goodwill balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include $  2,496.0 million   of accumulated impairment. The accumulated impairment relates entirely to a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 associated with the Climate segment. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company acquired distributors of Industrial products that were previously independently owned. These acquisitions are not considered material for further disclosure. 
   
  Note 5. Intangible Assets 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. All other intangible assets with finite useful lives are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
  The gross amount of the Company s intangible assets and related accumulated amortization were as follows: 

Intangible asset amortization expense was $  33.0 million   and $  36.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Intangible asset amortization expense was   $99.1 million   and   $112.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
   
  Note 6. Debt and Credit Facilities 
  Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt   consisted of the following: 

Commercial Paper Program 
  The Company uses borrowings under its commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $  2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Debentures with Put Feature 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $343.0 million   of fixed rate debentures outstanding which contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date.  If exercised, the Company is obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder s option, the outstanding principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest. If these options are not exercised, the final contractual maturity dates would range between   2027   and   2028  . Holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on   $37.2 million   of the outstanding debentures in February 2016, subject to the notice requirement. No material exercises were made.  
  Long-term debt  , excluding current maturities, consisted of the following:  

Other Credit Facilities 
  The Company maintains two 5-year, $  1.0 billion   revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited and Ingersoll-Rand Luxembourg Finance S.A. (collectively, the Borrowers). Each senior unsecured credit facility, one of which matures in March 2019 and the other in March 2021, provides support for the Company's commercial paper program and can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Ingersoll-Rand plc, Ingersoll-Rand Irish Holdings Unlimited Company, Ingersoll-Rand Lux International Holding Company S. .r.l. and Ingersoll-Rand Company each provide irrevocable and unconditional guarantees for these Facilities.  In addition, each Borrower will guarantee the obligations under the Facilities of the other Borrower. Total commitments of $  2.0 billion   were unused at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Fair Value of Debt  
  The carrying value of the Company's short-term borrowings is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of the Company's debt instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $4.6 billion   and   $4.5 billion  , respectively. The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt instruments for disclosure purposes based upon observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar assets. These fair value inputs are considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its long-term debt instruments at   September 30, 2016   are the same as those used at   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  Note 7. Financial Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors. These fluctuations can increase the cost of financing, investing and operating the business.  The Company may use various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency rate exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
  On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction or as an undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company assesses at inception, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent the derivative is deemed to be a highly effective hedge, the fair market value changes of the instrument are recorded to   Accumulated other comprehensive income   (AOCI). Any ineffective portion of a derivative instrument s change in fair value is recorded in   Net earnings   in the period of change. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains and losses on the derivative instrument will be recorded in   Net earnings  . 
  The fair values of derivative instruments included within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows: 

Asset and liability derivatives included in the table above are recorded within   Other current assets   and   Accrued expenses     and     other current liabilities  , respectively. 
  Currency Derivative Instruments 
  The notional amount of the Company s currency derivatives was $  1.2 billion   and $  1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a net gain of $  2.8 million   and $  0.5 million  , net of tax, respectively, was included in AOCI related to the fair value of the Company s currency derivatives designated as accounting hedges. The amount expected to be reclassified into   Net earnings   over the next twelve months is a gain of $  2.8 million  . The actual amounts that will be reclassified to   Net earnings   may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. Gains and losses associated with the Company s currency derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in   Net earnings   as changes in fair value occur. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum term of the Company s currency derivatives was approximately 12 months.  
  Other Derivative Instruments 
  The Company has utilized forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate locks to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and had a notional amount of $  1.3 billion  . Consequently, when the contracts were settled upon the issuance of the underlying debt, any realized gains or losses in the fair values of the instruments were deferred into   Accumulated other comprehensive income  . These deferred gains or losses are subsequently recognized into   Interest expense   over the term of the related notes. The net unrecognized gain in AOCI was $  5.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $5.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The net deferred gain at   September 30, 2016   will continue to be amortized over the term of notes with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2044. The amount expected to be amortized over the next twelve months is a net loss of $  0.5 million  . The Company has no forward-starting interest rate swaps or interest rate lock contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The counterparties to the Company s forward contracts consist of a number of investment grade major international financial institutions. The Company could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, the credit ratings and the concentration of risk in these financial institutions are monitored on a continuous basis and present no significant credit risk to the Company. 
   
  Note 8. Fair Value Measurements 
  ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement," (ASC 820) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows: 
             
    Level 1:   Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
     
    9 

     Table of Contents  
  INGERSOLL-RAND PLC 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Level 2:   Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
                
    Level 3:   Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  The following table presents the Company s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  :

The following table presents the Company s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  : 

Derivative instruments include forward foreign currency contracts and instruments related to non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. The fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on a pricing model that uses spot rates and forward prices from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable. 
    
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   are the same as those used at   December 31, 2015  .  There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 9. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions 
  The Company sponsors several U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of the Company's U.S. employees. Additionally, the Company has many non-U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering eligible non-U.S. employees. Postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) provide healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees. 
  At December 31, 2015, the Company refined the measurement approach used to calculate service and interest costs for both pension and OPEB obligations to utilize multiple specific spot rates, along the same hypothetical yield curve, that correlate with the timing of the relevant projected cash flows. The Company concluded that this refinement is a change in accounting estimate. 
  Pension Plans 
  The noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non-collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a final average pay formula while plans for most collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula or a percentage of pay formula. The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. The Company also maintains additional other supplemental plans for officers and other key or highly compensated employees.

The components of the Company s net periodic pension benefit cost for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

The Company made contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of $  38.5 million   and $  15.1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company currently projects that it will contribute approximately   $55 million   to its plans worldwide in 2016.  
  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 
  The Company sponsors several postretirement plans that provide for healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits that cover certain eligible employees. These plans are unfunded and have no plan assets, but are instead funded by the Company on a pay-as-you-go basis in the form of direct benefit payments. Generally, postretirement health benefits are contributory with contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory.

Changes in ordinary shares and treasury shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $  1.5 billion   of its ordinary shares under a share repurchase program that began in April 2014. Share repurchases are made from time to time at the discretion of management subject to market conditions, regulatory requirements and other considerations. Shares repurchased prior to October 2014 were canceled upon repurchase and accounted for as a reduction of   Ordinary shares   and   Capital in excess of par value  , or   Retained earnings   to the extent   Capital in excess of par value   was exhausted. Beginning in October 2014, repurchased shares were held in treasury and recognized at cost. Ordinary shares held in treasury are presented separately on the balance sheet as a reduction to   Equity  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   4.9 million   shares for   $250.1 million  . The Company has $  416.6 million   remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization.

  Note 11. Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, "Compensation - Stock Compensation" (ASC 718), which requires a fair-value based method for measuring the value of stock-based compensation. Fair value is measured once at the date of grant and is not adjusted for subsequent changes. The Company s share-based compensation plans include programs for stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share units (PSUs) and deferred compensation. 
  Compensation Expense 
  Share-based compensation expense is related to continuing operations and is included in   Selling and administrative expenses  . The expense recognized for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows:

Stock Options / RSUs 
  Eligible participants may receive (i) stock options, (ii) RSUs or (iii) a combination of both stock options and RSUs. The fair value of each of the Company s stock option and RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the    3  -year vesting period. However, for stock options and RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value at the grant date. Grants issued during the   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

The average fair value of the stock options granted is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following assumptions were used during the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

A description of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards is as follows: 
             
    Volatility   -- The expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the Company s implied volatility and the most recent historical volatility of the Company s stock commensurate with the expected life.  
                
    Risk-free rate of return   -- The Company applies a yield curve of continuous risk-free rates based upon the published U.S. Treasury spot rates on the grant date.   
                
    Expected life   -- The expected life of the Company s stock option awards represents the weighted-average of the actual period since the grant date for all exercised or cancelled options and an expected period for all outstanding options.   
                
    Dividend yield   -- The Company determines the dividend yield based upon the expected quarterly dividend payments as of the grant date and the current fair market value of the Company s stock.   
                
    Forfeiture Rate   -- The Company analyzes historical data of forfeited options to develop a reasonable expectation of the number of options to forfeit prior to vesting per year. This expected forfeiture rate is applied to the Company s ongoing compensation expense; however, all expense is adjusted to reflect actual vestings and forfeitures. 
     Performance Shares 
  The Company has a Performance Share Program (PSP) for key employees. The program provides awards in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs) based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target award level is expressed as a number of the Company's ordinary shares. All PSUs are settled in the form of ordinary shares. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted PSUs with a maximum award level of approximately   0.6 million   shares with a weighted-average fair value per award of $  53.60  . 
  PSU awards are earned based   50%   upon a performance condition, measured at each reporting period by relative EPS growth to the industrial group of companies in the S P 500 Index and the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant, and   50%   upon a market condition, measured by the Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) as compared to the TSR of the industrial group of companies in the S P 500 Index over the 3-year performance period. The fair value of the market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach in a risk-neutral framework based upon historical volatility, risk-free rates and correlation matrix.

  Note 12. Other Income/(Expense), Net 
  The components of   Other income/(expense), net   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30   are as follows: 

During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recognized a loss on foreign currency exchange of $  42.6 million   related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivar. This loss was partially offset by $  14.3 million   of foreign currency transaction gains resulting from the remeasurement of non-functional balance sheet positions into their functional currency. Other activity, net, in each period presented, primarily consists of insurance settlements on asbestos-related matters and the revaluation of asbestos recoveries. 
  Sale of Hussmann Equity Investment  
  During 2011, the Company completed the sale of a controlling interest of its Hussmann refrigerated display case business ( Hussmann ) to a newly-formed affiliate ( Hussmann Parent ) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier   Rice, LLC ( CD R ).  Per the terms of the agreement, CD R s ownership interest in Hussmann at the acquisition date was 60% with the remaining 40% being retained by the Company.  As a result, the Company accounted for its interest in Hussmann using the equity method of accounting. 
  On December 21, 2015, the Company announced it would sell its remaining equity interest in Hussmann as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann's outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of $  422.5 million  , including closing settlement amounts, for its interest and recognized a gain of $  397.8 million   on the sale.

Note 13. Income Taxes 
  The Company accounts for its provision for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes," which requires an estimate of the annual effective income tax rate for the full year to be applied to the respective interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company's effective income tax rate was   14.8  % and   50.2  %, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the tax treatment of the Hussmann gain. The gain, which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws, decreased the effective tax rate by   5.5%  .  In addition, the reduction was driven by the provision to return true-up due to the filing of the U.S. Federal income tax return, the reduction of a previously accrued tax liability due to obtaining a certification from a local non-U.S. tax authority and by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. The effective income tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to the increase in the Company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS agreement, partially offset by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. The increase in the Company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS agreement increased the effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   by   24.1%  . 
  Total unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were $  167.5 million   and $  174.9 million  , respectively. Although management believes its tax positions and related provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements are fully supportable, it recognizes that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities. These tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available, including progress on tax audits, changes in interpretations of tax laws, developments in case law and closing of statute of limitations.  To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in   Provision for income taxes  . 
  The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United States. In general, the examination of the Company s material tax returns is complete for the years prior to 2003, with certain matters being resolved through appeals and litigation. 
   
  Note 14. Discontinued Operations 
  The Company has retained costs from previously sold businesses that mainly include expenses related to postretirement benefits, product liability and legal costs (mostly asbestos related). The components of   Discontinued operations, net of tax   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Pre-tax earnings from discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   mainly consists of income realized from settlements with insurance carriers related to asbestos. Refer to Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," for more information regarding asbestos-related matters. The lower net tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily relates to a benefit realized from the resolution of a state income tax matter.

Note 15. Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing   Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc   by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which in the Company s case, includes shares issuable under share-based compensation plans. The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Note 16. Business Segment Information 
  The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the operating segments  results are prepared on a management basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company prepares financial information for internal review and decision making. The Company largely evaluates performance based on Segment operating income and Segment operating margins. Intercompany sales between segments are considered immaterial. 
  The Company's Climate segment globally delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services. It includes Trane        and American Standard        Heating   Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; energy services and building automation through Trane Building Advantage and Nexia; and Thermo King        transport temperature control solutions.  
  The Company's Industrial segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes compressed air and gas systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, ARO        fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car         golf, utility and rough terrain vehicles. 
  Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company's chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, the Company believes that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss.  
  A summary of operations by reportable segment for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30   was as follows: 

Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos, and product liability matters. In accordance with ASC 450, "Contingencies," the Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably

estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. 
  The Company is currently a defendant to a lawsuit originally filed by a customer in 2012 relating to a commercial HVAC contract entered into in 2001, prior to the acquisition of Trane U.S. Inc. (Trane) by Ingersoll Rand.  The lawsuit has been amended several times, most recently in April 2016. The plaintiff seeks economic damages of $  71.6 million   for remediation costs and contractual claims, as well as treble damages.  The Company believes the claim is without merit and denies liability.  Trial is currently scheduled to begin in January 2017 in the Texas state court.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not accrued any material amount related to this matter.   
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company continues to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, the Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities. 
  The Company is sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and has received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, the Company s involvement is minimal. 
  In estimating its liability, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on the Company's understanding of the parties  financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $  41.2 million   and $  43.8 million  , respectively. Of these amounts, $  35.4 million   and $  35.5 million  , respectively, relate to remediation of sites previously disposed of by the Company.  
  Asbestos-Related Matters 
  Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims have been filed against either Ingersoll-Rand Company or Trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by Ingersoll-Rand Company or Trane, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. Neither Ingersoll-Rand Company nor Trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. 
  The Company engages an outside expert to assist in calculating an estimate of the Company s total liability for pending and unasserted future asbestos-related claims and annually performs a detailed analysis with the assistance of an outside expert to update its estimated asbestos-related liability. The methodology used to project the Company s total liability for pending and unasserted potential future asbestos-related claims relied upon and included the following factors, among others: 
             
    the outside expert s interpretation of a widely accepted forecast of the population likely to have been occupationally exposed to asbestos; 
                
    epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer; 
                
    the Company s historical experience with the filing of non-malignancy claims and claims alleging other types of malignant diseases filed against the Company relative to the number of lung cancer claims filed against the Company; 
                
    the outside expert s analysis of the number of people likely to file an asbestos-related personal injury claim against the Company based on such epidemiological and historical data and the Company s most recent three-year claims history; 
                
    an analysis of the Company s pending cases, by type of disease claimed and by year filed; 
                
    an analysis of the Company s most recent three-year history to determine the average settlement and resolution value of claims, by type of disease claimed;

an adjustment for inflation in the future average settlement value of claims, at a   2.5%   annual inflation rate, adjusted downward to   1.5%   to take account of the declining value of claims resulting from the aging of the claimant population; and 
                
    an analysis of the period over which the Company has and is likely to resolve asbestos-related claims against it in the future. 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , over   80 percent   of the open claims against the Company are non-malignancy or unspecified disease claims, many of which have been placed on inactive or deferral dockets and the vast majority of which have little or no settlement value against the Company, particularly in light of recent changes in the legal and judicial treatment of such claims. 
  The Company s liability for asbestos-related matters and the asset for probable asbestos-related insurance recoveries were included in the following balance sheet accounts: 

The Company's asbestos insurance receivable related to Ingersoll-Rand Company and Trane was $  131.6 million   and $  146.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and $  166.4 million   and $  149.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The (costs) income associated with the settlement and defense of asbestos-related claims after insurance recoveries for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Income and expenses associated with Ingersoll-Rand Company's asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within discontinued operations, as they relate to previously divested businesses, primarily Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, which was sold by the Company in 2000. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reached settlements with various insurance carriers related to Ingersoll-Rand Company asbestos matters. Income and expenses associated with Trane s asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within   Other income/(expense), net   as part of continuing operations. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company reached a settlement with an insurance carrier related to Trane asbestos matters. 
  The receivable attributable to Trane for probable insurance recoveries as of   September 30, 2016   is entirely supported by settlement agreements between Trane and the respective insurance carriers. Most of these settlement agreements constitute  coverage-in-place  arrangements, in which the insurer signatories agree to reimburse Trane for specified portions of its costs for asbestos bodily injury claims and Trane agrees to certain claims-handling protocols and grants to the insurer signatories certain releases and indemnifications.  
  In 2012 and 2013, Ingersoll-Rand Company filed actions in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, seeking a declaratory judgment and other relief regarding the Company s rights to defense and indemnity for asbestos claims. The defendants were several dozen solvent insurance companies, including companies that had been paying a portion of Ingersoll-Rand Company s asbestos claim defense and indemnity costs. The responding defendants generally challenged the Company s right to recovery, and raised various coverage defenses. Since filing the actions, Ingersoll-Rand Company has settled with half of the insurer defendants, and has dismissed one of the actions in its entirety.

The Company continually monitors the status of pending litigation that could impact the allocation of asbestos claims against the Company's various insurance policies. The Company has concluded that its Ingersoll-Rand Company insurance receivable is probable of recovery because of the following factors: 
             
    Ingersoll-Rand Company has reached favorable settlements regarding asbestos coverage claims for the majority of its recorded asbestos-related insurance receivable; 
                
    a review of other companies in circumstances comparable to Ingersoll-Rand Company, including Trane, and the success of other companies in recovering under their insurance policies, including Trane's favorable settlements referenced above; 
                
    the Company's confidence in its right to recovery under the terms of its policies and pursuant to applicable law; and 
                
    the Company's history of receiving payments under the Ingersoll-Rand Company insurance program, including under policies that had been the subject of prior litigation. 
     The amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on currently available information. The Company s actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results. Key variables in these assumptions include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolution of each such new claim, the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers, and the solvency risk with respect to the Company s insurance carriers. Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. Other factors that may affect the Company s liability include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and federal courts, and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation. 
  The aggregate amount of the stated limits in insurance policies available to the Company for asbestos-related claims acquired over many years and from many different carriers, is substantial. However, limitations in that coverage, primarily due to the considerations described above, are expected to result in the projected total liability to claimants substantially exceeding the probable insurance recovery. 
  Warranty Liability 
  Standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.    
  The changes in the standard product warranty liability for the   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Standard product warranty liabilities are classified as   Accrued expenses     and     other current liabilities   or   Other noncurrent liabilities   based on their expected term. The Company's total current standard product warranty reserve at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  148.4 million   and $  152.6 million  , respectively. 
  The Company's extended warranty liability represents the deferred revenue associated with its extended warranty contracts and is amortized into   Net revenues   on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liability by evaluating the expected costs under its existing contracts to ensure these expected costs do not exceed the extended warranty liability.

    An intercompany loan of $  19.5 billion   was made from Irish Holdings to Lux International and was subsequently reduced to $  18.0 billion  . 
     These transactions had no impact on the composition of the Company s consolidated group and had no effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements for any period.

Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Part II, Item 1A   Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; and under Part I, Item 1A   Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Overview 
  Organizational 
  We are a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate and Industrial, both with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Ingersoll-Rand       , Trane       , Thermo King       , American Standard       , ARO       ,       and Club Car       . 
  To achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts, service, used equipment and rentals; and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our high-potential businesses. Additional emphasis is placed on expanding market coverage in terms of geography or by taking advantage of a particular vertical market or opportunity. We also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows. 
  Trends and Economic Events 
  We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolios, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results.  
  Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. We regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we are serving to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly. In addition, we believe our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy.  
  Current economic conditions remain challenging across each of the segments in which we participate.  Residential and Commercial new construction has seen moderate growth in the United States which is positively impacting the results of our Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) businesses. Non-residential new construction continues to grow slowly in Europe and Asia. In addition, HVAC equipment replacement and aftermarket continue to experience steady growth. However, we have seen slower worldwide industrial equipment activity, which is slightly offset by continued growth in services.  As economic conditions stabilize, we expect slow to moderate growth in global construction markets and weak industrial markets, along with benefits from continued productivity programs. 
  Despite the current market environment, we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity, coupled with our large installed product base, provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth. 
  Significant Events in the Period 
  On December 21, 2015, we announced the sale of our remaining equity interest in the Hussmann refrigerated display case business ( Hussmann ) as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann's outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. We received net proceeds of $  422.5 million  , including closing settlement amounts, for our interest and recognized a gain of $  397.8 million   on the sale.  
  In October 2016, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.32 to $0.40 per ordinary share.  It reflects  a 25% increase that will begin with our December 2016 payment.  In February 2016, we increased our quarterly share dividend from $0.29 to $0.32 per ordinary share.

Results of Operations 
  Our Climate segment globally delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services. It includes Trane        and American Standard        Heating   Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; energy services and building automation through Trane Building Advantage and Nexia; and Thermo King        transport temperature control solutions.  
  Our Industrial segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes compressed air and gas systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, ARO        fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car         golf, utility and rough terrain vehicles. 
  Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues. 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015   

  Net Revenues 
  Net revenues   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   2.3%  , or   $80.9 million  , compared with the same period in   2015  , which resulted from the following: 

The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in our Climate segment.  In addition, improved pricing and incremental revenues associated with acquisitions within each segment further contributed to the year-over-year increase. These amounts were partially offset by flat volumes in our Industrial segment and overall unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.

Our revenues by segment for the three month period ended   September 30   are as follows: 

Climate 
  Net revenues   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   2.9%   or $  79.9 million  , compared with the same period of 2015. The components of the period change are as follows: 

The primary driver of the increase related to incremental volumes in both the Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC businesses. Commercial HVAC results reflect continued improvements in service and parts while Residential HVAC results increased with with strong order growth and improved pricing. In addition, revenues associated with acquisitions added incremental volume during the current period. The increase was partially offset by lower volumes in our transport refrigeration business and overall unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
  Industrial 
  Net revenues   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   0.1%   or $  1.0 million  , compared with the same period of   2015  . The components of the period change are as follows: 

The primary driver of the increase related to improved pricing and incremental revenues associated with acquisitions. However, these improvements were offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Overall volumes in the segment were flat compared with the prior year due to the continued weakness in the industrial markets. 
  Operating Income/Margin 
  Operating margin increased from   13.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   14.1%   for the same period in   2016  . The increase was primarily the result of pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.5%) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.2%). These amounts were partially offset by increased investment spending (0.1%) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.1%).

     Table of Contents  

Climate 
  Operating margin improved to   16.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   15.5%   for the same period of 2015. The improvement was primarily the result of pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.5%), favorable product mix and volume (0.4%) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.3%), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.1%). 
  Industrial 
  Operating margin decreased to   10.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   13.9%   for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volume/product mix (1.9%), decreased productivity in excess of other inflation (1.0%), increased investment and restructuring spending (0.5%) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.2%). These amounts were partially offset by pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.6%). 
  Unallocated Corporate Expenses 
  Unallocated corporate expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   (12.6)%   or $  6.9 million  , compared with the same period of 2015.  The decrease in expenses primarily relates to reductions in professional expenses as well as the timing of general corporate expenses. 
  Interest Expense 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016     and   September 30, 2015   Interest expense   was $  54.5 million   and $  55.8 million  . 
  Other Income/(Expense), Net 
  The components of   Other income/(expense), net   for the three months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Sale of Hussmann Equity Investment 
  During 2011, we completed the sale of a controlling interest of its Hussmann refrigerated display case business ( Hussmann ) to a newly-formed affiliate ( Hussmann Parent ) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier   Rice, LLC ( CD R ).  Per the terms of the agreement, CD R s ownership interest in Hussmann at the acquisition date was 60% with the remaining 40% being retained by the Company.  As a result, we accounted for our interest in Hussmann using the equity method of accounting. 
  On December 21, 2015, we announced we would sell our remaining equity interest in Hussmann as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann's outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. We received net proceeds of $  422.5 million   for our interest and recognized a gain of $  397.8 million   on the sale.  
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate was   18.5  % which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily driven by the provision to return true-up due to the filing of the U.S. Federal income tax return, the reduction of a previously accrued tax liability due to obtaining a certification from a local non-U.S. tax authority and by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effective tax rate was   26.4%  , which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by a net increase to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a non-cash charge for the true-up of certain income tax receivables.  Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions account for approximately 38% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate.

Net Revenues 
  Net revenues   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   1.8%  , or   $175.2 million  , compared with the same period in   2015  , which resulted from the following: 

The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in our Climate segment. Improved pricing, along with incremental revenues from acquisitions, further contributed to the year-over-year increase in each segment. These amounts were partially offset by lower volumes in our Industrial segment and overall unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.  
  Our revenues by segment for the   nine   month period ended   September 30   are as follows: 

Climate 
  Net revenues   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   3.3%   or $  254.2 million  , compared with the same period of 2015. The components of the period change are as follows: 

The primary driver of the increase related to incremental volumes in both the Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC businesses. Commercial HVAC results reflect continued improvements in equipment, parts and service while Residential HVAC results increased with strong order growth and improved pricing. In addition, revenues associated with acquisitions added incremental

     Table of Contents  

volume during the current period. Improvements in price across the majority of our businesses further contributed to segment results. However, overall revenue improvements were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
  Industrial 
  Net revenues   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   3.5%   or $  79.0 million  , compared with the same period of 2015. The components of the period change are as follows: 

The primary driver of the decrease related to lower overall volumes in the majority of our businesses due to continued weakness in the industrial markets. Segment results were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. However, the decline was partially offset by improvements in pricing within the majority of our businesses as well as incremental revenue provided by acquisitions.   
  Operating Income/Margin 
  Operating margin increased from   11.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   12.1%   for the same period in   2016  . The increase was primarily the result of pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (1.1%), non-recurrence of acquisition related step-up amortization (0.2%), productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.2%) and favorable product mix and volume (0.1%). These amounts were partially offset by a combination of  investment and restructuring spending (0.3%), capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development that were reclassified to the income statement (0.1%) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.1%). 

Climate 
  Operating margin improved to   14.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   12.7%   for the same period of 2015. The improvement was primarily the result of pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (1.2%), favorable product mix and volume (0.7%) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.5%), partially offset by increased investment and restructuring spending (0.2%) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.1%).  
  Industrial 
  Operating margin decreased to   9.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   11.9%   for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volume/product mix (2.5%), increased investment and restructuring spending (0.5%), capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development that were reclassified to the income statement (0.5%), decreased productivity in excess of other inflation (0.2%) and unfavorable foreign currency impacts (0.2%). These amounts were partially offset by non-recurrence of acquisition related step-up amortization (0.9%) and pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.8%). 
  Unallocated Corporate Expenses 
  Unallocated corporate expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   9.8%   or $  14.7 million  , compared with the same period of 2015.  The increase in expenses primarily relates to lower compensation and benefit charges related to variable compensation during 2015.  In addition, higher restructuring charges impacted the current period.  
  Interest Expense 
  
    37 

     Table of Contents  

Interest expense   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased $  1.0 million   compared with the same period of   2015  . The increase relates to changes in short term financing arrangements and other items.   
  Other Income/(Expense), Net 
  The components of    Other income/(expense), net   for the   nine   months ended   September 30   are as follows: 

During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recognized a loss on foreign currency exchange of $  42.6 million   related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan bolivar. This loss was partially offset by $  14.3 million   of foreign currency transaction gains resulting from the remeasurement of non-functional balance sheet positions into their functional currency. Other activity, net, in each period presented, primarily consists of insurance settlements on asbestos related matters and the revaluation of asbestos recoveries. 
  Sale of Hussmann Equity Investment 
  During 2011, we completed the sale of a controlling interest of its Hussmann refrigerated display case business ( Hussmann ) to a newly-formed affiliate ( Hussmann Parent ) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier   Rice, LLC ( CD R ).  Per the terms of the agreement, CD R s ownership interest in Hussmann at the acquisition date was 60% with the remaining 40% being retained by the Company.  As a result, we accounted for our interest in Hussmann using the equity method of accounting. 
  On December 21, 2015, we announced we would sell our remaining equity interest in Hussmann as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann's outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. We received net proceeds of $  422.5 million   for our interest and recognized a gain of $  397.8 million   on the sale.  
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate was   14.8  % which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the tax treatment of the Hussmann gain. The gain, which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws, decreased the effective tax rate by   5.5%  . In addition, the reduction was driven by the provision to return true-up due to the filing of the U.S. Federal income tax return, the reduction of a previously accrued tax liability due to obtaining a certification from a local non-U.S. tax authority and by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate.   For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effective tax rate was   50.2  %, which is higher than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% due to the increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS agreement. The IRS agreement increased our effective tax rate by 24.1%. This was partially offset by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate.  Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions account for approximately 38% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In doing so, we review and analyze our current cash on hand, the number of days our sales are outstanding, inventory turns, capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments. Our cash requirements primarily consist of the following: 

Funding of working capital 
                
    Funding of capital expenditures 
                
    Debt service requirements 
     Our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, proceeds from debt offerings, commercial paper, and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities. We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S., the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed  
  
    38 

     Table of Contents  

credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations will be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $  1,504.6 million   of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $904.0 million was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are either generally available for use in our U.S. operations via intercompany loans or equity infusions or we intend to permanently reinvest them in our non-U.S. operations. We currently have no plans to repatriate permanently reinvested funds to fund our U.S. operations. However, if we decided to repatriate such funds to our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable U.S. (and non-U.S.) taxes. 
  In October 2016, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.32 to $0.40 per ordinary share.  It reflects a 25% increase that will begin with our December 2016 payment.  In February 2016, we increased our quarterly share dividend from $0.29 to $0.32 per ordinary share. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $  1.5 billion   of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the previous share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program began in April of 2014. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased and settled   4.9 million   shares for   $250.1 million  . We have $  416.6 million   remaining on the authorized plan as of   September 30, 2016  . We expect our available cash flow, committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases.  
  Liquidity 
  The following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended: 

Short-term borrowings   and   current maturities of long-term debt   consisted of the following: 

Commercial Paper Program 
  We use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $  2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Debentures with Put Feature 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $343.0 million   of fixed rate debentures outstanding which contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date.  If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder s option, the outstanding principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest. If these options are not exercised, the final contractual maturity dates would range between   2027   and   2028  . Holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on   $37.2 million   of the outstanding debentures in February 2016, subject to the notice requirement. No material exercises were made.

Other Credit Facilities 
  We maintain two 5-year, $  1.0 billion   revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited and Ingersoll-Rand Luxembourg Finance S.A. (collectively, the Borrowers). Each senior unsecured credit facility, one of which matures in March 2019 and the other in March 2021, provides support for the Company's commercial paper program and can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Ingersoll-Rand plc, Ingersoll-Rand Irish Holdings Unlimited Company, Ingersoll-Rand Lux International Holding Company S. .r.l. and Ingersoll-Rand Company each provide irrevocable and unconditional guarantees for these Facilities.  In addition, each Borrower will guarantee the obligations under the Facilities of the other Borrower. Total commitments of $  2.0 billion   were unused at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30  . For additional details, see the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,008.3 million  , of which net income provided $1,220.9 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions.   Changes in assets and liabilities, net   used $  212.6 million  . Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $280.2 million  , of which net income provided $831.0 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions.   Changes in assets and liabilities, net   used $  550.8 million   ($365.2 million after adjusting for the $185.6 million net impact of the IRS agreement). The year over year increase reflects the Company s continued focus on working capital management and improved earnings. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by continuing investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $288.4 million  , compared with net cash used in continuing investing activities of   $1,110.5 million   during the comparable period of   2015  . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the sale of our Hussmann equity interest in April 2016 compared with the January 2015 acquisition of the Engineered Centrifugal Compression business for approximately $850 million and the March 2015 acquisition of FRIGOBLOCK for approximately  100 million (approximately $113 million). 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in continuing financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $631.6 million  , compared with net cash used in continuing financing activities of   $76.1 million   during the comparable period of   2015  . The change in financing activities is primarily driven by the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper balance during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the net proceeds from short term borrowings, primarily commercial paper, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Discontinued Operations 
  Net cash provided by discontinued operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $94.1 million  , compared with net cash used in discontinued operating activities of   $27.2 million   during the comparable period of   2015  . The change in discontinued operating activities is primarily driven by settlements reached with various insurance carriers related to Ingersoll-Rand Company asbestos matters. 
  Pensions 
  Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. We use a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases as the plan's funded status improves. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. 
  
    40 

     Table of Contents  

We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  For a further discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, refer to Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to asbestos, environmental, and product liability matters. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in Note 17 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, management believes that the liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
  Management believes there have been no significant policy changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

    the strategic acquisition of businesses, product lines and joint ventures; and 
                
    the possible effects on us of future legislation in the U.S. that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from our incorporation in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, such as Ireland.  
     Some of the significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections are described more fully in the  Risk Factors  section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . There may also be other factors that have not been anticipated or that are not described in our periodic filings with the SEC, generally because we did not believe them to be significant at the time, which could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. 
   
  Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk as of the   third   quarter of   2016  .  
   
  Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
  The Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of   September 30, 2016  , that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information required to be filed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported when required and the information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1   Legal Proceedings 
  In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, including commercial and contract disputes, employment matters, product liability claims, asbestos-related claims, environmental liabilities, intellectual property disputes, and tax-related matters. In our opinion, pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. 
  The Company is currently a defendant to a lawsuit originally filed by a customer in 2012 relating to a commercial HVAC contract entered into in 2001, prior to the acquisition of Trane by Ingersoll Rand. The lawsuit has been amended several times, most recently in April 2016. The plaintiff seeks economic damages of $71.6 million for remediation costs and contractual claims, as well as treble damages.  The Company believes the claim is without merit and denies liability.  Trial is currently scheduled to begin in January 2017 in the Texas state court.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not accrued any material amount related to this matter.   
  Asbestos-Related Matters 
  Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims has been filed against either Ingersoll-Rand Company or Trane and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by Ingersoll-Rand Company or Trane, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. Neither Ingersoll-Rand Company nor Trane was a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. 
  See also the discussion contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015   under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Environmental and Asbestos Matters and also Note 17 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 1A   Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to our risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . For a further discussion of our Risk Factors, refer to the  Risk Factors  discussion contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Item 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The following table provides information with respect to purchases by the Company of its ordinary shares during the   third   quarter of   2016  : 

(a) In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program, which began in April 2014. Based on market conditions, share repurchases are made from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management. The repurchase program does not have a prescribed expiration date. 
  (b) We may also reacquire shares outside of the repurchase program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of share based awards. In such transactions, we reacquired 1,415 shares in August.
