The

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   

The
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies of CTD Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company )
that affect the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

(a)
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  The Company was incorporated in August 1990, as a Florida corporation with operations
beginning in July 1992. We are a biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease.
We have filed a Type II Drug Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for our lead drug candidate,
Trappsol  Cyclo  as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease ( NPC ), and recently filed an Investigational
New Drug application (IND) with the FDA which describes our Phase I clinical plans in the US. The Company has also filed a Clinical
Trial Application with the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and launched an International
Clinical Program for Trappsol  Cyclo .  

While
we also sell cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in
diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development, our core business has transitioned
to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of
disease from a business which had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products.   

(b)
BASIS OF PRESENTATION  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  

Operating
results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  

(c)
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and any highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.  

(d)
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  Accounts receivable are unsecured and non-interest bearing and stated at the amount we expect
to collect from outstanding balances. Based on our assessment of the credit history with customers having outstanding balances
and current relationships with them, we have concluded that losses on balances outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 will be immaterial.  

(e)
INVENTORY AND COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD  Inventory consists of our pharmaceutical drug Trappsol  Cyclo ,
cyclodextrin products and chemical complexes purchased for resale recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net
realizable. Cost of products sold includes the acquisition cost of the products sold and does not include any allocation of inbound or
outbound freight charges, indirect overhead expenses, warehouse and distribution expenses, or depreciation and amortization
expense.

   SEPTEMBER

(f)
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is
computed using primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to five
years for computers and vehicles, seven to ten years for machinery and furniture, fifteen years for certain land
improvements, and forty years for buildings and building improvements). We periodically review our long-lived assets to
determine if the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. If an impairment is identified, we recognize a loss for the
difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset (see Note 2).  

(g)
REVENUE RECOGNITION  We recognize revenue from product sales, royalties, and drying services rendered when the following
four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Product sales and shipping
revenues, net of any discounts or return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.
Sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery
to the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue, have been historically infrequent, and are recorded when they
become known. Amounts received in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have
been met. There is no deferred revenue at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

(h)
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  

(i)
INCOME TAXES  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In addition, tax benefits related to positions considered
uncertain are recognized only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.  

(j)
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  Basic and fully diluted net loss per common share is computed using a simple weighted average
of common shares outstanding during the periods presented, as outstanding warrants to purchase 9,057,500 and 577,500 common shares
were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and have been excluded from the
calculation of loss per common share.  

(k)
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  The Company periodically awards stock to employees, directors, and consultants. An expense
is recognized equal to the fair value of the stock determined using the closing trading price of the stock on the award date.  

(l)
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  Significant concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments owned by the
Company are as follows:  

(i)
DEMAND AND CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSITS  We maintain bank accounts in Federal credit unions and other financial institutions,
which are insured up to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The bank accounts may exceed Federally insured levels;
however, we have not experienced any losses in such accounts.  

(ii)
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  Our accounts receivable consist of amounts due primarily from chemical supply and pharmaceutical
companies located primarily in the United States. Three customers accounted for 94% of the accounts receivable balance at September 30,
2016. Five customers accounted for 89% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015. We have no policy requiring collateral
or other security to support our accounts receivable.

(m) LIQUIDITY  For the year ended December
31, 2015, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $2,551,000 and used net cash in operations in the amount of approximately
$1,989,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,391,865, used net cash in operations
in the amount of $2,386,557, and received net proceeds of $1,880,000 from the sale of its securities. At September 30, 2016,
the Company had a cash balance of $1,270,046, current assets of $2,018,552 and current liabilities of $875,948. The Company seeks
to raise capital from time to time through the sale of its common stock and other securities. In the event that the Company cannot
raise sufficient capital when required, management may have to reduce expenditures related to its operations. 

(n)
USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience
and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could significantly differ from these
estimates.  

(o) NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued various Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs), including ASU 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, as subsequently amended; ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern; ASU 2015-17,
Income Taxes; and ASU 2016-02, Leases, which are effective in future fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of these standards
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation
of Interest (Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs), and reclassified net deferred financing costs of $64,801 from
noncurrent assets as a reduction of the associated notes payable balance as of September 30, 2016. This change reduced noncurrent
assets and liabilities by $64,801. There was no change in the net loss for the periods presented as a result of this reclassification.
The Company also reclassified certain items on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet to be consistent with the current presentation. 

(2)
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE   

The
Company has offered for sale its office and manufacturing facility in Alachua, Florida, which includes its pulse dryer. Accordingly,
these assets have been reclassified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. As a result,
an impairment loss of $810,000 has been identified and recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The impairment
loss is equal to the difference between the former carrying amount and the current estimated market value of $963,000 for these
assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company determined the fair value of its High Springs property
was less than its carrying value and therefore recorded an impairment loss of $125,000 to adjust the carrying value to $275,000.
The High Springs property was sold in January 2016 (see Note 3 below).  

(3)
MORTGAGE NOTE RECEIVABLE   

On
January 21, 2016, the Company sold its real property located in High Springs, Florida to an unrelated party. This property
was previously classified on our balance sheet as property held for sale, with a carrying value of $275,000. Pursuant to the
terms of the sale, at the closing, the buyer paid $10,000 in cash, less selling costs and settlement charges, and delivered
to the Company a promissory note in the principal amount of $265,000, and a mortgage in our favor securing the buyer s
obligations under the promissory note. The promissory note provides for monthly payments of $3,653, including principal and
interest at 4.25%, over a seven-year period commencing March 1, 2016, with the unpaid balance due in February 2023.  Scheduled
debt principal collections on this mortgage for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS    

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The
Company accounts for the fair value of financial investments in accordance with FASB ASC No. 820  Fair Value Measurements 
(ASC No. 820). ASC No. 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (i.e. exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC No. 820 requires
disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the
assumptions (i.e. inputs) used in the valuation. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. The ASC No. 820 fair value hierarchy is defined as follows:  

Level 1 Valuations are based on unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2 Valuations are based on quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for which significant inputs
are observable, either directly or indirectly.   

Level 3 Valuations are based on prices or valuation
techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Inputs reflect
management s best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability at the measurement date.   

The
following table represents the Company s financial assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value at September 30,
2016.  

The
level 3 non-recurring fair value investment represents a mortgage note receivable (see Note 2). The carrying amount of the mortgage
note receivable approximates fair value because the stated interest rate approximates current market interest rates.  

(5)
DEBT   

The Company owed $500,667 and $516,685, at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, on a mortgage note payable, collateralized by land and a building acquired in September
2010. Monthly payments of $3,506, including principal and interest at 3.99%, are due, with a final balloon payment of approximately
$350,000 due in July 2023. The note is secured by a mortgage on the Company s Alachua property. The note has a voluntary
prepayment penalty which was 2% of the principal repaid as of the date of this filing in the event of a refinancing, and which
decreases 1% on July 17 of each year. The Company was not in compliance with a debt coverage ratio covenant for the year ended
December 31, 2015. As a result, the principal due in 2016 and beyond one year has been reclassified as current in the accompanying
balance sheet. 

The
Company also owed this lender $172,366 and $203,052 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, under an equipment
loan related to the installation of a pulse dryer and related building renovations. Monthly payments of $4,051, including principal
and interest at 3.99%, are due through and including July 2020. The note is collateralized by all of the Company s equipment.
There is a prepayment penalty of 2% of the outstanding balance if the Company voluntarily repays the loan prior to July 17, 2018.
Principal due under this loan has also been reclassified as current in the accompanying balance sheet due to the Company s
non-compliance with the loan covenant referred to above.  

Notes payable has been
reduced by capitalized deferred financing costs of $64,801 and $66,424 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Scheduled
debt obligations on both loans for the next five years and thereafter are as follows, assuming the bank does not call the loans
due to the debt covenant non-compliance:

SALES CONCENTRATIONS:   

Sales
to two major customers accounted for 52% of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Sales to one major customer
accounted for 34% of total sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. A loss of one of these customers could have
a significant adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Overview   

CTD
Holdings, Inc. ( we   our   us  or  the Company ) was organized as a Florida corporation
on August 9, 1990, with operations beginning in July 1992. In conjunction with a restructuring in 2000, we changed our name from
Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc., or CTDI, to CTD Holdings, Inc.; CTDI was then incorporated as a Florida corporation
and became a wholly owned subsidiary of CTD Holdings, Inc.  

We
are a biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease. We have filed a Type II Drug
Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol  Cyclo 
as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease ( NPC ), and recently filed an Investigational New Drug application
( IND ) with the FDA which describes our Phase I clinical plans for a randomized, double blind, parallel group study
at a single clinical site in the US. We have also filed a Clinical Trial Application with the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare
Products Regulatory Agency, and launched an International Clinical Program for Trappsol  Cyclo .  

While
we also sell cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in
diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development, our core business has transitioned
to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of
disease from a business which had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products.  On August 5, 2016, we listed
for sale our real property (which includes our pulse dryer) located in Alachua, Florida. In the event we are able to complete
the sale of this property, we expect to repay our secured loans. Although we expect to continue to operate our cyclodextrin distribution
business following such sale, our strategy going forward is to focus on biopharmaceutical opportunities in healthcare where we
believe cyclodextrin applications have maximum value.  

Substantially
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of cyclodextrins, including bio-pharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins, cyclodextrin
complexes, resale of cyclodextrins manufactured by others for our clients to their specifications, and our own licensed cyclodextrin
products.  We have trademarked certain products under our Trappsol , Aquaplex , and AP -Flavor product
lines.  We currently sell our products directly to customers in the diagnostics, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical
industries, and to chemical supply distributors.    

Trappsol 
Cyclo    

At
the end of 2008, we provided Trappsol  Cyclo  to a customer for compassionate use as an Investigational New Drug to
treat a set of twins in the U.S. who were diagnosed with NPC, also known as Childhood Alzheimer s. NPC is a fatal disease
caused by a genetic defect that prevents proper handling of cholesterol in the body s cells. The patient s treatment
with our Trappsol  Cyclo  product proved to provide an ameliorative benefit. On May 17, 2010, the FDA granted orphan
drug status to our customer for Trappsol  Cyclo  for the treatment of NPC. To date, Trappsol  Cyclo  has been
administered to approximately 20 NPC patients in compassionate use programs around the world, including in the U.S., Brazil and
Spain. Our annual sales of Trappsol  Cyclo  decreased to $352,000 for 2015 from $901,000 for 2014. Sales of Trappsol 
Cyclo  were $21,000 and $401,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In 2012, we began
to offer 100ml vials of Trappsol  Cyclo  in a liquid form from a contract manufacturer. In 2014, we completed validation
of the Trappsol  Cyclo  manufacturing process and submitted a Type II Drug Master File to the FDA. In 2015 we established
an International Clinical Program that includes a team of experienced drug development companies and individuals. We have also
obtained Orphan Drug Designation for Trappsol  Cyclo  in both the U.S. and Europe.  

Most
recently, we obtained regulatory approval of both the IND we filed with the FDA for Trappsol  Cyclo  as a treatment
for NPC, and the Clinical Trial Application we filed with the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.
As a result, we expect to conduct multiple U.S. and international clinical studies in which we will provide Trappsol  Cyclo 
intravenously to NPC patients in order to track biochemical markers of cholesterol metabolism and to measure effects on neurologic,
lung and liver symptoms.  

Resale
of Cyclodextrin and Cyclodextrin Complexes   

Our
sales of cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin complexes are primarily to chemical supply houses around the world, to pharmaceutical
companies, to food companies for research and development and to diagnostics companies.  

We
acquire our products principally from outside the United States, including from Wacker Biosolutions, a division of Wacker Chemie
AG (Germany), with a production facility located in Adrian, Michigan and Hangzhou Pharma and Chem Co. (China), Quian Hui (China),
and Cyclodextrin Research   Development Laboratory (Hungary), but are gradually finding satisfactory supply sources in the
United States. We make patent information about cyclodextrins available to our customers. We also offer our customers our knowledge
of the properties and potential new uses of cyclodextrins and complexes.  

As
most of our customers use our cyclodextrin products in their research and development activities, the timing, product mix, and
volume of their orders from us are unpredictable. We also have four large customers (each of whom has historically purchased from
us annually and, depending upon the year, may account for greater than 10% of our annual revenues) who have a significant effect
on our revenues when they increase or decrease their research and development activities that use cyclodextrins. We keep in constant
contact with these customers as to their cyclodextrin needs so we can maintain the proper inventory composition and quantity in
anticipation of their needs. The sales to large customers and the product mix and volume of products sold has a significant effect
on our revenues and product margins. These factors contribute to our revenue volatility from quarter to quarter and year to year.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our cash decreased to $1,270,000 as of September 30,
2016, compared to $1,842,000 as of December 31, 2015. Our current assets and current liabilities were $2,018,552 and $875,948,
respectively, as of September 30, 2016, compared to current assets of $2,522,886 and current liabilities of $945,146 at December
31, 2015. All of our term debt is classified as current at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 due to our non-compliance
with a loan covenant as described below. We owed $500,667 at September 30, 2016 on a secured mortgage note and $172,366 under an
equipment loan, with a bank that has a debt service covenant. We are not in compliance with this debt service coverage covenant.
If we are unable to have the debt covenant modified, or we are unable to refinance the indebtedness, we may be required to use
our cash on hand to repay the indebtedness, which will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by diverting cash
intended for use in our development of a clinical trial program or for other business development efforts. 

On
August 5, 2016, the Company listed for sale its real property located in Alachua, Florida. In the event we are able to complete
the sale of this property on terms acceptable to us, we expect to repay our secured loans in full.  

The
Company presently believes that it will require additional cash to meet its anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure
requirements for the next twelve months, including, without limitation, to commence and continue its approved U.S. and U.K. clinical
trials. To date, the Company has been able to generate sufficient cash to fund its drug development activities from private offerings
of its equity securities, together with cash generated from operations and asset sales. While we expect to continue to be successful
in obtaining additional funds to meet our cash requirements, no assurance can be given that adequate additional funding will be
available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Additional capital will also be required in the future to develop our drug product
candidates through clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our ability to obtain such additional capital will
likely be subject to various factors, including the results of our clinical trials, our progress in obtaining regulatory approval
for our drug candidates and market conditions.  

On
January 21, 2016, we closed on the sale of our real property located in High Springs, Florida, which had been previously classified
on our balance sheet as property held for sale, with a carrying value of $275,000. Pursuant to the terms of the sale, at the closing,
the buyer paid us $10,000 in cash, less selling costs and settlement charges, and we received a promissory note in the principal
amount of $265,000, and a mortgage in our favor securing the buyer s obligations under the promissory note. The promissory
note provides for monthly payments of $3,653, including principal and interest at 4.25%, over a seven-year period commencing March
1, 2016.  

We
plan to use our available cash primarily for the development of our Trappsol  Cyclo  orphan drug product, including
implementation of our U.S. and international clinical trials and designs, and other general corporate purposes.  

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2016.  

Results
of Operations - Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

We
reported a net loss of $(1,615,000) and $(3,392,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to a net loss of $(748,000) and $(1,496,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.    

Total
revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased 18% to $278,000 compared to $235,000 for the same period
in 2015. Total revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased 24% to $975,000 compared to $788,000 for
the same period in 2015.  

Our
change in the mix of our product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

Trappsol 
Cyclo   

  Our
sales of Trappsol  Cyclo  increased 11% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, to $21,000, from $19,000
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015.  Our sales of Trappsol  Cyclo  increased by 22% for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, to $401,000 from $329,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Our
sales to a particular customer who exports Trappsol  Cyclo  to South America were $21,000 (100% of total sales of Trappsol 
Cyclo ) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to no sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015;
and our sales to that same customer who exports Trappsol  Cyclo  to South America were $386,000 (96% of total sales
of Trappsol  Cyclo ) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $270,000 (82% of total sales of
Trappsol  Cyclo ) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Our 2015 sales to this customer were $296,000
(84% of total 2015 sales of Trappsol  Cyclo ).  This product is designated as an orphan drug; the population
of patients is small and while we expect our future sales to increase, the timing of sales will be unpredictable and our ability
to market the drug for use other than research is severely constrained by regulatory restrictions in the applicable jurisdictions.    

Trappsol 
HPB   

  Our
sales of Trappsol  HPB increased by 31% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, to $163,000 from $124,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our sales of Trappsol  HPB increased by 43% for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, to $397,000 from $278,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Trappsol 
other products   

  Our
sales of other Trappsol  products decreased by 36% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, to $35,000 from $55,000
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Our sales of other Trappsol  products decreased by 32% for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, to $74,000 from $109,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Aquaplex    

  Our
sales of Aquaplex  were $57,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $32,000 for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2015. Our sales of Aquaplex  were $78,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $63,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Our
largest customers continue to follow historical product ordering trends by placing periodic large orders that represent a significant
share of our annual sales volume. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our two largest customers accounted for 52%
of our sales; the largest accounted for 41% of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our three largest customers
accounted for 50% of our sales; the largest accounted for 34% of sales. Historically, our usual smaller sales of HPB occur more
frequently throughout the year compared to our large sales that we receive periodically. The timing of when we receive and are
able to complete these two kinds of sales has a significant effect on our quarterly revenues and operating results and makes period
to period comparisons difficult.  

Our
cost of products sold (excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 was 13% ($124,000) compared to 13% ($105,000) for the same period in 2015. Our cost of products sold
(excluding any allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) as a percentage of sales was 11% ($31,000) for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 11% ($25,000) for the same period in 2015.  Historically, the timing
and product mix of sales to our large customers has had a significant effect on our sales, cost of products sold (excluding any
allocation of direct and indirect overhead and handling costs) and the related margin. We did not experience any significant increases
in material costs during 2015 or 2014, or the first nine months of 2016.  

Our
gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities include all the costs related to their distribution
network in cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold includes only the cost of products sold and does not include any allocation
of inbound or outbound freight charges, indirect overhead expenses, warehouse and distribution expenses, or depreciation and amortization
expense. We have six employees who provide receiving, inspection, warehousing and shipping operations for us. The cost of these
employees, and our other employees, are included in personnel expense. Our other costs of warehousing and shipping functions are
included in office and other expense. As we buy most of our   inventory from foreign suppliers, the change in the value of
the U.S. dollar in relation to the Euro, Yen and Yuan has had and will continue to have an effect on our cost of inventory. Our
main supplier of specialty cyclodextrins and complexes, Cyclodextrin Research   Development Laboratory, is located in Hungary
and its prices are set in Euros.  

Personnel
expenses increased to $328,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $223,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Personnel expenses increased to $1,010,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $551,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in personnel expense is due to an increase in the number of employees and employee benefits.
We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in 2016 as the result of additional employees and our International Clinical
Program product development activities.  

Research
and development expenses increased to $311,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $221,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses increased to $1,255,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
from $399,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in research and development expense is due to the International
Clinical Program. We expect research and development costs to increase in 2016 as we continue to seek regulatory approval for
the use of Trappsol  Cyclo  in the treatment of NPC.  

Repairs
and maintenance expenses decreased to $3,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $7,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Repairs and maintenance expenses decreased to $19,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $24,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Professional
fees increased to $176,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $101,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Professional fees increased to $455,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $324,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Professional fees may further increase due to new initiatives in raising capital or compliance
for developing new products.  

Office
and other expenses increased to $171,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $85,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Office and other expenses increased to $479,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $213,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Board
of Directors fees and costs decreased to $53,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $140,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Board of Directors fee and costs decreased to $100,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $392,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Amortization
and depreciation was $4,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Amortization and depreciation was $92,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $125,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Freight
and shipping was $1,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Freight and shipping was $5,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Interest
expense was $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. Interest expense was $22,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $24,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  

We
recorded a $810,000 impairment loss on our office and pulse dryer for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded
a $125,000 impairment loss on our High Springs property (which was subsequently sold) for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015.  

We
increased our valuation allowance to offset the increase in our deferred tax asset from our net operating loss and did not recognize
an income benefit or provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's

5.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
    financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
    performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.
