NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of presentation  

The interim financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and notes thereto included in the Company s 10-K annual report. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports. 

Principles of consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bollente Companies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. On May 16, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Bollente, Inc.  On the date of acquisition, Bollente, Inc. was 2.78% owned and controlled 100% by Robertson J. Orr, a majority shareholder and officer and director of Bollente Companies, Inc. and the acquisition was accounted for by means of a pooling of the entities from the date of inception of Bollente Companies, Inc. on March 7, 2008 because the entities were under common control. On August 13, 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Bollente International, Inc.  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Use of estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value. 

Website  

The Company capitalizes the costs associated with the development of the Company s website pursuant to ASC Topic 350.  Other costs related to the maintenance of the website are expensed as incurred.  Amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of 3 years using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes.   The Company plans to commence amortization upon completion and release of the Company s fully operational website.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards.  This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.  

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50. 

Earnings per share  

The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earning per common share ( EPS ) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earning per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation. 

Inventory  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average cost) or market (net realizable value). 

Revenue recognition  

The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable.  The Company records revenue from the sale of product upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer.  The Company also records the shipping income when the products are sent to the customer. 

Fair value of financial instruments  

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2014. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand. 

Level 1:  The preferred inputs to valuation efforts are  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,  with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market.  Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Level 2 : FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist, they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations. 

Level 3:  If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as  unobservable,  and limits their use by saying they  shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.  This category allows  for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date . Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that  observable inputs  are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As a result, the Company incurred accumulated net losses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of ($19,649,101). In addition, the Company s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through debt and equity financing. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

General 

Bollente Companies Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and currently operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on December 3, 2009. 

Bollente manufactures and sells a high quality, whole-house, electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. 

On August 13, 2015, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente International, Inc. ( Bollente International ), to begin international manufacturing and sales expansion for our trutankless  line of water hearters. 

Bollente International has partnered with international manufacturing firm to increase production and efficiently handle distribution to customers in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, Asia, Dubai, Australia and New Zealand.  We have begun the testing and certification process for several international standards, demonstrating that the product complies with the essential requirements of European health, safety and environmental protection legislation and opening the gate for future sales to more than 30 European countries. 

Products 

Trutankless  

We manufacture and distribute trutankless  water heaters, a line of new, high-quality, highly efficient electric tankless water heaters. Our trutankless  water heaters are engineered to outperform and outlast both its tank and tankless predecessors in energy efficiency, output, and durability. It provides endless hot water on demand for a whole household and it also integrates with home automation systems. We have several features and design innovations which are new to the electric tankless water heater market that we believe will give our products a sustainable competitive advantage over our rivals in the market. 

15 

Our trutankless  water heaters are designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products are capable of higher temperature rise than competitive units at given flow rates because of its improved design and greater efficiency. Our trutankless  water heaters can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. Generally, a typical tank water heater lasts about 11 years, whereas gas tankless systems may last longer, but requires more routine maintenance. Our product line is designed to last longer than tank water heaters without any routine maintenance required under most conditions. 

We created a custom heat exchanger for our trutankless  product line that utilizes our patent pending Velix technology to heat water as it flows through the system, which means customers need not worry about running out of hot water. We believe we ve selected the best materials available and a collection of exclusive design elements and features to maximize capacity, minimize energy use, and provide a truly maintenance free experience. 

Our trutankless  water heaters were officially launched in the first quarter of 2014 and is sold throughout the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. We began generating revenue in the first quarter of 2014. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we generated $238,912   in revenue. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $265,504   in revenue. As of the three months ended June 30, 2016, we generated $66,278 in revenue. 

In July of 2014, we launched MYtankless, a customizable online control panel for our trutankless  line of smart electric water heaters. From the dashboard, residential and commercial users can obtain real-time status reports, adjust unit temperature settings, view up to three years of water usage data, and change notification settings from anywhere in the world, using a computer or web-enabled smart device at www.mytankless.com.

Going Concern

Management intends to use borrowings and security sales to mitigate the effects of cash flow deficits; however, no assurance can be given that debt or equity financing, if and when required, will be available. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue existence. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $19,649,101. Primarily because of our history of operating losses and our recording of note payables, we have a working capital deficiency of $658,343 at June 30, 2016. Losses have been funded primarily through issuance of common stock and borrowings from our stockholders and third-party debt.

Secured Loan Agreement and Warrant Agreement 

On August 2, 2016, we entered into a Loan Agreement and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Built-Right Holdings, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company ( Lender ).  The Manager of Built-Right Holdings, LLC is 4C Management, Inc., whose Vice President is Rod Cullum, a consultant and shareholder of the Company.

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activites 

The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this Quarterly Report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and borrowings. 

22 

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Operating activities -  Net cash used in operating activities was $457,447 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $1,431,402 used in operating activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a higher volume of units sold and decrease in research and development and consulting contract cost. 

Investing activities -  Net cash used in investing activities was $2,381 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $3,250 used in investing activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a reduction in the purchase of trademarks. 

Financing activities -  Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $458,000, as compared to $1,631,050 for the same period of 2015. The decrease of net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to less equity financing. 

Ongoing Funding Requirements 

As of June 30, 2016, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing to provide the capital we need to run the business. It is possible that we may need additional funding to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements. 

23 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we intend to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of those sources of funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or relationships with third parties when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts; abandon our business strategy of growth through acquisitions; or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. See Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

24 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the Company s last fiscal quarter, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s current management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), who concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

Management reviews the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to the Company s processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities and migrating processes. 

During the Company s last fiscal quarter, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

25 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Bollente Companies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Company ), hereby promises to pay to the order of Russell J. Hooker and Sadie A. Hooker, or their assigns (the  Noteholder ), in lawful money of the United States of America, and in immediately payable funds, the principal sum of $50,000.  The principal hereof and any unpaid accrued interest thereon shall be due and payable on June 2, 2018 (the  Maturity Date ). 

This Note (the  Note ) is one of a series of identical twelve percent (12%) senior secured convertible promissory note and security agreements (the  Promissory Notes ) issued or to be issued as part of an Offering being conducted by the Company in an aggregate principal amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000). The Promissory Notes rank equally and ratably without priority over one another. 

This Note has been issued pursuant to a Subscription Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and the Noteholder (the  Subscription Agreement ), which contains representations and warranties and additional covenants of the Company with respect to the Note.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Subscription Agreement.  THE PROVISIONS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 

1.            PAYMENTS .  The Company hereby promises to pay to the Noteholder, in lawful money of the United States of America, and in immediately payable funds, the principal sum of $50,000.  The principal hereof and any unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date (unless such payment date is accelerated as provided in Section 4 hereof).  Payment of all amounts due hereunder shall be made at the address of the Noteholder provided for in the Subscription Agreement.  The Company further promises to pay simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum ( Interest ) on the outstanding principal balance hereof, such interest to be payable semi-annually and at the Maturity Date (prorated for any partial month). 

2.            CONVERSION .  At any time prior to the payment in full of this Note, the outstanding principal amount of this Note, along with all accrued but unpaid Interest hereunder (the  Outstanding Balance ) may be converted by one of the following events: 

(a)           The Outstanding Balance is convertible at the option of the holder into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share.  In order to convert the Outstanding Balance, Noteholder shall deliver to the Company a written Election to Convert, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  As soon as reasonably practicable upon receipt of the written Election to Convert, the Company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written order of the Noteholder, and in such name or names as the Noteholder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the full number of Note Shares so purchased upon conversion of the Note.  Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such securities as of the date of delivery of the Election to Convert, notwithstanding that the certificate or certificates representing such securities shall not actually have been delivered or that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed. 

3.            SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS .  This Note is senior in the right of payment to all other indebtedness of the Company. For purposes of this Note, indebtedness shall mean and include the aggregate amount of, without duplication, (i) all obligations for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (iii) all obligations to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services (other than accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals), (iv) all obligations with respect to capital leases, (v) all guaranty obligations, and (vi) all reimbursement and any other payment obligations, contingent or otherwise, in respect of letters of credit. 

Additionally, for the term of this Note the Company shall not issue any additional senior or parity debt or pay any shareholder cash dividends unless otherwise agreed to by the Noteholder. 

4.            SECURITY INTEREST .  The Company hereby grants the Noteholder a security interest in all of the Company s assets and property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, wherever located, and whether now or hereafter existing or arising (collectively, the  Collateral ), including, without limitation, all cash, equipment, inventory, accounts, notes, contracts, general intangibles and proceeds of any and all of the Collateral. The security interest created hereunder is pari passu with any other holder(s) of Notes.  This security interest is granted to secure the debt evidenced by this note and agreement. The Company will prepare and file a UCC financing statement in the state of Nevada, or whatever documents are necessary to perfect Noteholder s security interest. 

5.            DEFAULT .  The occurrence of any one of the following events shall constitute an Event of Default: 

(a)           The non-payment, when due, of any principal or interest pursuant to this Note; 

(b)           The material breach of any representation or warranty in this Note or in the Subscription Agreement.  In the event the Noteholder becomes aware of a breach of this Section 5(b), the Noteholder shall notify the Company in writing of such breach and the Company shall have ten days notice to effect a cure of such breach;

In the event the Noteholder becomes aware of a breach of this Section 5(c), the Noteholder shall notify the Company in writing of such breach and the Company shall have ten days notice to effect a cure of such breach; 

(d)           A default shall occur in the payment when due (subject to any applicable grace period), whether by acceleration or otherwise, of any indebtedness of the Company or an event of default or similar event shall occur with respect to such indebtedness, if the effect of such default or event (subject to any required notice and any applicable grace period) would be to accelerate the maturity of any such indebtedness or to permit the holder or holders of such indebtedness to cause such indebtedness to become due and payable prior to its express maturity; 

(e)           The commencement by the Company of any voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment or debt, receivership, dissolution, or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect; or the adjudication of the Company as insolvent or bankrupt by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; or the petition or application by the Company for, acquiescence in, or consent by the Company to, the appointment of any receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company; or the assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors; or the written admission of the Company of its inability to pay its debts as they mature; or 

(f)           The commencement against the Company of any proceeding relating to the Company under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, adjustment of debt, receivership, dissolution or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect, provided, however, that the commencement of such a proceeding shall not constitute an Event of Default unless the Company consents to the same or admits in writing the material allegations of same, or said proceeding shall remain undismissed for 30 days; or the issuance of any order, judgment or decree for the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company, which order, judgment or decree remains undismissed for 30 days; or a warrant of attachment, execution, or similar process shall be issued against any substantial part of the property of the Company.

Investor has reviewed the Subscription Agreement, the Note, and the Disclosure Documents with care.  Additionally, Investor has had a full opportunity to inspect the books and records of the Company and to make any and all inquiries of Company officers and directors regarding the Company and its business as Investor has deemed appropriate. 

(c)      Investor is an  Accredited Investor  as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Act ) or Investor, either alone or with Investor s professional advisers who are unaffiliated with, have no equity interest in and are not compensated by the Company or any affiliate or selling agent of the Company, directly or indirectly, has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities offered by the Company and of making an informed investment decision with respect thereto and has the capacity to protect Investor s own interests in connection with Investor s proposed investment in the Securities.

BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC. 

WARRANT AGREEMENT 

To Purchase Shares of Common Stock 

THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, Russell J. Hooker and Sadie A. Hooker (the  Holder ), is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on or after the date hereof, to subscribe for and purchase from, BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC., a California corporation (the  Company ), 50,000 of the fully paid non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock ( Common Stock ) at a purchase price of $1.50 per share, provided that such right will terminate, if not terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions hereof, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the fifth year anniversary of the issuance of this Warrant (the  Expiration Date ).  The purchase price and the number of shares for which this warrant (the  Warrant ) is exercisable are subject to adjustment, as provided herein.  The Warrants being sold and issued pursuant to this agreement shall be evidenced by the warrant certificate attached as  Annex A  hereto (the  Warrant Certificate ).  This Warrant was issued in connection with a Subscription Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and Holder (the  Subscription Agreement ) for the sale of (i) a note bearing interest at the rate of 12% per annum, on the principal amount of $50,000 (the  Note ), and (ii) this Warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, and is subject to the terms of the Subscription Agreement; provided, however, that any that any conflict between the provisions of this Warrant and the Subscription Agreement, the provisions of this Warrant shall control.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein will have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Subscription Agreement. 

As used herein the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following respective meanings: 

(a)           The term  Company  shall include Bollente Companies, Inc., and any entity which shall succeed or assume the obligations of Bollente Companies, Inc., hereunder. 

(b)           The term  Warrant Shares  includes (i) the Company s common stock and (ii) any other securities into which or for which any of the Common Stock may be converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of recapitalization, reorganization, merger, sale of assets or otherwise. 

(c)           The term  Other Securities  refers to any stock (other than Common Stock) and other securities of the Company or any other person (corporate or otherwise) which the holder of the Warrant at any time shall be entitled to receive, or shall have received, on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or in addition to Common Stock, or which at any time shall be issuable or shall have been issued in exchange for or in replacement of Common Stock or Other Securities. 

(d)           The term  Exercise Price  shall be $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms hereof. 

(e)           The   Fair Market Value  of one share shall be defined as the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of this Warrant (the  Average Closing Price ), as reported by any over-the-counter electronic quotation system; provided, however, that if the common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the Average Closing Price on such exchange for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of the Warrant.  If the shares of common stock are/were not traded during the ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, then the closing price for the last publicly traded day shall be deemed to be the closing price for any and all (if applicable) days during such ten trading day period. If the shares of Common Stock are/were not traded for longer than ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, of if the shares were never publicly traded prior to the date of the exercise, the Fair Market Value of a Warrant Share shall be determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors. 

1.   

Number of Shares Issuable upon Exercise . 

Unless sooner terminated in accordance herewith, from and after the date hereof through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant in whole or in part, the number of Warrant Shares set forth on the first page of this Warrant, subject to adjustment pursuant hereto, by delivery of an original or fax copy of the exercise notice on the reverse side of the warrant certificate attached hereto as  Annex A   (the  Notice of Exercise ) along with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price.  The company is obligated to provide ten business days written notice to the Holder of the expiration of the warrant by US mail at the Holder s address of record and by email. 

2.       Exercise of Warrant . 

(a)           The purchase rights represented by this Warrant are exercisable by the registered Holder hereof, in whole at any time or in part from time to time by delivery of the Notice of Exercise duly completed and executed at the office of the Company in Arizona (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder hereof at the address of such Holder appearing on the books of the Company), and upon payment of the Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased (in the manner provided in Section 2(d) hereof); whereupon the Holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares so purchased; provided that the Company will place on each certificate a legend substantially the same as that appearing on this Warrant, 

in addition to any legend required by any applicable state or federal law. If this Warrant is exercised in part, the Company will issue to the Holder hereof a new Warrant upon the same terms as this Warrant but for the balance of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant remains exercisable.  The Company agrees that upon exercise of this Warrant the Holder shall be deemed to be the record owner of the Warrant Shares issued upon exercise as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid.  This Warrant will be surrendered at the time of exercise or if lost, stolen, misplaced, or destroyed, the Holder will comply with Section 7 below. 

(b)           Certificates for Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be delivered to the Holder hereof within a reasonable time after the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid. 

(c)           The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue which shall be paid by the Company in accordance with Section 4 below). 

(d)           In order to exercise this Warrant with respect to all or any part of the Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is at the time exercisable, Holder (or any other person or persons exercising the Warrant) must take the following actions: 

(i)           Execute and deliver to the Company a written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares being purchased (in whole shares only) and such other information set forth on the form of Notice of Exercise attached hereto as Annex A; and 

(ii)           Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares in one or more of the following forms: 

(A)           Cash, check, or wire transfer; or 

(B)           A promissory note payable to the Company, but only to the extent authorized by the Company. 

3.               No Fractional Shares . 

The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant or to deliver Warrant Certificates which evidence fractional Warrant Shares.  In the event that a fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 3, be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall pay to the Holder exercising the Warrant an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Warrant Share. 

4.            Charges, Taxes, and Expenses . 

Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Warrant, or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder of this Warrant; provided, however, that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder of this Warrant, the Company may require, as a condition thereto, that the transferee execute an appropriate investment representation as may be reasonably required by the Company. 

5.            No Rights as Shareholders . 

This Warrant does not entitle the Holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a Shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof.    

6.            Exchange and Registry of Warrant . 

This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the registered Holder at the above-mentioned office or agency of the Company, for a new Warrant or Warrants aggregating the total Warrant Shares of the surrendered Warrant of like tenor and dated as of such exchange.  The Company shall maintain at the above-mentioned office or agency a registry showing the name and address of the registered Holder of this Warrant.  This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange, transfer, or exercise, in accordance with its terms, at such office or agency of the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry. 

7.            Loss, Theft, Destruction, or Mutilation of Warrant . 

Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor (but with no additional rights or obligations) and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of this Warrant. 

8.            Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc.  

If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall be a Saturday or a Sunday or shall be a legal holiday, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. 

9.            Cash Distributions . 

No adjustment on account of cash dividends or interest on the Company s Common Stock or Other Securities that may become purchasable hereunder will be made to the Exercise Price under this Warrant. 

10.            Consolidation, Merger, or Sale of the Company . 

If the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock, the successor corporation (or corporation controlling the successor corporation or the Company, as the case may be) shall by operation of law assume the Company s obligations under this Warrant.  Upon consummation of such transaction, the Warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other assets which the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, or transfer if the holder had exercised the Warrant immediately before the effective date of such transaction.  As a condition to the consummation of such transaction, the Company shall arrange for the person or entity obligated to issue securities or deliver cash or other assets upon exercise of the Warrant to, concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, assume the Company s obligations hereunder by executing an instrument so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section 10. 

11.            Adjustments for Stock Splits, Combinations, etc.  

The number of shares and class of capital stock purchasable under this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 11. 

(a)           Adjustment for change in capital stock.  If the Company: 

(i)           pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock, in each case, in shares of its Common Stock; 

(ii)           subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; 

(iii)           combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; 

(iv)           makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or 

(v)           issues by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any shares of its capital stock; 

then the number and classes of shares purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised may receive the number and classes of shares of capital stock of the Company which such holder would have owned immediately following such action if such holder had exercised the Warrant immediately prior to such action. 

For a dividend or distribution the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the dividend or distribution.  For a subdivision, combination, or reclassification, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of the subdivision, combination, or reclassification. 

If after an adjustment the Holder, upon exercise of a Warrant, may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company shall in good faith determine the allocation of the adjusted Exercise Price between or among the classes of capital stock.  After such allocation, that portion of the Exercise Price applicable to each share of each such class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the allocation of the Exercise Price between or among shares of capital stock as provided by this Section 11(a), a Warrant may only be exercised in full by payment of the entire Exercise Price currently in effect. 

(b)           The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 11 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the exercise rights of the Holders of this Warrant against impairment. 

12.            Certificate as to Adjustments . 

In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the exercise of the Warrant, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the Holder of the Warrant and any Warrant agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 16 hereof). 

13.            Reservation of Stock Issuable on Exercise of Warrant . 

The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery on the exercise of the Warrant, shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant. 

14.            Assignment; Exchange of Warrant . 

Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant, and the rights evidenced hereby, may be transferred by any registered Holder hereof (a  Transferor ) with respect to any or all of the shares underlying this Warrant.  On the surrender for exchange of this Warrant, together with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company demonstrating compliance with applicable securities laws, which shall include, without limitation, a legal opinion from the Transferor s counsel that such transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of applicable securities laws, the Company at its expense (but with payment by the Transferor of any applicable transfer taxes) will issue and deliver to or on the order of the Transferor thereof a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of the Transferor and/or the transferee(s) specified (each a  Transferee ), calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of Warrant Shares called for on the face or faces of the Warrant so surrendered by the Transferor; and provided further, that upon any such transfer, the Company may require, as a condition thereto, that the Transferee execute an appropriate investment representation as may be reasonably required by the Company. 

15.            Rule 144 Rights . 

The Company will provide any and all legal opinions required for the removal of the restrictive legend from any stock certificate(s) issued upon exercise of this Warrant under Rule 144, at the Company s expense.  The Company shall process any request for removal of the restrictive legend within ten business days.  If the Company fails to process any legal request for removal of restrictive legends for more than ten business days after receipt of a written request to do so, the Company shall pay the Holder or stockholder, as applicable, a cash penalty of 1% per day of the Fair Market Value of the securities whose legends were requested to be removed. 

16.            Warrant Agent . 

The Company may, by written notice to each Holder of a Warrant, appoint an agent for the purpose of issuing Warrant Shares (or Other Securities) on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 2, exchanging this Warrant pursuant to Section 14, and replacing this Warrant pursuant to Section 7, or any of the foregoing, and thereafter any such issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such agent. 

17.            Notices, etc . 

Any notice pursuant to this Warrant by the Company or by a Holder or a holder of Warrant Shares shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally, or if mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, or transmitted by facsimile, to the parties at the addresses or facsimile numbers set forth below.

Any party from time to time may change its address, facsimile number or other information for the purpose of notices to that party by giving notice specifying such change to the other party hereto. 

18.            Notices of Record Date . 

In case, 

(a)           The Company takes a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or to receive a dividend, distribution or any other rights; 

(b)           There is any capital reorganization of the Company, reclassification of the capital stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding shares of Common Stock), or consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation which does not constitute a sale of the Company; or 

(c)           There is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company;

The Promissory Notes rank equally and ratably without priority over one another. 

This Note has been issued pursuant to a Subscription Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and the Noteholder (the  Subscription Agreement ), which contains representations and warranties and additional covenants of the Company with respect to the Note.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Subscription Agreement.  THE PROVISIONS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

(d)           A default shall occur in the payment when due (subject to any applicable grace period), whether by acceleration or otherwise, of any indebtedness of the Company or an event of default or similar event shall occur with respect to such indebtedness, if the effect of such default or event (subject to any required notice and any applicable grace period) would be to accelerate the maturity of any such indebtedness or to permit the holder or holders of such indebtedness to cause such indebtedness to become due and payable prior to its express maturity; 

(e)           The commencement by the Company of any voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment or debt, receivership, dissolution, or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect; or the adjudication of the Company as insolvent or bankrupt by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; or the petition or application by the Company for, acquiescence in, or consent by the Company to, the appointment of any receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company; or the assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors; or the written admission of the Company of its inability to pay its debts as they mature; or 

(f)           The commencement against the Company of any proceeding relating to the Company under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, adjustment of debt, receivership, dissolution or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect, provided, however, that the commencement of such a proceeding shall not constitute an Event of Default unless the Company consents to the same or admits in writing the material allegations of same, or said proceeding shall remain undismissed for 30 days; or the issuance of any order, judgment or decree for the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company, which order, judgment or decree remains undismissed for 30 days; or a warrant of attachment, execution, or similar process shall be issued against any substantial part of the property of the Company.

BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC. 

WARRANT AGREEMENT 

To Purchase Shares of Common Stock 

THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, Russell J. Hooker and Sadie A. Hooker (the  Holder ), is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on or after the date hereof, to subscribe for and purchase from, BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC., a California corporation (the  Company ), 10,000 of the fully paid non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock ( Common Stock ) at a purchase price of $1.50 per share, provided that such right will terminate, if not terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions hereof, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the fifth year anniversary of the issuance of this Warrant (the  Expiration Date ).  The purchase price and the number of shares for which this warrant (the  Warrant ) is exercisable are subject to adjustment, as provided herein.  The Warrants being sold and issued pursuant to this agreement shall be evidenced by the warrant certificate attached as  Annex A  hereto (the  Warrant Certificate ).  This Warrant was issued in connection with a Subscription Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and Holder (the  Subscription Agreement ) for the sale of (i) a note bearing interest at the rate of 12% per annum, on the principal amount of $10,000 (the  Note ), and (ii) this Warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, and is subject to the terms of the Subscription Agreement; provided, however, that any that any conflict between the provisions of this Warrant and the Subscription Agreement, the provisions of this Warrant shall control.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein will have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Subscription Agreement. 

As used herein the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following respective meanings: 

(a)           The term  Company  shall include Bollente Companies, Inc., and any entity which shall succeed or assume the obligations of Bollente Companies, Inc., hereunder. 

(b)           The term  Warrant Shares  includes (i) the Company s common stock and (ii) any other securities into which or for which any of the Common Stock may be converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of recapitalization, reorganization, merger, sale of assets or otherwise. 

(c)           The term  Other Securities  refers to any stock (other than Common Stock) and other securities of the Company or any other person (corporate or otherwise) which the holder of the Warrant at any time shall be entitled to receive, or shall have received, on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or in addition to Common Stock, or which at any time shall be issuable or shall have been issued in exchange for or in replacement of Common Stock or Other Securities. 

(d)           The term  Exercise Price  shall be $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms hereof. 

(e)           The   Fair Market Value  of one share shall be defined as the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of this Warrant (the  Average Closing Price ), as reported by any over-the-counter electronic quotation system; provided, however, that if the common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the Average Closing Price on such exchange for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of the Warrant.  If the shares of common stock are/were not traded during the ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, then the closing price for the last publicly traded day shall be deemed to be the closing price for any and all (if applicable) days during such ten trading day period. If the shares of Common Stock are/were not traded for longer than ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, of if the shares were never publicly traded prior to the date of the exercise, the Fair Market Value of a Warrant Share shall be determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors. 

1.   

Number of Shares Issuable upon Exercise . 

Unless sooner terminated in accordance herewith, from and after the date hereof through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant in whole or in part, the number of Warrant Shares set forth on the first page of this Warrant, subject to adjustment pursuant hereto, by delivery of an original or fax copy of the exercise notice on the reverse side of the warrant certificate attached hereto as  Annex A   (the  Notice of Exercise ) along with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price.  The company is obligated to provide ten business days written notice to the Holder of the expiration of the warrant by US mail at the Holder s address of record and by email. 

2.       Exercise of Warrant . 

(a)           The purchase rights represented by this Warrant are exercisable by the registered Holder hereof, in whole at any time or in part from time to time by delivery of the Notice of Exercise duly completed and executed at the office of the Company in Arizona (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder hereof at the address of such Holder appearing on the books of the Company), and upon payment of the Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased (in the manner provided in Section 2(d) hereof); whereupon the Holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares so purchased; provided that the Company will place on each certificate a legend substantially the same as that appearing on this Warrant, 

in addition to any legend required by any applicable state or federal law. If this Warrant is exercised in part, the Company will issue to the Holder hereof a new Warrant upon the same terms as this Warrant but for the balance of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant remains exercisable.  The Company agrees that upon exercise of this Warrant the Holder shall be deemed to be the record owner of the Warrant Shares issued upon exercise as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid.  This Warrant will be surrendered at the time of exercise or if lost, stolen, misplaced, or destroyed, the Holder will comply with Section 7 below. 

(b)           Certificates for Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be delivered to the Holder hereof within a reasonable time after the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid. 

(c)           The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue which shall be paid by the Company in accordance with Section 4 below). 

(d)           In order to exercise this Warrant with respect to all or any part of the Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is at the time exercisable, Holder (or any other person or persons exercising the Warrant) must take the following actions: 

(i)           Execute and deliver to the Company a written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares being purchased (in whole shares only) and such other information set forth on the form of Notice of Exercise attached hereto as Annex A; and 

(ii)           Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares in one or more of the following forms: 

(A)           Cash, check, or wire transfer; or 

(B)           A promissory note payable to the Company, but only to the extent authorized by the Company. 

3.               No Fractional Shares . 

The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant or to deliver Warrant Certificates which evidence fractional Warrant Shares.  In the event that a fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 3, be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall pay to the Holder exercising the Warrant an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Warrant Share. 

4.            Charges, Taxes, and Expenses . 

Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Warrant, or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder of this Warrant; provided, however, that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder of this Warrant, the Company may require, as a condition thereto, that the transferee execute an appropriate investment representation as may be reasonably required by the Company. 

5.            No Rights as Shareholders . 

This Warrant does not entitle the Holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a Shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof.    

6.            Exchange and Registry of Warrant . 

This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the registered Holder at the above-mentioned office or agency of the Company, for a new Warrant or Warrants aggregating the total Warrant Shares of the surrendered Warrant of like tenor and dated as of such exchange.  The Company shall maintain at the above-mentioned office or agency a registry showing the name and address of the registered Holder of this Warrant.  This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange, transfer, or exercise, in accordance with its terms, at such office or agency of the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry. 

7.            Loss, Theft, Destruction, or Mutilation of Warrant . 

Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor (but with no additional rights or obligations) and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of this Warrant. 

8.            Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc.  

If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall be a Saturday or a Sunday or shall be a legal holiday, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. 

9.            Cash Distributions . 

No adjustment on account of cash dividends or interest on the Company s Common Stock or Other Securities that may become purchasable hereunder will be made to the Exercise Price under this Warrant. 

10.            Consolidation, Merger, or Sale of the Company . 

If the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock, the successor corporation (or corporation controlling the successor corporation or the Company, as the case may be) shall by operation of law assume the Company s obligations under this Warrant.  Upon consummation of such transaction, the Warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other assets which the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, or transfer if the holder had exercised the Warrant immediately before the effective date of such transaction.  As a condition to the consummation of such transaction, the Company shall arrange for the person or entity obligated to issue securities or deliver cash or other assets upon exercise of the Warrant to, concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, assume the Company s obligations hereunder by executing an instrument so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section 10. 

11.            Adjustments for Stock Splits, Combinations, etc.  

The number of shares and class of capital stock purchasable under this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 11. 

(a)           Adjustment for change in capital stock.  If the Company: 

(i)           pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock, in each case, in shares of its Common Stock; 

(ii)           subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; 

(iii)           combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; 

(iv)           makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or 

(v)           issues by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any shares of its capital stock; 

then the number and classes of shares purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised may receive the number and classes of shares of capital stock of the Company which such holder would have owned immediately following such action if such holder had exercised the Warrant immediately prior to such action. 

For a dividend or distribution the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the dividend or distribution.  For a subdivision, combination, or reclassification, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of the subdivision, combination, or reclassification. 

If after an adjustment the Holder, upon exercise of a Warrant, may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company shall in good faith determine the allocation of the adjusted Exercise Price between or among the classes of capital stock.  After such allocation, that portion of the Exercise Price applicable to each share of each such class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the allocation of the Exercise Price between or among shares of capital stock as provided by this Section 11(a), a Warrant may only be exercised in full by payment of the entire Exercise Price currently in effect.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Subscription Agreement.  THE PROVISIONS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. 

1.            PAYMENTS .  The Company hereby promises to pay to the Noteholder, in lawful money of the United States of America, and in immediately payable funds, the principal sum of $50,000.  The principal hereof and any unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date (unless such payment date is accelerated as provided in Section 4 hereof).  Payment of all amounts due hereunder shall be made at the address of the Noteholder provided for in the Subscription Agreement.  The Company further promises to pay simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum ( Interest ) on the outstanding principal balance hereof, such interest to be payable semi-annually and at the Maturity Date (prorated for any partial month). 

2.            CONVERSION .  At any time prior to the payment in full of this Note, the outstanding principal amount of this Note, along with all accrued but unpaid Interest hereunder (the  Outstanding Balance ) may be converted by one of the following events: 

(a)           The Outstanding Balance is convertible at the option of the holder into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share.  In order to convert the Outstanding Balance, Noteholder shall deliver to the Company a written Election to Convert, a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  As soon as reasonably practicable upon receipt of the written Election to Convert, the Company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written order of the Noteholder, and in such name or names as the Noteholder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the full number of Note Shares so purchased upon conversion of the Note.  Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such securities as of the date of delivery of the Election to Convert, notwithstanding that the certificate or certificates representing such securities shall not actually have been delivered or that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed. 

3.            SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS .  This Note is senior in the right of payment to all other indebtedness of the Company. For purposes of this Note, indebtedness shall mean and include the aggregate amount of, without duplication, (i) all obligations for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (iii) all obligations to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services (other than accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals), (iv) all obligations with respect to capital leases, (v) all guaranty obligations, and (vi) all reimbursement and any other payment obligations, contingent or otherwise, in respect of letters of credit. 

Additionally, for the term of this Note the Company shall not issue any additional senior or parity debt or pay any shareholder cash dividends unless otherwise agreed to by the Noteholder. 

4.            SECURITY INTEREST .  The Company hereby grants the Noteholder a security interest in all of the Company s assets and property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, wherever located, and whether now or hereafter existing or arising (collectively, the  Collateral ), including, without limitation, all cash, equipment, inventory, accounts, notes, contracts, general intangibles and proceeds of any and all of the Collateral. The security interest created hereunder is pari passu with any other holder(s) of Notes.  This security interest is granted to secure the debt evidenced by this note and agreement. The Company will prepare and file a UCC financing statement in the state of Nevada, or whatever documents are necessary to perfect Noteholder s security interest. 

5.            DEFAULT .  The occurrence of any one of the following events shall constitute an Event of Default:

(d)           A default shall occur in the payment when due (subject to any applicable grace period), whether by acceleration or otherwise, of any indebtedness of the Company or an event of default or similar event shall occur with respect to such indebtedness, if the effect of such default or event (subject to any required notice and any applicable grace period) would be to accelerate the maturity of any such indebtedness or to permit the holder or holders of such indebtedness to cause such indebtedness to become due and payable prior to its express maturity; 

(e)           The commencement by the Company of any voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment or debt, receivership, dissolution, or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect; or the adjudication of the Company as insolvent or bankrupt by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; or the petition or application by the Company for, acquiescence in, or consent by the Company to, the appointment of any receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company; or the assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors; or the written admission of the Company of its inability to pay its debts as they mature; or 

(f)           The commencement against the Company of any proceeding relating to the Company under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, adjustment of debt, receivership, dissolution or liquidation law or statute or any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect, provided, however, that the commencement of such a proceeding shall not constitute an Event of Default unless the Company consents to the same or admits in writing the material allegations of same, or said proceeding shall remain undismissed for 30 days; or the issuance of any order, judgment or decree for the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Company or for all or a substantial part of the property of the Company, which order, judgment or decree remains undismissed for 30 days; or a warrant of attachment, execution, or similar process shall be issued against any substantial part of the property of the Company. 

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Noteholder may, by written notice to the Company, declare all or any portion of the unpaid principal amount due to Noteholder, together with all accrued interest thereon, immediately due and payable.

BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC. 

WARRANT AGREEMENT 

To Purchase Shares of Common Stock 

THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, D. Fell Merwin Investment Services Trust (the  Holder ), is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on or after the date hereof, to subscribe for and purchase from, BOLLENTE COMPANIES, INC., a California corporation (the  Company ), 50,000 of the fully paid non-assessable shares of the Company s common stock ( Common Stock ) at a purchase price of $1.50 per share, provided that such right will terminate, if not terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions hereof, at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on the fifth year anniversary of the issuance of this Warrant (the  Expiration Date ).  The purchase price and the number of shares for which this warrant (the  Warrant ) is exercisable are subject to adjustment, as provided herein.  The Warrants being sold and issued pursuant to this agreement shall be evidenced by the warrant certificate attached as  Annex A  hereto (the  Warrant Certificate ).  This Warrant was issued in connection with a Subscription Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and Holder (the  Subscription Agreement ) for the sale of (i) a note bearing interest at the rate of 12% per annum, on the principal amount of $50,000 (the  Note ), and (ii) this Warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, and is subject to the terms of the Subscription Agreement; provided, however, that any that any conflict between the provisions of this Warrant and the Subscription Agreement, the provisions of this Warrant shall control.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein will have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Subscription Agreement. 

As used herein the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following respective meanings: 

(a)           The term  Company  shall include Bollente Companies, Inc., and any entity which shall succeed or assume the obligations of Bollente Companies, Inc., hereunder. 

(b)           The term  Warrant Shares  includes (i) the Company s common stock and (ii) any other securities into which or for which any of the Common Stock may be converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of recapitalization, reorganization, merger, sale of assets or otherwise. 

(c)           The term  Other Securities  refers to any stock (other than Common Stock) and other securities of the Company or any other person (corporate or otherwise) which the holder of the Warrant at any time shall be entitled to receive, or shall have received, on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or in addition to Common Stock, or which at any time shall be issuable or shall have been issued in exchange for or in replacement of Common Stock or Other Securities. 

(d)           The term  Exercise Price  shall be $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms hereof. 

(e)           The   Fair Market Value  of one share shall be defined as the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of this Warrant (the  Average Closing Price ), as reported by any over-the-counter electronic quotation system; provided, however, that if the common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the Fair Market Value shall be the Average Closing Price on such exchange for the ten trading days prior to the date of exercise of the Warrant.  If the shares of common stock are/were not traded during the ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, then the closing price for the last publicly traded day shall be deemed to be the closing price for any and all (if applicable) days during such ten trading day period. If the shares of Common Stock are/were not traded for longer than ten trading days prior to the date of the exercise, of if the shares were never publicly traded prior to the date of the exercise, the Fair Market Value of a Warrant Share shall be determined in good faith by the Company s Board of Directors. 

1.   

Number of Shares Issuable upon Exercise . 

Unless sooner terminated in accordance herewith, from and after the date hereof through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant in whole or in part, the number of Warrant Shares set forth on the first page of this Warrant, subject to adjustment pursuant hereto, by delivery of an original or fax copy of the exercise notice on the reverse side of the warrant certificate attached hereto as  Annex A   (the  Notice of Exercise ) along with payment to the Company of the Exercise Price.  The company is obligated to provide ten business days written notice to the Holder of the expiration of the warrant by US mail at the Holder s address of record and by email. 

2.       Exercise of Warrant . 

(a)           The purchase rights represented by this Warrant are exercisable by the registered Holder hereof, in whole at any time or in part from time to time by delivery of the Notice of Exercise duly completed and executed at the office of the Company in Arizona (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder hereof at the address of such Holder appearing on the books of the Company), and upon payment of the Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased (in the manner provided in Section 2(d) hereof); whereupon the Holder of this Warrant shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares so purchased; provided that the Company will place on each certificate a legend substantially the same as that appearing on this Warrant, 

in addition to any legend required by any applicable state or federal law. If this Warrant is exercised in part, the Company will issue to the Holder hereof a new Warrant upon the same terms as this Warrant but for the balance of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant remains exercisable.  The Company agrees that upon exercise of this Warrant the Holder shall be deemed to be the record owner of the Warrant Shares issued upon exercise as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid.  This Warrant will be surrendered at the time of exercise or if lost, stolen, misplaced, or destroyed, the Holder will comply with Section 7 below. 

(b)           Certificates for Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be delivered to the Holder hereof within a reasonable time after the date on which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid. 

(c)           The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive rights, taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue which shall be paid by the Company in accordance with Section 4 below). 

(d)           In order to exercise this Warrant with respect to all or any part of the Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is at the time exercisable, Holder (or any other person or persons exercising the Warrant) must take the following actions: 

(i)           Execute and deliver to the Company a written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares being purchased (in whole shares only) and such other information set forth on the form of Notice of Exercise attached hereto as Annex A; and 

(ii)           Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares in one or more of the following forms: 

(A)           Cash, check, or wire transfer; or 

(B)           A promissory note payable to the Company, but only to the extent authorized by the Company. 

3.               No Fractional Shares . 

The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant or to deliver Warrant Certificates which evidence fractional Warrant Shares.  In the event that a fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 3, be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the Company shall pay to the Holder exercising the Warrant an amount in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Warrant Share. 

4.            Charges, Taxes, and Expenses . 

Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder of this Warrant, or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder of this Warrant; provided, however, that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder of this Warrant, the Company may require, as a condition thereto, that the transferee execute an appropriate investment representation as may be reasonably required by the Company. 

5.            No Rights as Shareholders . 

This Warrant does not entitle the Holder hereof to any voting rights or other rights as a Shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof.    

6.            Exchange and Registry of Warrant . 

This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the registered Holder at the above-mentioned office or agency of the Company, for a new Warrant or Warrants aggregating the total Warrant Shares of the surrendered Warrant of like tenor and dated as of such exchange.  The Company shall maintain at the above-mentioned office or agency a registry showing the name and address of the registered Holder of this Warrant.  This Warrant may be surrendered for exchange, transfer, or exercise, in accordance with its terms, at such office or agency of the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to rely in all respects, prior to written notice to the contrary, upon such registry. 

7.            Loss, Theft, Destruction, or Mutilation of Warrant . 

Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and upon reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor (but with no additional rights or obligations) and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of this Warrant. 

8.            Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc.  

If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall be a Saturday or a Sunday or shall be a legal holiday, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding day not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. 

9.            Cash Distributions . 

No adjustment on account of cash dividends or interest on the Company s Common Stock or Other Securities that may become purchasable hereunder will be made to the Exercise Price under this Warrant. 

10.            Consolidation, Merger, or Sale of the Company . 

If the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets which reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock, the successor corporation (or corporation controlling the successor corporation or the Company, as the case may be) shall by operation of law assume the Company s obligations under this Warrant.  Upon consummation of such transaction, the Warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other assets which the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation, merger, or transfer if the holder had exercised the Warrant immediately before the effective date of such transaction.  As a condition to the consummation of such transaction, the Company shall arrange for the person or entity obligated to issue securities or deliver cash or other assets upon exercise of the Warrant to, concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, assume the Company s obligations hereunder by executing an instrument so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section 10. 

11.            Adjustments for Stock Splits, Combinations, etc.  

The number of shares and class of capital stock purchasable under this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 11. 

(a)           Adjustment for change in capital stock.  If the Company: 

(i)           pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock, in each case, in shares of its Common Stock; 

(ii)           subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; 

(iii)           combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares; 

(iv)           makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or 

(v)           issues by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any shares of its capital stock; 

then the number and classes of shares purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised may receive the number and classes of shares of capital stock of the Company which such holder would have owned immediately following such action if such holder had exercised the Warrant immediately prior to such action. 

For a dividend or distribution the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the dividend or distribution.  For a subdivision, combination, or reclassification, the adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of the subdivision, combination, or reclassification. 

If after an adjustment the Holder, upon exercise of a Warrant, may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company shall in good faith determine the allocation of the adjusted Exercise Price between or among the classes of capital stock.  After such allocation, that portion of the Exercise Price applicable to each share of each such class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the allocation of the Exercise Price between or among shares of capital stock as provided by this Section 11(a), a Warrant may only be exercised in full by payment of the entire Exercise Price currently in effect. 

(b)           The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 11 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the exercise rights of the Holders of this Warrant against impairment. 

12.            Certificate as to Adjustments . 

In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the exercise of the Warrant, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the Holder of the Warrant and any Warrant agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 16 hereof). 

13.            Reservation of Stock Issuable on Exercise of Warrant . 

The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery on the exercise of the Warrant, shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant. 

14.            Assignment; Exchange of Warrant . 

Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant, and the rights evidenced hereby, may be transferred by any registered Holder hereof (a  Transferor ) with respect to any or all of the shares underlying this Warrant.  On the surrender for exchange of this Warrant, together with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company demonstrating compliance with applicable securities laws, which shall include, without limitation, a legal opinion from the Transferor s counsel that such transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of applicable securities laws, the Company at its expense (but with payment by the Transferor of any applicable transfer taxes) will issue and deliver to or on the order of the Transferor thereof a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of the Transferor and/or the transferee(s) specified (each a  Transferee ), calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of Warrant Shares called for on the face or faces of the Warrant so surrendered by the Transferor; and provided further, that upon any such transfer, the Company may require, as a condition thereto, that the Transferee execute an appropriate investment representation as may be reasonably required by the Company. 

15.            Rule 144 Rights . 

The Company will provide any and all legal opinions required for the removal of the restrictive legend from any stock certificate(s) issued upon exercise of this Warrant under Rule 144, at the Company s expense.  The Company shall process any request for removal of the restrictive legend within ten business days.  If the Company fails to process any legal request for removal of restrictive legends for more than ten business days after receipt of a written request to do so, the Company shall pay the Holder or stockholder, as applicable, a cash penalty of 1% per day of the Fair Market Value of the securities whose legends were requested to be removed. 

16.            Warrant Agent . 

The Company may, by written notice to each Holder of a Warrant, appoint an agent for the purpose of issuing Warrant Shares (or Other Securities) on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 2, exchanging this Warrant pursuant to Section 14, and replacing this Warrant pursuant to Section 7, or any of the foregoing, and thereafter any such issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such agent.

(c)           There is a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Company;

LOAN AGREEMENT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  

THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  (  Loan Agreement  ) is made as of the 2nd day of August, 2016, by  Bollente Companies Inc. , a Nevada corporation (  Borrower  ), as borrower, and  Built-Right Holdings, LLC , an Arizona limited liability company (" Lender "), as lender. 

Background  

Borrower is in the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling Trutankless Water Heaters, and desires to borrow from Lender an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in lawful money of the United States of America (the   Maximum Loan Amount  ), for the purpose set forth in this Loan Agreement.  For the independent consideration set forth below, Lender is willing to loan such amount to Borrower on the terms and conditions set forth in this Loan Agreement. 

Agreement  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the parties  respective promises stated herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Borrower and Lender agree as follows:

2.01      Commitment to Lend .  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and in reliance on Borrower's representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, Lender agrees to loan to Borrower the Initial Advance, and at Lender s option, such Additional Advances as Lender deems appropriate, the total amount of which shall not exceed the Maximum Loan Amount.  The Loan shall be evidenced by this Loan Agreement and by the Note made by Borrower to the order of Lender and shall bear interest and be paid upon the terms and conditions provided herein. 

(a)      Initial Advance .  Upon the full execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by Borrower and Lender, and Borrower s payment to Lender of the Independent Consideration, Lender shall make an initial advance in the amount of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) (" Initial Advance ") against the Maximum Loan Amount. 

(b)      Additional Advances .  Upon Borrower s written request, and in Lender s sole and absolute discretion, Lender shall have the option (but not the obligation) to make the following additional advances (individually, an   Additional Advance   and, collectively, the   Additional Advances  ), in the aggregate amount of which, together with the Initial Advance, shall not exceed the Maximum Loan Amount:  Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000) on November 1, 2016; Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($225,000) on February 1, 2017;and Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) on May 1, 2017. 

(c)      Draws/Use of Advances .  Borrower shall deposit each Advance into the Segregated Account.  Except as otherwise agreed by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion, all funds, from whatever source (including but not limited to the Advances) deposited to the Segregated Account shall be distributed by Borrower from the Segregated Account as follows:  (i) not less than eighty percent (80%) of all distributions from the Segregated Account shall be used by Borrower to pay for the manufacture and delivery of Trutankless Water Heaters; and (ii) the balance of all distributions (i.e., an amount not to exceed twenty percent (20%)) may be used by Borrower to pay general operating expenses and overhead.  In addition to the Advances, until the Loan is satisfied in full, Borrower shall deposit into the Segregated Account all revenues from the sale of Trutankless Water Heaters, which amounts shall be subject to the same restrictions on distributions set forth above in this  Section 2.01(c) .  During the term of the Loan, Lender shall have unrestricted view access to the Segregated Account.  In addition, Borrower agrees to provide to Lender, promptly upon request, any backup or supporting information maintained by Borrower regarding deposits to, or disbursements from the Segregated Account. 

2.02      Calculation of Interest .  Interest on each Advance shall accrue at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date such Advance is issued until paid in full. 

2.03      Payment of Principal and Interest . 

(a)      Due Date .  The Loan shall be due and payable in full on the first to occur of the following (the   Due Date  ):  (i) one hundred twenty (120) days after delivery of Payment Notice by Lender, and (ii) August 1, 2018.  Subject to the terms of  subsection (b)  below, on or before the Due Date, Borrower shall pay the entire then current outstanding principal balance of the Loan, together with all accrued interest thereon and all other amounts due under this Loan Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document (collectively, the   Loan Amount  ).  The term   Payment Notice   means a written demand for payment delivered by Lender to Borrower at any time from and after February 1, 2017, but prior to August 1, 2018. 

(b)      Prepayment .  Borrower has the right to elect to prepay the Loan, in full but not in part, at any time prior to the Due Date upon not less than thirty (30) days  advance written notice to Lender (the   Prepayment Election  ).  During the thirty (30) day notice period, the Loan shall be deemed due and payable, and subject to Lender s stock conversion rights under  Section 3.01  below and the Note.  If Borrower exercises the Prepayment Election, and on the conditions that (i) the principal balance of the Loan is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and (ii) Lender elects to convert the then current Loan Amount to stock as provided in  Section 3.01 , then and under those conditions, Borrower shall be obligated to issue to Lender, as a prepayment penalty, a Warrant to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock at the price of $0.25 per share, exercisable within five (5) years of issuance.  The number of shares of stock subject to the Warrant shall be equal to the difference between (x) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock at $0.25 per share that would have been acquired by Lender upon conversion of the full Maximum Loan Amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), with interest at twelve percent (12%) through August 1, 2018, and (y) the actual number of shares of Class A Common Stock acquired by Lender on the conversion of the Loan Amount. 

2.04      Payments Generally . 

(a)      Delivery of Payments .  All payments due to Lender under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents are to be paid in immediately available United States funds to Lender at Lender's notice address set forth at  Section 9.01  hereof, or at such other place as Lender may designate to Borrower in writing from time to time.  All amounts due under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be paid without setoff, counterclaim or any other deduction whatsoever. 

(b)      Default Interest Rate .  If the Loan is not paid in full on the Due Date,   or if the Loan is accelerated following an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the interest rate then payable on the Loan shall immediately increase to eighteen percent (18%) (  Default Rate  ) and continue to accrue at the Default Rate until full payment is received.   Interest at the Default Rate also shall accrue on any judgment obtained by Lender in connection with collection of the Loan or enforcement of any Obligations due under the other Loan Documents until such judgment amount is paid in full. 

(c)      Application of Payments .  Lender's acceptance of a payment from Borrower in an amount that is less than the full amount then due and Lender's application of such payments to amounts then due from Borrower shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. 

ARTICLE 3

3.01      Conversion of Note .  At any time prior to the payment in full of the Note, without regard to whether an event of default exists, at the option of Lender, Lender may convert the then current Loan Amount into Class A Common Stock of Borrower at a conversion price of $0.25 per share, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Note.

(f)     Except for the specific defaults set forth in this  Section 6.01 , if any other default or failure to perform occurs hereunder or under any other Loan Document which is not cured (i) in the case of any default which can be cured by the payment of money, within five (5) days after written notice from Lender to Borrower; or (ii) in the case of any other default, within thirty (30) days after written notice from Lender to Borrower;  provided  that if a default under clause (ii) cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and Borrower has taken commercially reasonable steps to cure such default promptly upon notice thereof from Lender and thereafter diligently proceeds to cure same, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended for so long as it shall require Borrower, in the exercise of due diligence, to cure such default, but in no event shall the entire cure period be more than sixty (60) days. 

6.02      Remedies .  If an Event of Default occurs, Lender may, at its option, and without prior notice or demand, do and hereby is authorized and empowered by Borrower so to do, any or all of the following: 

(a)      Acceleration .  Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal balance of the Loan to be immediately due and payable. 

(b)      Recovery of Unpaid Sums .  Lender may, from time to time, take legal action to recover any sums as the same become due, without regard to whether or not the Loan shall be accelerated and without prejudice to Lender's right thereafter to accelerate the Loan or exercise any other remedy, if such sums remain uncollected. 

(c)      Foreclosure of Security Interest .  Lender may foreclose on the Security Interest as provided in  Section 3.02 , and exercise its rights pursuant to the Assignment of Contracts.

Lender's remedies under this Loan Agreement are cumulative (whether set forth in this Article 6 or in any other section of this Loan Agreement) with those in the other Loan Documents and otherwise permitted by law or in equity and may be exercised independently, concurrently or successively in Lender's sole discretion and as often as occasion therefor shall arise.  Lender's delay or failure to accelerate the Loan or exercise any other remedy upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall not be deemed a waiver of such right as remedy.  No partial exercise by Lender of any right or remedy will preclude further exercise thereof.  Notice or demand given to Borrower in any instance will not entitle Borrower to notice or demand in similar or other circumstances (except where notice is expressly required by this Loan Agreement to be given) nor constitute Lender's waiver of its right to take any future action in any circumstance without notice or demand. Lender may release security for the Loan, may release any party liable therefor, may grant extensions, renewals or forbearances with respect thereto, may accept a partial or past due payment or grant other indulgences, or may apply any other security held by it to payment of the Loan, in each case without prejudice to its rights under the Loan Documents and without such action being deemed an accord and satisfaction or a reinstatement of the Loan.  Lender will not be deemed as a consequence of its delay or failure to act, or any forbearance granted, to have waived or be estopped from exercising any of its rights or remedies. 

6.04      Enforcement Costs .  Borrower shall pay, on demand by Lender all costs, expenses, charges and fees incurred by Lender in (a) connection with the negotiation, documentation, closing, administration, servicing and interpretation of the Loan and the Loan Documents, (b) collecting any amount payable under the Loan Documents, and (c) enforcing its rights under the Loan Documents, in each case whether or not legal proceedings are commenced or whether legal action is pursued to final judgment.  Amounts incurred by Lender shall be added to the principal balance of the Loan, shall be immediately due and payable, shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of disbursement until paid in full, if not paid in full within five (5) days after Lender's written demand for payment, and such amounts shall be secured by the collateral given to secure the Loan. 

ARTICLE 7  

FURTHER ACTS AND ASSURANCES  

7.01      Further Acts .  Borrower, at Borrower's expense, agrees to take such further actions and execute such further documents as Lender reasonably may request to carry out the intent of the Loan Documents or to establish and protect the rights and remedies created or intended to be created in favor of Lender under the Loan Documents.  Borrower agrees to pay all filing, registration or recording fees or taxes, and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgement, or filing/recording of the security instruments, or any such instrument of further assurance, except where prohibited by law so to do.

ARTICLE 8 

LENDER CONSENT

8.02      Lender Approval .  Wherever pursuant to a Loan Document (a) Lender exercises any right to approve or disapprove or to grant or withhold consent; (b) any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory to Lender; (c) a waiver is requested from Lender, or (d) any other decision is to be made by Lender, all shall be made in Lender's sole discretion, unless expressly provided otherwise in such Loan Document.  By approving or granting consent, accepting performance from Borrower, or releasing funds, Lender shall not be deemed to have warranted or affirmed the sufficiency, completeness, legality or effectiveness of the subject matter or of Borrower's compliance with Requirements of Laws.  Notwithstanding any provision under the Loan Documents which provide Lender the opportunity to approve or disapprove any action or decision by Borrower, Lender is not undertaking the performance of any obligation of Borrower under any of the Loan Documents or any of the other documents and agreements in connection with this transaction.

ARTICLE 1 

TERMS OF NOTE  

1.01            Loan Agreement .  This Convertible Promissory Note (this   Note  ) is the promissory note referred to in the Loan Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meaning provided in the Loan Agreement. All of the terms, conditions and provisions of the Loan Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. 

1.02            Negotiable Instrument .  Borrower agrees that this Note is a negotiable instrument, even though this Note, absent this paragraph, may not otherwise qualify as a negotiable instrument under applicable law. 

1.03            Borrower s Waivers .  Borrower, for itself and all others who may become liable for payment of all or any portion of this Note, hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice of dishonor, protest, nonpayment, demand, intent to accelerate, and acceleration. 

1.04            Unconditional Payment .  Any payment received by Lender hereunder that is required to be refunded or recovered from Lender as a voidable preference or fraudulent transfer or is otherwise set aside pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or any insolvency or other debtor relief law shall not be considered as payment made on the Loan or under this Note.  Borrower s liability under this Note to make such payment shall be reinstated, notwithstanding that this Note may have been marked satisfied and returned to Borrower or otherwise canceled, and such payment shall be immediately due and payable upon demand. 

1.05            Conversion .  At the option of Lender in its sole and absolute discretion and without regard to whether an Event of Default exists, the then outstanding principal amount of this Note, along with all accrued interest hereunder (the   Loan Amount  ) shall be converted, in whole, in part, or in a series of conversions, into Class A Common Stock of the Borrower (  Shares  ) at a conversion price of $0.25 per share.  To convert the Loan Amount to Shares, Lender shall deliver to Borrower at the notice address set forth in Section 9.01 of the Loan Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, (a) an Election to Convert (the   Election  ) in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit  A  , and (b) an executed Subscription and Representations and Warranties Agreement (  Subscription Agreement  ) in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit  B  .  No later than fourteen (14) business days after Lender s issuance of the Election, Borrower shall issue and cause to be delivered to Lender, and in such name or names as Lender may designate, a certificate or certificates for the full number of Shares so purchased upon conversion of the Note, and the same shall be entered on Borrower s stock transfer books.  Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such securities as of the date of the Election, notwithstanding that the certificate or certificates representing such securities shall not yet have actually been delivered or that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed.  The amount of the Note so converted shall be deemed to be a credit against the Loan Amount owing on the date of the Election. 

1.06            Senior Indebtedness .  Borrower hereby represents, warrants and covenants that this Note is, and shall remain until paid in full, senior in the right of payment to all other Indebtedness of Borrower. For purposes of this Note,   Indebtedness   shall mean and include the aggregate amount of, without duplication, (i) all obligations for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (iii) all obligations to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services (other than accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), (iv) all obligations with respect to capital leases, (v) all guaranty obligations, and (vi) all reimbursement and any other payment obligations, contingent or otherwise, in respect of letters of credit. 

ARTICLE 2 

DEFAULT AND REMEDIES  

2.01            Event of Default . The occurrence of an  Event of Default  as that term is defined under the Loan Agreement shall constitute an   Event of Default   under this Note. The material breach of any covenant or undertaking by Borrower in the Subscription Agreement shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder. 

2.02            Cumulative and Independent Remedies . Following an Event of Default (which has not been waived in writing by Lender), Lender, without notice or consent from Borrower shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies as have been provided to Lender hereunder, under the Loan Agreement and other Loan Documents, by law or in equity. Such rights and remedies are cumulative and may be exercised independently, concurrently or successively in Lender s sole discretion and as often as occasion therefor shall arise. No partial exercise by Lender of any right or remedy will preclude further exercise thereof. Notice or demand given to Borrower in any instance will not entitle Borrower to notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute Lender s waiver of its right to take any future action in any circumstance without notice or demand (except where expressly required by this Note to be given). Lender may release security for the Loan, may release any party liable for the Loan, may grant extensions, renewals or forbearances with respect thereto, and may apply any security held by it to payment of the Loan, in each case without prejudice to its rights under this Note. Lender will not be deemed as consequence of its delay or failure to act, or any forbearances granted, to have waived or be estopped from exercising any of its rights or remedies. 

ARTICLE 3 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  

3.01            Modification .

3.02            Unenforceable Provisions . Wherever possible, each provision of this Note shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited by or invalid, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Note. 

3.03            Governing Law . This Note was negotiated in Arizona, and made by Borrower and accepted by Lender in the State of Arizona, which State the parties agree has substantial relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction embodied hereby, and in all respects (including, without limitation, matters of construction, validity and performance), this Note and the obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Arizona applicable to contracts made and performed in such State and any applicable law of the United States of America. 

3.04            WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  . BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND AGREES NOT TO ELECT, TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ISSUE ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTE OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS BORROWER AND LENDER.
