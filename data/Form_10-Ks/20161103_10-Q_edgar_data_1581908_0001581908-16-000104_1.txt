FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain statements included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in particular under the section entitled   Part I   Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   relating to matters that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that represent management s beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. These forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry including the regulation of our industry, the expected outcomes of legal proceedings involving us or Western Refining, Inc. ("Western"), business strategy, future operations, acquisition opportunities, volatility of commodity prices, access to crude oil, demand for refined products, seasonality, gross margins, volumes, taxes, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, sources of financing for acquisitions, maintenance and capital expenditures, distributions and other financial and operating information. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or forecasts of future events. We have used the words  anticipate,   assume,   believe,   budget,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   intend,   may,   plan,   position,   potential,   predict,   project,   strategy,   will,   future  and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this report. 
  Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results or outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect or that are affected by unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many that are beyond our control that could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of factors. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all of these factors, they include, among others, the following: 
             
    changes in the business strategy or activity levels of Western that may be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in crack spreads, changes in the spread between West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil and West Texas Sour ("WTS") crude oil, also known as the sweet/sour spread, changes in the spread between Western Canadian Select ("WCS") and WTI crude oil, changes in the spread between WTI crude oil and Dated Brent crude oil and between WTI Cushing crude oil and WTI Midland crude oil, and Western's post-merger integration with Northern Tier Energy LP; 
                
    changes in general economic conditions, including the price volatility of crude oil; 
                
    competitive conditions in our industry; 
                
    actions taken by third-party operators, processors and transporters; 
                
    the demand for crude oil, refined and other products and transportation and storage services; 
                
    the supply of crude oil in the regions in which we and Western operate; 
                
    interest rates; 
                
    labor relations; 
                
    changes in the availability and cost of capital; 
                
    changes in tax status; 
                
    operating hazards, natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters, including those that may result in a force majeure event under our commercial agreements with Western, that may be beyond our control; 
                
    the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted and implemented; 
                
    changes in insurance markets impacting costs and the level and types of coverage available; 
                
    disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure at our facilities, Western s facilities or third-party facilities on which our business is dependent;

other factors discussed in more detail herein and under   Part I.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
     Any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and could influence whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating our forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
  Although we believe the forward-looking statements we make in this report related to our plans, intentions and expectations are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. These statements are based on assumptions made by us based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many that are beyond our control. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date of this report and we are not required to (and will not) update any information to reflect events or circumstances that may occur after the date of this report, except as required by applicable law.

1.    Organization    
  Western Refining Logistics, LP ("WNRL" or the "Partnership"), "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Western Refining Logistics, LP, and, unless the context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries. References to  Western  refer to Western Refining, Inc. WNRL is a Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2013, by Western Refining Logistics GP, LLC ("WRGP" or the "General Partner"), our general partner. WRGP is   100%   owned by Western and holds all general partner interests in WNRL, all of which are non-economic interests. As of   September 30, 2016  , Western owned   52.6%   of the limited partner interest in WNRL and public unitholders held the remaining   47.4%  . See   Note 11, Equity  , for additional information.  
  WNRL is principally a fee-based growth-oriented partnership that was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics and related assets and businesses including terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistics assets related to the terminalling, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil and refined products. WNRL's businesses include   692   miles of pipelines,   12.4 million   barrels of active terminal and pipeline storage capacity, distribution of wholesale petroleum products and crude oil and asphalt trucking. 
  On   September 15, 2016  ,   we acquired certain terminalling, transportation and storage assets from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western consisting of the Cottage Grove tank farm and certain terminals and storage assets located on site at Western's St. Paul Park refinery ("St. Paul Park Logistics Assets"). The St. Paul Park Logistics Assets primarily receive, store and distribute crude oil, feedstock and refined products associated with Western's St. Paul Park refinery  .   We acquired the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets from Western in exchange for     $195 million   in cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. We refer to this transaction as the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  ."   This transaction was between entities under common control and we recorded the purchase of the     St. Paul Park Logistics Assets     at Western's historical book value as required by GAAP  . We funded the cash portion of the consideration through a combination of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility and   $174.7 million   of cash on hand, primarily generated from our equity offering of   8,625,000   common units during the third quarter of 2016. See   Note 3, Acquisitions of Common Control Assets  , for additional information.  
  On   September 7, 2016  ,   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of     7,500,000     common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. See   Note 11, Equity  , for additional information.  
  On May 16, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of   3,750,000   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. We also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to   562,500   additional common units on the same terms, which was exercised in full and closed on June 1, 2016. See   Note 11, Equity  , for additional information.  
  On October 30, 2015, WNRL acquired a segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system from Western that currently extends from our crude oil station in Star Lake, New Mexico, in the Four Corners region to our T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the "  TexNew Mex Pipeline System  "). We also acquired an   80,000   barrel crude oil storage tank located at our crude oil pumping station in Star Lake, New Mexico and certain other related assets ("TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition") from Western. We acquired these assets in exchange for   $170 million   in cash,   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   units of a class of limited partner interests in WNRL referred to as the "TexNew Mex Units." This transaction was between entities under common control and we recorded the purchase of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System assets at Western's historical book value as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). See   Note 3, Acquisitions of Common Control Assets  , for additional information.  
  The financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retrospectively adjusted to include the combined financial results of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   prior to   September 15, 2016  , and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System prior to October 30, 2015. The historical operations of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   prior to the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   generally recorded operating costs and other expenses associated with storage and terminalling services and recorded no revenue. For periods subsequent to the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  , the results of operations for the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   will reflect revenues based on contractual rates set forth in our commercial agreements with Western. See   Note 17, Related Party Transactions  , for additional information.

  2.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  , or for any other period. We have not reported comprehensive income due to the absence of items of other comprehensive income or loss during the periods presented. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Financial Instruments and Fair Value  
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable. We believe that our credit risk is minimized as a result of the credit quality of our customer base. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, which we consider Level 1 assets, approximated their fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , due to their short-term maturities. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the accounting and reporting requirements included in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") for consolidation of limited partnerships or similar entities. We have applied the new standards retrospectively. The adoption of these revised standards did not result in any change to our consolidation conclusions or impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related reporting and disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
             
    Recognition and reporting of revenues - the requirements were amended to remove inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The revised standard s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised standard also addresses principal versus agent considerations and indicators related to transfer of control over specified goods. These provisions are effective January 1, 2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  
                
    Lease accounting - the requirements were amended with regard to recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing information about leasing arrangements. The core principle is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. 
                
    Employee share-based payment accounting - the requirements involve several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification in the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. These provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.

Cash flow statement - the requirements address certain classification issues related to the statement of cash flows. These provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. 
                
    Contingent put and call options in debt instruments - the requirements will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments and clarify the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the  clearly and closely  criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. 
      
  3.    Acquisitions of Common Control Assets    
  The transactions described below are acquisitions in which we purchased assets from wholly-owned subsidiaries of Western. Each transaction represents a transfer of assets between entities under common control and, as such, we have recorded the transactions at the historical book value of the assets as required by GAAP. The financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retrospectively adjusted to include the combined financial results of the assets related to the following common control transactions. 
  St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction 
  On   September 15, 2016  , we acquired the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   from Western in exchange for   $195 million   in cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL.  
  The   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   acquired by WNRL included approximately   4.0 million   barrels of refined product and crude oil storage tanks, a light products terminal, a heavy products loading rack, certain rail and barge facilities, certain other related logistics assets and   two   crude oil pipeline segments and   one   pipeline segment not currently in service, each of which is approximately   2.5   miles and extends from Western's refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota to Western's tank farm in Cottage Grove, Minnesota. 
  In connection with the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  , we entered into a terminalling, transportation and storage services agreement with Western (the "  St. Paul Park Terminalling Agreement  "). Pursuant to the   St. Paul Park Terminalling Agreement  , we agreed to provide product storage services, product throughput services and product additive and blending services at the terminal facilities located at or near Western's refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota. In exchange for such services, Western has agreed to certain minimum volume commitments and to pay certain fees. The   St. Paul Park Terminalling Agreement   has an initial term of ten years, which may be extended for up to two renewal terms of five years each upon the mutual agreement of the parties. See   Note 17, Related Party Transactions  , for additional information.  
  TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition 
  On October 30, 2015, WNRL acquired the TexNew Mex Pipeline System in exchange for   $170 million   in cash,   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   TexNew Mex Units. We entered into an amendment to our pipeline and gathering services agreement with Western in connection with the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition. 
   
  4.    Segment Information    
  Our operations are organized into   two   operating segments based on marketing criteria and the nature of our products and services and our types of customers. These segments are logistics and wholesale. 
  Logistics.   Our pipeline and gathering assets are positioned to support crude oil supply for Western's El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park refineries as well as third parties and consist of crude oil pipelines and gathering assets located primarily in the Delaware Basin, in the Four Corners area of Northwestern New Mexico and in the Upper Great Plains region. These systems gather and transport crude oil by pipeline from various production locations to Western s refineries utilizing   692   miles of pipeline;   33   crude oil storage tanks with a total combined active shell storage capacity of   959,000   barrels,   eight   truck loading and unloading locations and   15   pump stations. 
  Our terminalling, transportation and storage assets support crude oil supply and refined product distribution for Western's El Paso, Gallup and St. Paul Park refineries as well as third parties and primarily consist of storage tanks, terminals, transportation and other assets located in El Paso, Texas; Gallup, Bloomfield and Albuquerque, New Mexico; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona and the Upper Great Plains region. These assets include crude oil, feedstock, blendstock, refined product and

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

asphalt storage tanks with a total combined shell storage capacity of   11.4 million   barrels; truck, railcar and barge loading racks; pump stations and pipeline and related logistics assets to service Western s operations. 
  We recorded the purchase of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System assets at Western's historical book value as required by GAAP. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information for WNRL, to include the historical results of the assets acquired, for periods prior to the effective date of the transactions.  
  Wholesale.   Our wholesale segment includes the operations of several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of crude oil, refined product, asphalt and lubricant delivery trucks. Our wholesale segment distributes commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. The wholesale segment purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from Western's refining segment and from third-party suppliers. 
  During the second and third quarters of 2016, we disposed of certain assets related to our lubricant sales in California. In connection with these asset disposals, we reported employee severance costs of   $0.4 million   within direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . A gain of   $0.6 million   has been included in gain on disposal of assets, net for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Segment Accounting Principles.   Operating income for each segment consists of net revenues less cost of products sold; direct operating expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; net impact of the disposal of assets and depreciation and amortization.  
  Activities of our business that are not included in the   two   segments mentioned above are included in the Other category. Other activities consist primarily of corporate staff operations and items that are not specific to the normal business of any one of our   two   operating segments.  
  The total assets of each segment consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents; inventories; net accounts receivable; net property, plant and equipment; net intangible assets and net other assets directly associated with the individual segment s operations. Included in the total assets of the corporate operations are cash and cash equivalents, various net accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long-term assets.

Payments made to our unitholders are determined in relation to actual distributions declared and are not based on the net income or loss allocations used in the calculation of earnings per unit. 
  Diluted earnings per unit includes the effects of potentially dilutive units of our common units that consist of unvested phantom units. These units are non-participating securities due to the forfeitable nature of their associated distribution equivalent rights prior to vesting. We do not consider these units under the two-class method when calculating earnings per unit. Basic and diluted earnings per unit applicable to subordinated limited partners are the same because there are   no   potentially dilutive subordinated units outstanding. 
  In addition to the common and subordinated units, we have identified the general partner interest, incentive distribution rights and distributions associated with the TexNew Mex Units as participating securities and use the two-class method when calculating earnings per unit applicable to limited partners that is based on the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period. We make incentive distribution payments to our General Partner when our per unit distribution amount exceeds the target distribution. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made incentive distribution right payments to our General Partner of   $1.2 million  ,   $2.9 million  ,   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. Refer to   Note 11, Equity  , for further information regarding incentive distribution rights. 
  To the extent there is sufficient available cash from operating surplus under the Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement (the "Second A R Partnership Agreement"), the holder of the TexNew Mex Units will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to   80%   of the excess of TexNew Mex Shared Segment Distributable Cash Flow over the TexNew Mex Base Amount (as such terms are defined in the Second A R Partnership Agreement). To the extent the holder of a TexNew Mex Unit is entitled to such a distribution, that distribution will be preferential to all other unit holder distributions. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the TexNew Mex unitholders were not entitled to any distributions. Refer to   Note 11, Equity  , for further information.

  Revolving Credit Facility 
  In connection with the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  , on September 15, 2016, we entered into a Commitment Increase and First Amendment to Credit Agreement (the  Amendment ) to our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") to bring the total commitment to   $500.0 million  . The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 16, 2018. We have the ability to increase the total commitment of our Revolving Credit Facility by up to   $150.0 million   for a total facility size of up to   $650.0 million  , subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders and to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a   $25.0 million   sub-limit for standby letters of credit and a   $10.0 million   sub-limit for swing line loans. Obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain cash management and hedging obligations are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' significant assets. Our creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility have no recourse to Western's assets. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   0.75%   to   1.75%  , or at   LIBOR   plus an applicable margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.75%  . The applicable margin will vary based on our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility.  
   Pursuant to the Amendment, certain existing lenders and new lenders agreed to provide incremental commitments in an aggregate principal amount of   $200.0 million  . In addition, the Amendment amended the Revolving Credit Facility by, among other things, (a) adding an anti-cash hoarding provision and (b) permitting the Partnership to increase the total leverage ratio permitted thereunder from   4.50  :  1.00   to   5.00  :  1.00   following any material permitted acquisition through the last day of the second full fiscal quarter following such acquisition. The incremental commitments established by the Amendment benefit from the same covenants, events of default, guarantees and security as the existing commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. We incurred financing costs associated with the Amendment of   $1.0 million  . 
  On October 15, 2014, to partially fund the purchase of certain assets from Western, we borrowed   $269.0 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility. On February 11, 2015, we repaid our outstanding direct borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of our   7.5%   Senior Notes, discussed below. On October 30, 2015, we borrowed   $145.0 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility to partially fund the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid these direct borrowings using the net proceeds generated from our equity

offering during the second quarter of 2016 and from cash-on-hand. On September 15, 2016, we borrowed   $20.3 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility, to partially fund the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was   $479.0 million  . This availability is net of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings and   $0.7 million   in outstanding letters of credit. We had   no   swing line borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . The estimated fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility approximates its carrying amount. The interest rate for the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility was   4.50%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The unamortized financings costs of   $2.0 million   and   $1.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are included in long-term debt, less current portion, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, on the Revolving Credit Facility was   3.34%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make cash distributions. We are required to maintain certain financial ratios; each tested on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period.  
  7.5%   Senior Notes  
  On February 11, 2015, we entered into an Indenture (the  Indenture ) among the Partnership, WNRL Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and   100%   owned subsidiary of the Partnership ( Finance Corp.  and together with the Partnership, the  Issuers ), the Guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  Trustee ) under which the Issuers issued   $300.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.5%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the "WNRL 2023 Senior Notes"). The Partnership will pay interest on the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2015. The WNRL 2023 Senior Notes will mature on February 15, 2023. Proceeds from the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes were used to repay   $269.0 million   of then outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes was   $310.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We incurred financing costs associated with the issuance of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes of   $6.8 million  . Unamortized financings costs of   $5.4 million   and   $6.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are included in long-term debt, less current portion, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, on the   7.5%   Senior Notes was   7.78%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The WNRL 2023 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of WNRL's current   100%   owned subsidiaries, with the exception of Finance Corp. Finance Corp. is a minor subsidiary of WNRL and is a co-issuer of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes. The co-issuance between WNRL and Finance Corp. is on a joint and several basis. WNRL has no independent assets or operations. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of WNRL or its subsidiary guarantors and Finance Corp. to obtain or transfer funds from its subsidiary guarantors by dividend or loan. None of the subsidiary guarantors  or Finance Corp.'s assets represent restricted assets. 
  The subsidiary guarantees of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes are subject to certain automatic customary releases, including upon the sale, disposition or transfer of capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets (including by way of merger or consolidation) of a subsidiary guarantor to a person other than the Partnership or one of its restricted subsidiaries, designation of a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the Indenture, a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, liquidation or dissolution of the subsidiary guarantor and a subsidiary guarantor ceasing to guarantee debt of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or any other guarantor under a credit facility other than the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes. The Partnership s subsidiaries may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their properties or assets to, or consolidate with or merge into, another company if such a sale would cause a default under the Indenture. 
  The Indenture contains covenants that limit WNRL s and its restricted subsidiaries  ability to, among other things: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred units, (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness, (iii) pay distributions on equity securities, repurchase equity securities or redeem subordinated indebtedness, (iv) make investments, (v) effect distributions, loans or other asset transfers from the Partnership s restricted subsidiaries, (vi) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of the Partnership s properties to, another person, (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in subsidiaries and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. The Indenture would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all the then outstanding WNRL 2023 Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately in the event of default.

11.    Equity 
  We had   28,866,477   publicly held outstanding common units as of   September 30, 2016  , including the net settlement and issuance of   62,216   common units upon the vesting of phantom units from our Western Refining Logistics, LP 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Western owned   9,207,847   of our common units and   22,811,000   of our subordinated units constituting an aggregate limited partner interest of   52.6%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  On   September 7, 2016  ,   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of     7,500,000     common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. We used the net proceeds generated from our equity offering to partially fund the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   and to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  On May 16, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of   3,750,000   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. We also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to   562,500   additional common units on the same terms, which was exercised in full and closed on June 1, 2016.   We used the net proceeds generated from our equity offering to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility during the period.    
  In accordance with our partnership agreement, Western's subordinated units will convert to common units once we have met specified distribution targets and successfully met other criteria set forth in our Second A R Partnership Agreement.  
  Changes to equity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were as follows:

TexNew Mex Units 
  The Second A R Partnership Agreement created the TexNew Mex Shared Segment and the TexNew Mex Units. The TexNew Mex units are generally entitled to participate in   80%     of the economics attributable to the TexNew Mex Shared Segment resulting from crude oil throughput on the TexNew Mex shared segment above the     13,000     bpd. To the extent there is sufficient available cash from operating surplus under the Second A R Partnership Agreement, the holder of the TexNew Mex Units will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to     80%     of the excess of TexNew Mex Shared Segment Distributable Cash Flow over the TexNew Mex Base Amount (as such terms are defined in the Second A R Partnership Agreement). To the extent the holder of a TexNew Mex Unit is entitled to such a distribution, that distribution will be preferential to all other unit holder distributions.   We declared   no   distributions to TexNew Mex unitholders related to our operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Holders of TexNew Mex Units generally do not have voting rights, except for limited voting rights related to amendments to the rights of holders of the TexNew Mex Units, the issuance of additional TexNew Mex Units or partnership securities with distribution rights senior to or on a parity with the TexNew Mex Units, the sale of any material portion of the TexNew Mex Pipeline and the reservation by the Partnership of any distribution amounts to which the holders of TexNew Mex Units are otherwise entitled.  
  The TexNew Mex Units are perpetual and have no rights of redemption or of conversion. No holder of any TexNew Mex Unit may transfer any or all of the TexNew Mex Units held by such holder without the prior written approval of the General Partner, unless the transfer either is to an affiliate of the holder or is to any person who is, or will be substantially concurrently with the completion of the transfer, an affiliate of the General Partner. 
  Issuance of Additional Interests 
  Our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue additional partnership interests for consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by our General Partner without the approval of the unitholders. We may fund future acquisitions through the issuance of additional common units, subordinated units or other partnership interests. Holders of any additional common units we issue will be entitled to share proportionally in accordance with their respective percentage interests with the then-existing common unitholders in our distributions of available cash.  
  Allocations of Net Income and Loss 
  The Second A R Partnership Agreement contains provisions for the allocation of net income and loss to the unitholders and the General Partner. For purposes of maintaining partner capital accounts, the Second A R Partnership Agreement specifies that items of income and loss shall be allocated among the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interest. Normal allocations according to percentage interests are made after giving effect, if any, to priority income allocations in an amount equal to incentive distribution right payments allocated   100%   to the General Partner. 
  Percentage Allocations of Available Cash from Operating Surplus 
  The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between the unitholders and our General Partner (as the holder of our incentive distribution rights) based on the specified target distribution levels, subject to the preferential distribution rights of holders of the TexNew Mex Units. The amounts set forth under the column heading "Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions" are the percentage interests of our General Partner and the unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column "Total Quarterly Distribution per Unit Target Amount." The percentage interests shown for our unitholders and our General Partner for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth below assume our General Partner has not transferred its incentive distribution rights and there are   no   arrearages on common units.

Our Second A R Partnership Agreement sets forth the calculation to be used to determine the amount and priority of cash distributions that the common and subordinated unitholders and general partner will receive. We declare distributions subsequent to quarter end. The table below summarizes our   2016   quarterly distribution declarations, payments and scheduled payments: 

During 2015 and 2016, we declared and paid distributions that were in excess of the target distribution amounts set forth in our partnership agreement, resulting in distributions to our General Partner as the holder of incentive distribution rights. The total quarterly cash distributions for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were as follows:  

We currently have an effective universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 that provides for the registration and sale of up to   $1 billion   of equity or debt securities of us and certain of our subsidiaries. We may over time, and subject to market conditions, in one or more offerings, offer and sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus.   During the second and third quarter of 2016, we completed equity offerings pursuant to the shelf registration statement and resulted in reduced availability.   The current availability under our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 is   $713.8 million  . 
   
  12.    Equity-Based Compensation    
  Our General Partner's board of directors adopted the LTIP for the benefit of employees, consultants and non-employee directors of our General Partner and its affiliates. Awards granted under the LTIP vest over a scheduled vesting period and their market value at the date of the grant is amortized over the restricted period on a straight-line basis.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   4,098,368   phantom units reserved for future grants under the LTIP.

The fair value of the phantom units is determined based on the closing price of WNRL common units on the grant date. The estimated fair value of the phantom units is amortized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards. We incurred unit-based compensation expense of   $0.7 million  ,   $2.0 million  ,   $0.6 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The aggregate grant date fair value of nonvested phantom units outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $7.5 million  . The aggregate intrinsic value of such phantom units was   $6.6 million  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to our non-vested phantom units totaled   $6.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.6 years  . 
  A summary of our unit award activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is set forth below: 

13.    Risk Concentration 
  We are part of the consolidated operations of Western and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from transactions with Western and its affiliates. Western accounted for   32.2%  ,   31.8%  ,   31.9%   and   30.0%  , respectively, of our total revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  We sell a variety of refined products to a diverse customer base. Sales to Kroger Company accounted for   19.3%  ,   20.2%  ,   23.1%   and   23.8%   of total revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Sales to Western s retail and unmanned fleet fueling sites accounted for   24.4%  ,   23.8%  ,   27.8%   and   26.6%   of total revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  See   Note 17, Related Party Transactions  , for detailed information on our agreements with Western. 
   
  14.    Income Taxes    
  WNRL is treated as a publicly-traded partnership for federal and state income tax purposes, however, Western Refining Product Transport, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary) is taxed as a corporation for federal and state tax purposes. Taxes on our net income for WNRL and its subsidiaries generally are borne by our partners through the allocation of taxable income. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined as we do not have access to information about each partner's tax attributes in us. Our income tax expense results from our taxable subsidiary and state laws that apply to entities organized as partnerships, primarily in the state of Texas and from federal and state laws for corporations. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our income tax expense was   $0.3 million  ,   $0.8 million  ,   $0.003 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were   3.9%  ,   3.3%  ,   0.02%   and   1.4%  , respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   unrecognized tax benefit liability.   No   interest or penalties were recognized related to income taxes during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

15.    Commitments    
  We have commitments under various operating leases with initial terms greater than one year for property, machinery and facilities. These leases have terms that will expire on various dates through   2026  . We expect that in the normal course of business, these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Rent expense for operating leases that provide for periodic rent escalations or rent holidays over the term of the lease is recognized on a straight-line basis. We also have commitments to purchase minimum volumes of refined product from Western under commercial agreements that we have entered into with Western. See   Note 17, Related Party Transactions  , for further discussion of these agreements. 
  The following table presents our annual minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases that have lease terms of one year or more (in thousands) as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Total rental expense was   $2.3 million  ,   $7.2 million  ,   $2.3 million   and   $6.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Contingent rentals and subleases were not significant in any year. 
   
  16.    Contingencies    
  Like other operators of petroleum-related storage and transportation facilities, our operations are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and we expect the cost of compliance to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is probable that a liability exists and when we can reasonably estimate the amount. We may revise such estimates in the future as regulations and other conditions change. We may receive communications from various federal, state and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective action for such asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action.  
  We are not currently aware of any environmental or other asserted or unasserted claims against us that would be expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  17.    Related Party Transactions    
  Certain of our employees are shared employees with Western. We are party to a services agreement with Western under which Western shares certain employees with us. These employees are responsible for operation and maintenance of and other services related to the assets we own and operate. Western employees provide these services under our direction, supervision and control pursuant to this services agreement. Western also provides us with support for accounting, legal, human resources and various other administrative functions.

We have incurred indirect charges from Western for the allocation of services including executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement, engineering, logistics, maintenance, information technology and similar items. We classify these indirect charges between operating and maintenance expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the functional nature of the employee and other services that Western provides for our operations. Indirect charges from Western that we include within our selling, general and administrative and operating and maintenance expenses were as follows: 

Our management believes the indirect charges allocated to us from Western are a reasonable reflection of our utilization of Western's service in connection with our operations. We also incur direct charges to support our operations and administration. The indirect allocations noted above may not fully reflect the additional expenses that we would have incurred had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. 
  Commercial Agreements with Western 
  Logistics Segment Agreements  
  We derive substantially all of our logistics revenues from   three   fee-based agreements with Western, each with initial ten-year terms subject to extension, supported by minimum volume commitments and annual adjustments to fees that we and Western may renew for two additional five-year periods upon mutual agreement. Western has committed to provide us with minimum fees based on minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil and refined and other products and reserved storage capacity.  
  Pipeline and Gathering Services Agreement 
  We are party to a pipeline and gathering services agreement, as amended, with Western under which we transport crude oil on our Permian Basin system primarily for use at Western's El Paso refinery and on our Four Corners system to Western's Gallup refinery. We charge Western fees for pipeline movements, truck offloading and product storage.  
  In connection with the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition, WNRL entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Pipeline and Gathering Services Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2013, with Western (the "Amendment of the Pipeline Agreement"). Among other things, the Amendment of the Pipeline Agreement amends the scope of the existing agreement to include the provision of storage services and a minimum volume commitment of   80,000   barrels of storage at the Star Lake storage site. In this Amendment of the Pipeline Agreement, Western provided a minimum volume commitment of   13,000   bpd of crude oil on the TexNew Mex Pipeline for 10 years from the date of the Amendment of the Pipeline Agreement.  
  In connection with the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition, the General Partner adopted certain amendments to the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership by adopting the Second A R Partnership Agreement. The amendments contained in the Second A R Partnership Agreement create a new class of limited partner interests in the Partnership, referred to as the TexNew Mex Units, and set forth the rights, preferences and obligations of the TexNew Mex Units.  
  The Second A R Partnership Agreement created the TexNew Mex Shared Segment and the TexNew Mex Units. The TexNew Mex units are generally entitled to participate in   80%     of the economics attributable to the TexNew Mex Shared Segment resulting from crude oil throughput on the TexNew Mex shared segment above the     13,000     bpd. To the extent there is sufficient available cash from operating surplus under the Second A R Partnership Agreement, the holder of the TexNew Mex Units will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to     80%     of the excess of TexNew Mex Shared Segment Distributable Cash Flow over the TexNew Mex Base Amount (as such terms are defined in the Second A R Partnership Agreement). To the extent the holder of a TexNew Mex Unit is entitled to such a distribution, that distribution will be preferential to all other unit holder

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on     Form 10-K     for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("  2015   Form 10-K") and elsewhere in this report. You should read "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in this report. In this quarterly report, all references to "WNRL," "the Partnership," "we," "us," and "our" or like terms refer to Western Refining Logistics, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. References to "Western" refer to Western Refining, Inc. 

Overview  
  WNRL is a Delaware master limited partnership that commenced operations in October 2013. Western Refining Logistics GP, LLC ("WRGP"), our general partner, holds all general partner interests, which are non-economic, in WNRL and is owned   100%   by Western.  
  WNRL is principally a fee-based, growth-oriented partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires logistics and related assets and businesses including terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistics assets related to the terminalling, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil and refined products. WNRL's assets and operations include   692   miles of pipelines,   12.4 million   barrels ("bbls") of active storage capacity, distribution of wholesale petroleum products and crude oil and asphalt trucking. 
  On   September 15, 2016  ,   we acquired certain terminalling, transportation and storage assets from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western consisting of the Cottage Grove tank farm and certain terminals and storage assets located on site at Western's St. Paul Park refinery ("St. Paul Park Logistics Assets"). The St. Paul Park Logistics Assets primarily receive, store and distribute crude oil, feedstock and refined products associated with Western's St. Paul Park refinery   (the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  ").   We acquired the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets from Western in exchange for     $195 million   in cash and   628,224   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. We refer to this transaction as the "  St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction  ." This transaction was between entities under common control. See   Note 3, Acquisitions of Common Control Assets  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
  On   September 7, 2016  ,   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of     7,500,000     common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. 
  On May 16, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of   3,750,000   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to   562,500   additional common units on the same terms, which was exercised in full and closed on June 1, 2016.  
  On October 30, 2015, WNRL acquired a segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system from Western that extends from our crude oil station in Star Lake, New Mexico, in the Four Corners region to our T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the "TexNew Mex Pipeline System"). We also acquired an   80,000   barrel crude oil storage tank located at our crude oil pumping station in Star Lake, New Mexico and certain other related assets ("TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition"). We acquired these assets in exchange for   $170 million   in cash,   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   units of a newly created class of limited partner interests in WNRL, referred to as the "TexNew Mex Units." This purchase was between entities under common control. See   Note 3, Acquisitions of Common Control Assets  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  
  We recorded the purchase of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System assets at Western's historical book value. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") require that we treat these purchases as transactions between entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information for WNRL, to include the historical results of the assets acquired, for periods prior to the effective date of the transactions.

Major Influences on Results of Operations 
  Supply and Demand for Crude Oil and Refined Products.   We generate a significant portion of our revenues under fee-based agreements with Western. These contracts generally provide for stable and predictable cash flows and limit our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations related to the loss allowance provisions in our commercial agreements. We typically do not have exposure to variability in the prices of the hydrocarbons and other products we handle on Western's behalf, although these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term because of their impact on Western's operations. Our terminal throughput volumes depend primarily on the volume of refined and other products produced at Western s refineries that, in turn, is ultimately dependent on Western s refining margins.  
  Refining margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.  
  A significant portion of our wholesale fuel sales and all of our lubricants sales are to third-party customers. We purchase substantially all of our fuel from Western on the same day that we sell it, which minimizes our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The margins we earn on these sales are dependent on a number of factors that are outside of our control, including the overall supply of refined products and lubricants in the regions that we serve as well as the demand for these products by our customers. Among other factors, the margins we earn through these activities would likely be adversely impacted in the event of excess supply of refined products or lubricants and corresponding customer demand that is below historical norms. These supply and demand dynamics are subject to day-to-day variability and may result in volatility in the margins that our wholesale business achieves. Extended periods of market conditions that result in earning margins that are lower than anticipated could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
  Acquisition Opportunities.   We may acquire additional logistics assets from Western or third parties. Under our omnibus agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we have rights of first offer on certain logistics assets owned by Western to the extent Western decides to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of those assets. We also have rights of first offer to acquire additional logistics assets in the Permian Basin or the Four Corners area that Western may construct or acquire in the future. We plan to pursue strategic asset acquisitions from third parties to the extent such acquisitions complement our or Western s existing asset base or provide attractive potential returns in new areas within our geographic footprint. We believe that we are well-positioned to acquire logistics assets from Western and third parties should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash available for distribution. These acquisitions could also affect the comparability of our results from period to period. We expect to fund future growth capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash-on-hand, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. To the extent we issue additional units to fund future acquisitions or discretionary capital expenditures, the payments of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. 
   
  Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results  
  On   September 7, 2016  ,   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of     7,500,000     common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units. 
  On May 16, 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of   3,750,000   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase up to   562,500   additional common units on the same terms, which was exercised in full and closed on June 1, 2016.  
  We did not record revenue related to the operations of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   prior to the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   on September 15, 2016. Revenues generated and reported by the TexNew Mex Pipeline System, prior to the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition on October 30, 2015, were minimal and were for amounts required to be recorded for Western for regulatory reporting. We did not record intercompany revenues related to the operation of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System and related assets for the benefit of Western prior to the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition. 
  The financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retrospectively adjusted to include the combined financial results of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   prior to   September 15, 2016   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System prior to October 30, 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In order to apply these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based on the continuing development of the information utilized and subsequent events, some of which we may have little or no control over. Our critical accounting policies could materially affect the amounts recorded in our financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates and recent accounting pronouncements that potentially impact us are discussed in detail under   Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.   From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related reporting and disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on recent accounting pronouncements, see     Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. 
   
  How We Evaluate Our Operations  
  Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include but are not limited to pipeline throughput and terminal volumes; wholesale volumes and margins; operating and maintenance expenses; EBITDA and distributable cash flow.  
  Logistics Volumes.   The amount of revenue we generate depends on the volumes of crude oil and refined and other products that we handle with our pipeline and gathering operations and our terminalling, transportation and storage assets. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and asphalt in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Although Western has committed to minimum volumes under our commercial agreements, we expect over time that Western will ship volumes in excess of its minimum volume commitment on our pipeline and gathering systems and will terminal volumes in excess of its minimum volume commitments at our terminals. Our results of operations will be impacted by whether or not Western ships and terminals such incremental volumes and by the amount of volumes we handle for third parties.  
  Wholesale Volumes and Margins.   Revenues, earnings and cash flows from our wholesale business are primarily affected by sales volumes and margins for gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricants sold and crude oil and asphalt trucking volumes. We primarily use fuel margin per gallon and fuel gallons sold to evaluate the operating results of the wholesale segment. Our fuel margin per gallon is not generally correlated with changes in absolute price per gallon. Sales volumes of gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricants are affected primarily by demand and competition. Crude oil trucking volumes can fluctuate based on local production, competition and demand. Refined product margins are equal to the sales price, net of discounts, less total cost of sales and are measured on a cents per gallon basis. Factors that influence margins include local supply, demand and competition, and the impact to margin of our commercial agreements with Western. 
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.   Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses primarily consist of labor and employee expenses, lease costs, utility costs, cost of insurance, maintenance materials, supplies, repairs and related expenses and property taxes. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of maintenance related activities performed during that period and the timing of such expenses.  
  Our maintenance costs are generally cyclical in nature. Our terminal facilities are subject to recurring maintenance for normal wear and related maintenance costs are generally consistent from period to period. Our routine service cycle for tank inspections and maintenance at our storage facilities is generally every 10 years. Our pipelines are also subject to routine periodic inspections and maintenance. When a storage tank change in service occurs, maintenance costs will generally be greater due to increased costs of tank cleaning and hazardous material disposal. The cost of our maintenance is dependent upon the level of repairs deemed necessary as a result of the inspection of the specific asset. We manage our maintenance expenditures on our pipelines, terminals, truck fleet and other distribution assets by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability and minimize impact on our cash flows.  
   
  Results of Operations 
  The following tables summarize our consolidated and operating segment financial data and key operating statistics for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The following data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.

The assets acquired in the   St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction   and the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition are reflected at Western's historical book value as the purchases were transactions between entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information for WNRL to include the historical results of the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and the   TexNew Mex Pipeline System   acquired for periods prior to the effective date of the acquisitions.  
  Our operations are organized into two operating segments based on marketing criteria and the nature of our products and services and our types of customers. These segments are logistics and wholesale. See   Note 4, Segment Information  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

    EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful in evaluating performance as a general indication of, among other things, our operating performance and the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to make distributions to our unitholders. We present an explanation and reconciliation to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the section titled EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow herein.    
       
  Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as total revenues, net of excise taxes, less cost of products sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as follows:  

Gross margin   decreased   by   $5.4 million   primarily due to   decreased   fee based revenues of   $4.3 million  . Fee based revenue decreased due to lower mainline movement volumes compared to 2015 and reduced crude oil trucking revenue of   $4.2 million  , in addition, lubricant margins decreased   $1.2 million  . Wholesale fuel sales revenue decreased due to overall pricing declines. The average price per gallon sold in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.58  , compared to   $1.90   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Partially offsetting the margin decrease was new activity in 2016 that includes   $1.9 million   in fees generated by our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and   $2.1 million   in asphalt trucking fees, in addition, wholesale fuel margins increased   $0.6 million  .  
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.   Operating and maintenance expenses   decreased   primarily due to lower maintenance (  $1.1 million  ), employee expenses (  $0.4 million  ), chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process  (  $0.4 million  ), outside support services (  $0.4 million  ), insurance expense (  $0.3 million  ) and lower fuel expense for our transportation department (  $0.2 million  ). Offsetting these decreases were increased operating expenses for our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   period over period (  $0.4 million  ). 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   primarily due to greater expense allocations (  $0.4 million  ) and professional and legal services related to acquisitions (  $0.3 million  ). 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased due to the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems and a change in the useful life pertaining to certain of our transportation assets.

    EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful in evaluating performance as a general indication of, among other things, our operating performance and the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to make distributions to our unitholders. We present an explanation and reconciliation to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the section titled EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow herein.    
       
  Gross Margin.   Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as total revenues, net of excise taxes, less cost of products sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as follows: 

Gross margin   increased   by   $3.8 million   primarily due to   increased   fee based revenue of   $8.7 million  . Fee based revenues increased due to higher mainline volume movements compared to 2015. New activity in 2016 includes   $1.9 million   in fees generated by our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   and   $5.8 million   in asphalt trucking fees. Partially offsetting the margin increase were decreased wholesale fuel margins of   $2.6 million  , reduced crude oil trucking revenue of   $7.5 million   and a   $3.0 million   decrease in lubricant margins. Wholesale fuel sales revenue decreased due to overall pricing declines. The average price per gallon sold in the   first nine months   of   2016  , was   $1.47   compared to   $1.90   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . 
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.   Operating and maintenance expenses were relatively flat, but included decreases to  maintenance (  $2.7 million  ), lower fuel expense for our transportation department (  $1.2 million  ) and chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process (  $1.1 million  ), partially offset by higher outside support services (  $1.7 million  ) due to in-line inspections for pipeline segments and various tank repairs, higher employee expenses (  $1.5 million  ) resulting from an increase in the number of drivers in our truck fleet, increased environmental expenses (  $0.5 million  ) and increased operating expenses for our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   period over period (  $0.8 million  ). 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   primarily due to   decreased   professional and legal services (  $0.5 million  ) related to acquisitions and other taxes (  $0.3 million  ), partially offset by increased public company costs (  $0.2 million  ). 
  Gain on disposal of assets, net  . The increase in gain on disposal of assets, net was primarily due to the sale of assets related to our lubricant sales activities in California during the current period. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased due to the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition, the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems and a change in the useful life pertaining to certain of our transportation assets.

Interest and Debt Expense.   The increase in interest expense from prior periods was attributable to interest incurred through our issuance of   $300.0 million   of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes during the first quarter of 2015 and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility during the current period. 
   
  EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow 
  We define EBITDA as earnings before interest and debt expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Distributable Cash Flow as EBITDA plus the change in deferred revenues, less interest accruals, income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures and distributions declared on our TexNew Mex units. The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to EBITDA is net income. The GAAP liquidity measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities.      
  EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:    
             
    EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;    
                
    EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;    
                
    EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and    
                
    EBITDA, as we calculate it, may differ from the EBITDA calculations of our affiliates or other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.    
     EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:     
             
    our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financial methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;     
                
    the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to make distributions to our unitholders;     
                
    our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and     
                
    the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.     
     Distributable Cash Flow is a standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield. Yield is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Although distributable cash flow is a liquidity measure, it is presented in this reconciliation to net income as supplemental information.     
  We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to limited partners. These non-GAAP measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.     
  The calculation of EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow includes the results of operations for the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets subsequent to the St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   The results of operations for the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets and the TexNew Mex Pipeline System are excluded from the EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow calculations for the comparable periods in the prior year because a retrospective adjustment of these performance measures is not a representative measure of performance results.

    Some barrels of crude oil in route to Western's Gallup refinery and Permian/Delaware Basin are transported on more than one of our mainlines. Mainline movements for the Four Corners and Delaware Basin systems include each barrel transported on each mainline. During the second quarter of 2015, we began shipping crude oil from the Four Corners system, through the TexNew Mex Pipeline System, to the Permian/Delaware system. 
              (2) 
    Storage shell capacities represent weighted-average capacities for the periods indicated.     
     Fee Based Revenues.      We generate our logistics revenues from third-party contracts and commercial agreements with Western. On July 1, 2016, we decreased certain pipeline, terminal and other service fee rates with such decreases averaging   3.0%   for terminal, storage and gathering activities and   2.0%   for crude oil pipeline shipments based on negative changes in the Producer Price Index stipulated in our commercial agreements with Western. These decreases collectively accounted for a   $0.9 million   decrease in fee based revenues period over period.  
  Our Permian Basin assets decreased overall volumes by   7,036   barrels per day, or "bpd", compared to 2015, resulting in decreased fees of   $0.6 million  . Our Four Corners system volumes were down by   13,532   bpd. Current period volumes included

movements on newly constructed, higher capacity pipelines that receive higher regulatory tariffs than did comparable pipeline deliveries in   2015  . These redirected volumes resulted in a   $0.2 million   decrease in Four Corners fees period over period. Our TexNew Mex Pipeline System volumes were down   7,330   bpd compared to 2015, resulting in decreased fees of   $2.6 million  . In addition, terminalling fees and additive revenue of   $1.5 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, decreased period over period. Offsetting these decreases, pipeline storage fees increased   $0.5 million   period over period and our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  , acquired   September 15, 2016  , generated   $1.9 million   in additional fee based revenue during the   third   quarter of   2016  .  
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.     Operating and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to maintenance expense (  $0.9 million  ), chemical expense (  $0.4 million  ) specifically related to chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process and outside support services (  $0.4 million  ) partially offset by increased employee expenses (  $0.5 million  ) and increased operating expenses for our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   period over period (  $0.4 million  ). 
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased indirect charges allocated from Western (  $0.3 million  ). 
  Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization increased due to the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

Despite decreased rates, our fee based revenues increased by   $1.1 million   period over period based on several contributing factors throughout our operating regions. 
  Our Permian Basin assets increased overall volumes by   5,925   bpd compared to   2015  , resulting in increased fees of   $1.5 million  . Our Four Corners system volumes were down slightly, by   196   bpd, but current period volumes included movements on newly constructed, higher capacity pipelines that receive higher regulatory tariffs than did comparable pipeline deliveries in

2015  . These redirected volumes resulted in a   $1.8 million   increase in Four Corners fees period over period. Our TexNew Mex Pipeline System, which commenced operations in April 2015, generated a full   nine   months of   2016   fees, resulting in a   $5.5 million   increase. Our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   that we acquired on   September 15, 2016  , generated   $1.9 million   in new fee based revenue during the   third   quarter of   2016  . Prior to acquiring the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  , they did not generate revenue. Offsetting these increases were decreased terminalling fees and additive revenue of   $2.8 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, period over period. 
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.     Operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased employee expenses (  $2.0 million  ), outside support services (  $1.8 million  ) due to in-line inspections of certain pipeline segments and various tank repairs, environmental expenses (  $0.5 million  ) and operating expenses for our   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   (  $0.8 million  ). Offsetting these increases was decreased maintenance expense (  $2.3 million  ).  
  General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreased other taxes (  $0.3 million  ) offset by increased indirect charges allocated from Western (  $0.1 million  ). 
  Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization increased due to assets capitalized in the TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition and the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

    All wholesale fee based revenues are generated through fees charged to Western's refining segment for truck transportation and delivery of crude oil and asphalt. Affiliate and third-party sales based revenues result from sales of refined products to Western and third-party customers at a delivered price that includes charges for product transportation.     
              (2) 
    Fuel margin per gallon is a measurement calculated by dividing the difference between fuel sales, net of transportation charges, and cost of fuel sales for our wholesale business by the number of gallons sold. Fuel margin per gallon is a measure frequently used in the petroleum products wholesale industry to measure operating results related to fuel sales. 
              (3) 
    Lubricant margin per gallon is a measurement calculated by dividing the difference between lubricant sales, net of transportation charges, and lubricant cost of products sold by the number of gallons sold. Lubricant margin is a measure frequently used in the petroleum products wholesale industry to measure operating results related to lubricant sales.    
     Gross Margin.     Gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as total revenues, net of excise taxes, less cost of products sold, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as follows: 

We primarily use fuel margin per gallon and fuel gallons sold to evaluate the operating results of the wholesale segment. We believe this metric is more useful to investors than utilizing the absolute price per gallon and cost of product sold since fuel prices can be volatile and our fuel margin per gallon is not generally correlated with changes in absolute prices per gallon. Wholesale gross margin decreased   $1.1 million   quarter over quarter. Decreased revenue of   $4.2 million   from crude oil gathering activity by truck and a   $1.2 million   decrease in margin from lubricant sales contributed to the decreased gross margin, partially offset by increased revenue of   $2.1 million   period over period from new asphalt hauling activity by truck. Fuel margins increased   $0.6 million   primarily due to a per gallon increase in fuel margins of approximately   $0.001   and a   8.0 million   gallon increase in total fuel sales.  
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.     The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses was the result of lower employee expenses (  $0.9 million  ), fuel expense for our truck fleet (  $0.2 million  ), maintenance expense (  $0.2 million  ) and insurance expense (  $0.2 million  ). 
  Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization increased due to a change in the useful life pertaining to certain of our transportation assets.

We primarily use fuel margin per gallon and fuel gallons sold to evaluate the operating results of the wholesale segment. We believe this metric is more useful to investors than utilizing the absolute price per gallon and cost of product sold since fuel prices can be volatile and our fuel margin per gallon is not generally correlated with changes in absolute price per gallon. Wholesale gross margin decreased   $4.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Fuel margins accounted for   $2.6 million   of this decrease primarily due to a per gallon decrease in fuel margins of approximately   $0.003  , partially offset by a   20.2 million   gallon increase in total fuel sales. Decreased revenue of   $7.5 million   associated with crude oil gathering activity by truck and a   $3.0 million   decrease in margin from lubricant sales also contributed to the decreased gross margin, partially offset by increased revenue of   $5.8 million   period over period from new asphalt hauling activity by truck. 
  Operating and Maintenance Expenses.     The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses was the result of lower fuel expense for our truck fleet (  $1.2 million  ), lower employee expense (  $0.6 million  ) and lower maintenance expense (  $0.3 million  ). 
  Gain on disposal of assets, net  . The increase in gain on disposal of assets, net was primarily due to the sale of assets related to our lubricant sales activities in California during the current period. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.     Depreciation and amortization increased due to a change in the useful life pertaining to certain of our transportation assets. 
   
  Outlook 
  We generate our operating revenues from our fee-based arrangements with Western, through sales of wholesale fuels to Western and third parties and through fees charged on crude oil and refined product transportation. Our operating results depend significantly on the volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products that we transport through our pipelines and process through our terminals and transportation operations. The reliability of Western's refineries and the supply of and demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products in the regions that we serve each bear significant influence on our results of operations.  
  Effective July 1,   2016  , our logistics segment reduced the contractual rates on fees that it charges for pipeline transportation, storage and terminalling services based on a decrease of   3.3%   in the Producer Price Index that governs the contractual rates that establish our fees. Moreover, crude oil production levels in the Four Corners region and in the Delaware Basin have experienced reduced growth rates due to lower industry average crude oil prices compared to recent historical averages. These reduced growth rates can have a corresponding impact on the growth of our overall pipeline and crude oil truck transportation volumes. These factors, both independently and on a combined basis could have an impact on our logistics segment results. 
  Our wholesale fuel margins are dependent on the contractual prices that we charge to Western and on margins that we realize from third-party customers. To date in the   fourth   quarter of   2016  , our wholesale fuel margins are improved relative to the average of   $0.030   per gallon that we realized for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $16.5 million  . Our sources for liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of equity or debt securities. 
  We purchased the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets   for   $195.0 million   and   628,224   common units. We funded the cash portion of the consideration through a combination of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and   $174.7 million   of cash on hand primarily generated from a September 2016 equity offering of   8,625,000   common units.

Table of Contents  

We funded the purchase of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System using   $170 million   in cash, including borrowings of   $145.0 million   under our Revolving Credit Facility and   $25 million   from cash on hand, the issuance of   421,031   common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and   80,000   TexNew Mex Units. We repaid the   $145.0 million   of outstanding direct borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  On   September 7, 2016  ,   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of     7,500,000     common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The closing of the offering occurred on September 13, 2016. We also granted the underwriter an option to purchase   additional common units on the same terms which was exercised in full and closed on September 30, 2016  , for   1,125,000   additional common units.  
  In May 2016, we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and sale by the Partnership of   3,750,000   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. We also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to   562,500   additional common units on the same terms, that was exercised in full and closed in early June 2016.   We used the net proceeds generated from our equity offering to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility during the period. 
  On February 11, 2015, we issued the   $300.0 million   WNRL 2023 Senior Notes and used the proceeds to repay the borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Revolving Credit Facility had availability of   $479.0 million  , net of   $20.3 million   in direct borrowings and   $0.7 million   in outstanding letters of credit. Our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our WNRL 2023 Senior Notes both contain covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make cash distributions. Under our Revolving Credit Facility, we are permitted to make cash distributions to our equity holders, including our general partner, but only up to the amount of available cash under our partnership agreement and so long as no default exists or will be caused by such distributions. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are also required to maintain certain financial ratios, each tested on a quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period. The indenture governing the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes also prohibits us from making cash distributions to our equity holders, unless no default has occurred or will be caused by such distributions and such distributions are less than the cap amount prescribed in the indenture. See   Note 10, Debt  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  We currently have an effective universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 that provides for the registration and sale of up to   $1 billion   of our or certain of our subsidiaries equity or debt securities. We may over time, and subject to market conditions, in one or more offerings, offer and sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus.   During the second and third quarter of 2016, we completed equity offerings pursuant to the shelf registration statement and resulted in reduced availability.   The current availability under our shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 is   $713.8 million  . 
  Our minimum quarterly distribution of   $0.2875     per unit per quarter, or   $1.15   per unit on an annualized basis, aggregates to   $17.5 million   per quarter and   $70.0 million   per year based on the current number of common and subordinated units outstanding. We do not have a legal obligation to pay this distribution. Any distributions are subject to compliance with the restrictions of our Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Our Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement sets forth the calculation to be used to determine the amount and priority of cash distributions that the common and subordinated unitholders, our General Partner as the holder of incentive distribution rights and Western as the holder of the TexNew Mex Units will receive. In accordance with our partnership agreement, Western's subordinated units will convert to common units once we have met specified distribution targets and successfully completed other tests set forth in our Second A R Partnership Agreement. Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we declared and paid distributions that were in excess of the target distribution amounts set forth in our partnership agreement, resulting in distributions to our General Partner as the holder of incentive distribution rights. We made cash distributions to our General Partner of   $1.2 million  ,   $2.9 million  ,   $0.3 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Refer to   Note 11, Equity  , in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding incentive distribution rights.

The table below summarizes our   2016   quarterly distribution declarations, payments and scheduled payments: 

Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

The   increase   in net cash from operating activities period over period was primarily the result of changes in our working capital as disclosed in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The change in third-party accounts receivable was due to an increase in wholesale third-party receivables. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to an increase in payables associated with accrued payroll expenses related to Western employee services. 
  Cash flows provided by operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , combined with   $277.8 million   from the issuance of common units and   $54.4 million   of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility were primarily used to pay the cash consideration of   $195.0 million   for acquiring the   St. Paul Park Logistics Assets  , repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of   $179.1 million  , fund cash distributions to Western and to public holders of our common units of   $41.1 million   and   $21.0 million  , respectively, and fund capital expenditures of   $24.6 million  . 
  For the same period in   2015  , cash flows provided by operating activities combined with   $300.0 million   from the issuance of our WNRL 2023 Senior Notes were primarily used to repay the borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of   $269.0 million  , fund capital expenditures of   $53.7 million  , fund cash distributions to Western and to public holders of our common units of   $32.8 million   and   $16.6 million  , respectively, and pay deferred financing costs of   $6.8 million  . 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our capital requirements have consisted of and are expected to continue to consist of maintenance related capital expenditures and discretionary capital expenditures. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $16.5 million  , the majority of which is intended for use in planned growth projects. Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline integrity and safety and to address environmental and other regulatory requirements. Discretionary capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets and expand existing facilities that increase throughput capacity of our pipelines and in our terminals or increase storage capacity at our storage facilities. For   2016  , we expect to spend   $10.0 million   for maintenance capital projects and up to   $20.0 million   in discretionary growth projects. We rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund any significant future discretionary capital expenditures.  
  Contractual Obligations 
  We include a complete summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of   December 31, 2015  , in our   2015   Form 10-K under   Part I, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Contractual Obligations. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Regulatory Matters  
  Our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. Our interstate common carrier crude oil pipeline is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under the Interstate Commerce Act (the  ICA ) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws.  
  The FERC regulations require, among other things, that rates for interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products and certain other liquids (collectively referred to as  petroleum pipelines ), be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. The ICA also requires interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service and apply them uniformly to all shippers. Under the ICA, the FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. If the FERC determines that a protested rate is unjust and unreasonable, the FERC may order refunds of amounts charged in excess of the just and reasonable rate. The FERC may also order a pipeline to change its rates, and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 
  We operate certain segments of our pipeline system pursuant to tariffs filed with the FERC. The FERC or a state commission could investigate our rates on its own initiative or at the urging of a third party. If our rate levels are investigated by the FERC or a state commission, the inquiry could result in a comparison of our rates to those charged by others or to an investigation of our costs. For several segments of our pipeline system, the FERC has granted us a temporary waiver of the filing and reporting requirements. These segments are still subject to the FERC s jurisdiction under the ICA and we are still subject to the other requirements of the ICA. If the facts upon which the waiver was granted change materially (for example, if an unaffiliated third party seeks access to our pipelines), we are required to inform the FERC, which may result in revocation of the waiver.  
  We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) through safety standards and regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ), the Texas Railroad Commission, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, as well as various federal and state environmental agencies. These regulations include, but are not limited to, regulations regarding pipeline design, construction, operation, maintenance, integrity, testing, spill prevention and spill response plans. Many of these regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. 
  Environmental and Other Matters  
  Environmental Regulation  . Our operations are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of contamination and protection of endangered and threatened species. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to develop, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory authorities and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the development of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage, or by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts.  
  Environmental Liabilities  . Western has been party to various litigation and contingent loss matters, including environmental matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of these matters. Our historical costs have not been material. We are not currently aware of any environmental or other asserted or unasserted claims against us or that involve our assets that would be expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Western has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental cleanup expenses.

Seasonality  
  The crude oil, refined product and asphalt throughput in our pipelines and terminals and crude oil trucking volume are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and asphalt in the regions that we serve either directly or indirectly. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues will be substantially mitigated through our fee based commercial agreements with Western that include minimum monthly volume commitments. 
   
  Item 3.  Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
  Refer to   Part II, Item 7A   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. There have been no material changes in our exposures to market risk since   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           Item 4.   
    Controls and Procedures 
     Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  In the ordinary conduct of our business, we are subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims, including environmental claims and employee related matters. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against us, we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceedings or proceedings to which we are a party will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from those previously disclosed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our   2015   Form 10-K under   Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
  We may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets, or in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of the St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction. 
  The acquisition component of our growth strategy depends on the successful integration of acquisitions such as the St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction. We face numerous risks and challenges to successful integration of the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets, including: 
             
    the potential for unexpected costs, delays and challenges that may arise in integrating the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets into our existing business; 
                
    environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liabilities or accidents; 
                
    the temporary diversion of management s attention from our existing businesses; 
                
    our inability or limited ability to control the operations and management of the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets; and 
                
    the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities and costs for which indemnification is unavailable or inadequate. 
     If we are unable to successfully integrate the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets due to any of these factors, our future business, operations and distributable cash flow could be adversely impacted.
