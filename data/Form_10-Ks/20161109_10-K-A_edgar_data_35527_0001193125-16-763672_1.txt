   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
 The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp s management,
including the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management on a timely basis. Based on the evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorp s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorp s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of deficiencies in the Bancorp s policies and procedures relating to the registration of, and prospectus delivery with
respect to, the Bancorp s employee benefit plans as described in Part II, Item 5 (Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities).

      MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING     The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The Bancorp s management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Management s assessment is based on the criteria established in the  Internal
Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2015. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. The Bancorp s independent registered public accounting
firm, that audited the Bancorp s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. This report appears on page 83 of the annual
report.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the
 Bancorp ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorp s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment as to the
Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorp s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.    A
company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

SECURITIES     The Bancorp s common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and is listed under the symbol  FITB 
on the NASDAQ  Global Select Market System.      
   See a discussion of dividend limitations that the subsidiaries can pay to the Bancorp discussed in Note 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp had 44,678 shareholders of record.      

(a)  
    The Bancorp repurchased 78,967, 53,701 and 37,869 shares during October, November and December of 2015,
respectively, in connection with various employee compensation plans of the Bancorp. These purchases do not count against the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the Board of Directors  authorization.    

(b)  
    In March of 2014, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase
100 million shares of the Bancorp s common stock through the open market or in any private party transactions. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date.    
       See further discussion on accelerated share repurchase transactions and stock-based compensation in Note 23 and Note
24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      180  Fifth Third Bancorp

181  Fifth Third Bancorp    

Table of Contents  

   Shares Issued Under Certain Employee Benefit Plans   
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp determined that a number of shares of Fifth Third Bancorp common stock offered under our 401(k)
Plan were previously inadvertently omitted from inclusion on the corresponding S-8 registration statements, that a number of securities granted under Fifth Third s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) and incentive compensation plans
were granted without appropriate prospectus delivery, and that deferred compensation obligations owed in respect of the Fifth Third Bancorp Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan may have been required to be registered. As a result, the Bancorp
estimates that (i) approximately 1,655,905 unregistered shares were sold through the 401(k) Plan during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015; (ii) approximately 558,184 shares were purchased through the ESPP during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015; (iii) approximately 4,558,866 restricted shares and 5,208,540 stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) were awarded under our incentive compensation plans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015; (iv) approximately
125,762 options and 3,242,263 SARs were exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, at a weighted average option exercise price (or, in the case of SARs, mean grant date price per share) of $13.59; and (v) approximately $7,581,936 in
aggregate deferrals were made under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.    The
Bancorp expects to file the required Forms S-8 and make a voluntary rescission offer to eligible plan participants during the fourth quarter of 2016 in order to remediate the registration and prospectus delivery defects. The Bancorp has also
corrected the prospectus delivery defect in the intervening period subsequent to the third quarter of 2016. Based on the market price of Fifth Third Bancorp s common stock in October 2016, the Bancorp does not expect that the exercise of any
applicable rescission rights will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.      181a Fifth Third Bancorp
