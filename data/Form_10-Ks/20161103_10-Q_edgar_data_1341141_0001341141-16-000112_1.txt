CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of   CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc.   and subsidiaries (   CatchMark Timber Trust  ,   we,   our,  or  us ) may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). In addition,   CatchMark Timber Trust  , or the executive officers on   CatchMark Timber Trust   s behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents   CatchMark Timber Trust   files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors, or others. We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, and prospects and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. 
    
  Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,  or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date that this report is filed with the SEC. We make no representations or warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
    
  Any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, make distributions to stockholders, and maintain the value of our timberland properties, may be significantly hindered. See Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of some, although not all, of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements.

1. 
    Organization 
       
  CatchMark Timber Trust   Inc. ("CatchMark Timber Trust") (  NYSE  : CTT) primarily engages in the ownership, management, acquisition, and disposition of timberlands located in the U.S. South and has elected to be taxed as a   REIT   for federal income tax purposes.   CatchMark Timber Trust   was incorporated in Maryland in 2005 and commenced operations in 2007.   CatchMark Timber Trust   conducts substantially all of its business through CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (   CatchMark Timber OP   ), a Delaware limited partnership.   CatchMark Timber Trust   is the general partner of   CatchMark Timber OP  , possesses full legal control and authority over its operations, and owns   99.99%   of its common partnership units. CatchMark LP Holder, LLC (   CatchMark LP Holder   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of   CatchMark Timber Trust  , is the sole limited partner of   CatchMark Timber OP  . In addition, CatchMark Timber TRS, Inc. ( CatchMark TRS ), a Delaware corporation, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of   CatchMark Timber OP   in 2006. Unless otherwise noted, references herein to   CatchMark Timber Trust   shall include   CatchMark Timber Trust   and all of its subsidiaries, including   CatchMark Timber OP  , and the subsidiaries of   CatchMark Timber OP  , including CatchMark TRS. 
    
  CatchMark Timber Trust generates recurring income and cash flow from the harvest and sale of timber, as well as from non-timber related revenue sources, such as recreational leases.   CatchMark Timber Trust   also periodically generates income and cash flow from the sale of non-strategic timberland properties, or HBU timberland properties that have a higher-value use beyond growing timber, such as properties that can be sold for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes at prices in excess of traditional timberland values.   CatchMark Timber Trust   expects to realize additional long-term returns from the potential appreciation in value of its timberlands as well as from the biological growth of its standing timber inventory in excess of its timber harvest.  

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements of CatchMark Timber Trust have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements for these unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods. Results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. CatchMark Timber Trust s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of any entity in which CatchMark Timber Trust or its subsidiaries owns a controlling financial interest and any limited partnership in which CatchMark Timber Trust or its subsidiaries owns a controlling general partnership interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In February 2016, the   FASB   issued   ASU   No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)   . The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees classified as capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain

practical expedients available. CatchMark Timber Trust has not yet adopted the new standard and is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   .

For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. CatchMark Timber Trust has not yet adopted the new standard and is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its financial statements.

The 2014 Amended Credit Facilities may be increased, upon the agreement of lenders willing to increase their loans, by an additional   $110.0 million  .  

12 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , CatchMark Timber Trust's amounts outstanding under the 2014 Amended Credit Facilities consisted of the following:

                (3)   
    Represents the weighted average interest rate as of   September 30, 2016  . The weighted average interest rate excludes the impact of the interest rate swaps (see   Note 5   Interest Rate Swaps  ), amortization of deferred financing costs, unused commitment fees, and estimated patronage refunds.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $200.9 million   remained available under the 2014 Amended Credit Facilities,   $165.9 million   from the 2014 Multi-Draw Term Facility and   $35.0 million   from the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  Patronage 
    
  As a result of entering into the 2014 Amended Credit Agreement, CatchMark Timber Trust became eligible to receive annual patronage refunds from its lenders (the "Patronage Banks"), a profit-sharing program made available to borrowers of the Farm Credit System lenders. CatchMark Timber Trust has received a patronage refund on its eligible patronage loans for 2014 and 2015 and accrues for the expected refunds for 2016 by multiplying the weighted average eligible outstanding balance by   0.90%  . For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, CatchMark Timber Trust recorded   $0.7 million   and   $0.3 million   in expected patronage refunds. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, CatchMark Timber Trust recorded   $1.6 million   and   $0.9 million   in expected patronage refunds. 
    
  Debt Covenants

In addition, CatchMark Timber Trust is permitted to declare and pay dividends, distributions, and other payments to its stockholders as required to maintain its REIT qualification so long as certain events of default have not occurred. Further, the 2014 Amended Credit Agreement subjects CatchMark Timber Trust to mandatory prepayment from proceeds generated from dispositions of timberlands. However, provided that no event of default has occurred and the LTV ratio does not exceed   40%  , CatchMark Timber Trust is not required to repay the loans until (1) the aggregate net real property disposition proceeds received during any fiscal year exceeds   2%   of the bank value of the timberlands and (2) lease termination proceeds of greater than   0.5%   and   1.5%   of the bank value of the timberlands in a single termination or in aggregate over the term of the facility, respectively. 
    
  The 2014 Amended Credit Agreement contains, among others, the following financial covenants:  
               
    limits the LTV Ratio to   45%   at the end of each fiscal quarter and upon the sale or acquisition of any property;  
                 
    requires maintenance of a minimum liquidity balance of no less than   $20.0 million   at any time. 
       
  CatchMark Timber Trust   was in compliance with the financial covenants of the 2014 Amended Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  .

Included in the interest payments for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were unused commitment fees of   $0.5 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings, after consideration of interest rate swaps, was   2.94%   and   2.65%  , respectively. After further consideration of the expected patronage refunds,   CatchMark Timber Trust  's weighted average interest rate as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was   2.04%   and   1.75%  , respectively.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of CatchMark Timber Trust's outstanding debt approximated its book value. The fair value was estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using the current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the measurement dates. 

5.     Interest Rate Swaps 
  CatchMark Timber Trust uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its exposure to changing interest rates on its variable rate debt instruments. On August 11, 2016, CatchMark Timber Trust entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Rabobank on   $45.0 million   of the 2014 Term Loan Facility that is subject to a variable interest rate (the "2016 Rabobank Swap"). The 2016 Rabobank Swap qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. CatchMark Timber Trust had two interest rate swaps outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   which effectively fixed interest rates on   $80.0 million   of its 2014 Term Loan Facility, with terms below:

     Table of Contents  

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   CatchMark Timber Trust   recognized a change in fair value of the interest rate swaps of approximately   $2.2 million   as other comprehensive loss. There was   no   hedge ineffectiveness on the interest rate swaps required to be recognized in current earnings. Net payments of approximately   $0.5 million   made under the interest rate swaps by   CatchMark Timber Trust   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were recorded as interest expense.  

6.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Mahrt Timber Agreements 
    
  CatchMark Timber Trust   is party to a fiber supply agreement and a master stumpage agreement (collectively, the  Mahrt Timber Agreements ) with a wholly owned subsidiary of   WestRock  . The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber. The fiber supply agreement is subject to quarterly market pricing adjustments based on an index published by Timber Mart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in   11   southern states. The master stumpage agreement provides that   CatchMark Timber Trust   will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of its timberlands to CatchMark TRS for harvesting. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is   October 9, 2007   through   December 31, 2032  , subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term source of supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide   CatchMark Timber Trust   with a reliable customer for the wood products from its timberlands.  
    
  Timberland Operating Agreement 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the timberland operating agreement between CatchMark Timber Trust and   FRC   (the "FRC Timberland Operating Agreement"), FRC manages and operates a majority of   CatchMark Timber Trust  's timberlands and related timber operations, including ensuring delivery of timber to WestRock in compliance with the Mahrt Timber Agreements. In consideration for rendering the services described in the timberland operating agreement,   CatchMark Timber Trust   pays FRC (i) a monthly management fee based on the actual acreage FRC manages, which is payable monthly in advance, and (ii) an incentive fee based on timber harvest revenues generated by the timberlands, which is payable quarterly in arrears. The timberland operating agreement, as amended, is effective through   March 31, 2017  , with the option to extend for   one  -year periods and may be terminated by either party with mutual consent or by   CatchMark Timber Trust   with or without cause upon providing   120   days  prior written notice.  
    
  Litigation 
    
  From time to time,   CatchMark Timber Trust   may be a party to legal proceedings, claims, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any reasonably possible loss relating to these matters using the latest information available.   CatchMark Timber Trust   records a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range,   CatchMark Timber Trust   accrues the best estimate within the range. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount,   CatchMark Timber Trust   accrues the minimum amount within the range. If an unfavorable outcome is probable but the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated,   CatchMark Timber Trust   discloses the nature of the litigation and indicates that an estimate of the loss or range of loss cannot be made. If an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the estimated loss is material,   CatchMark Timber Trust   discloses the  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

nature and estimate of the possible loss of the litigation.   CatchMark Timber Trust   does not disclose information with respect to litigation where an unfavorable outcome is considered to be remote.  
    
  CatchMark Timber Trust   is not currently involved in any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of   CatchMark Timber Trust  .    CatchMark Timber Trust   is not aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities.  

7.    Stock-based Compensation 
    
  Long-term Incentive Plan 
    
  CatchMark Timber Trust's LTIP allows for the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, and deferred stock units of its common stock to the employees and independent directors. The LTIP provides for issuance of up to   1.3 million   shares of CTT common stock through October 25, 2023. 
    
  Effective October 1, 2015, under the Amended and Restated Independent Directors' Compensation Plan (a sub-plan of the LTIP), each of the independent directors receives, on the first business day immediately prior to the date on which CatchMark Timber Trust holds its annual stockholders meeting, a number of shares of CatchMark Timber Trust common stock having a value of $  50,000   on the grant date. The number of shares granted to each independent director will be determined by dividing $  50,000   by the fair market value per share of CatchMark Timber Trust's common stock on the grant date. The shares are fully-vested and non-forfeitable upon the respective grant date. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , CatchMark Timber Trust issued   20,440   shares to its independent directors. 
    
  Restricted Stock Grants 
    
  CatchMark Timber Trust has issued service-based and performance-based restricted stock to its employees and independent directors pursuant to its LTIP. Service-based restricted stock grants vest ratably over a multi-year period. Performance-based restricted stock is granted to the executive officers and restricted shares may be earned based on the level of achievement of certain pre-determined performance goals over the performance period. Earned awards are determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors after the end of the performance period and vest over a period specific to each performance grant.  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , CatchMark Timber Trust granted   125,123   shares of service-based restricted stock to its employees that vest over a   four  -year period. 
    
  A rollforward of CatchMark Timber Trust's unvested restricted stock award activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
    
  On May 5, 2016, CatchMark Timber Trust issued   80,366   RSUs to its executive officers (the "2016 Performance Awards"), with a weighted average grant date per-unit fair value of   $14.28  . A RSU gives the holder thereof the right, subject to certain restrictions and risk of forfeiture, to receive shares of common stock of CatchMark Timber Trust in  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

the future. The number of RSUs earned is determined based on CatchMark Timber Trust's   TSR   as compared to a pre-established peer group's TSR and to the Russell 3000 Index over the performance period.   50%   of any RSUs awarded vest on the date it is determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors and the remaining   50%   vest on the one year anniversary of the determination date.  
    
  The fair value of the 2016 Performance Awards was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation with the following assumptions: 

Stock-based Compensation Expense 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, CatchMark Timber Trust recognized approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, CatchMark Timber Trust recognized approximately   $1.3 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $3.6 million   of unrecognized compensation expenses related to non-vested restricted stock and RSU's remained and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of   3.3 years  . 

8.    Subsequent Event 
    
  Dividend declaration 
    
  On November 3, 2016, CatchMark Timber Trust declared a cash dividend of   $0.135   per share for its Class A common stockholders of record on November 30, 2016, payable on December 16, 2016.           
   
           ITEM 2.   
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. See also  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  preceding Part I, as well as our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Overview 
    
  We primarily engage in the ownership, management, acquisition, and disposition of timberland properties located in the U.S. South. We generate recurring income and cash flow from the harvest and sale of timber, as well as from non-timber related revenue sources, such as recreational leases. We also periodically generate income and cash flow from the sale of HBU timberland and non-strategic timberland. We expect to realize additional long-term returns from the potential appreciation in value of our timberlands as well as from the biological growth of our standing timber inventory in excess of our timber harvest.  

17 

     Table of Contents  

The focus of our business is to invest in timberlands and to actively manage our assets to provide current income and attractive long-term returns to our stockholders. Our immediate emphasis is to grow through accretive acquisitions. We continue to build our pipeline of potential acquisitions focused in the U.S. South, where we see the best value opportunities. 
    
  On June 15, 2016, we completed our largest timberland transaction (the "Carolinas Midlands III transaction") since our listing on the NYSE, acquiring approximately 51,700 acres in South Carolina for   $101.4 million  , including closing costs. The Carolinas Midlands III transaction adds approximately 2.0 million tons to our merchantable inventory, comprised of 70% pine plantations by acreage and 49% sawtimber by tons. The property is expected to add between 250,000 to 300,000 tons (4.8 to 5.8 tons per acre) to our annual harvest over the next decade. The Carolinas Midlands III transaction was funded with proceeds from our 2014 Multi-Draw Term Facility. We also assumed 96 recreational leases which cover approximately 51,600 acres and provide approximately $0.5 million in revenue annually. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   we acquired a total of approximately 60,400 acres of timberland within the markets of Coastal Georgia and the Carolinas, for a total of   $114.0   million, including closing costs. These acquisitions added approximately   2.3 million   of merchantable inventory, comprised of 68% pine plantations by acreage and 46% sawtimber by tons. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in approximately   479,100   acres of high quality industrial timberlands that have been intensively managed for sustainable commercial timber production, consisting of 74% pine stands and 26% hardwood stands. Our timberlands are within an attractive and competitive fiber basket encompassing a diverse group of pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our timber inventory consisted of an estimated   17.4   million tons of merchantable inventory with the following components: 

(1)   
    Merchantable timber inventory does not include current year growth, which should approximate current year harvest volumes (see   Results of Operations   below for information on current year harvest volume). 
               (2)   
    Includes chip-n-saw and sawtimber.  
       
  A substantial portion of our timber sales is derived from the Mahrt Timber Agreements under which we sell specified amounts of timber to WestRock subject to market pricing adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, WestRock is required to purchase approximately 441,000 tons of timber under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. For the three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , WestRock purchased approximately 138,000 and 357,000 tons, respectively, under the Mahrt Timber Agreements which represented approximately 21% and 17% of our net timber sales revenue, respectively. WestRock has historically purchased tonnage that exceeded the minimum requirement  under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. See   Note 6   Commitments and Contingencies   of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the material terms of the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
    
  In connection with the Carolinas Midlands III transaction, we assumed a pulpwood supply agreement (the "Carolinas Midlands III Supply Agreement") which requires us to harvest and sell agreed-upon pulpwood volumes to a third-party mill which they are required to purchase at defined market prices. Through its expiration on November 3, 2026, the Carolinas Midlands III Supply Agreement is expected to add between 50,000 to 100,000 tons to our annual harvest. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we are required to sell approximately 72,000 tons of pulpwood under the Carolinas Midlands III Supply Agreement. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have sold approximately 34,000 and 38,000 tons, respectively, under the Carolinas Midlands III Supply Agreement which represented 6% and 2% of our net timber revenue, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Cash flows generated from our operations are primarily used to fund recurring expenditures and distributions to our stockholders. The amount of distributions to common stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors, including funds deemed available for distribution based principally on our current and future projected operating cash flows, reduced by capital requirements necessary to maintain and grow our existing timberland portfolio. In determining the amount of distributions to common stockholders, we also consider our financial condition, our expectations of future sources of liquidity, current and future economic conditions, market demand for timber and timberlands, and tax conditions, including the annual distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.  
  In determining how to allocate cash resources in the future, we will initially consider the source of the cash. We anticipate using a portion of cash generated from operations, after payments of periodic operating expenses and interest expense, to fund certain capital expenditures required for our timberlands. Any remaining cash generated from operations may be used to partially fund timberland acquisitions and pay distributions to stockholders. Therefore, to the extent that cash flows from operations are lower, timberland acquisitions and stockholder distributions are anticipated to be lower as well. Capital expenditures, including new timberland acquisitions, are generally funded with cash from operations or existing debt availability; however, proceeds from future debt financings and equity offerings may be used to fund capital expenditures, acquire new timberland properties and pay down existing and future borrowings. 
    
  Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $27.2 million  , a   $3.5 million   increase from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by an increase of   $5.5 million   in net timber sales and a   $0.6 million   increase in net cash received from timberland sales, offset by increases in cash paid for interest, forestry management fees and general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $115.6 million  , a   $85.4 million   increase from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We acquired   60,400   acres of timberland during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to   17,600   acres during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $94.1 million  , an increase of   $93.7 million   from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of a   $94.1 million   increase in net borrowings due to our 2016 Timberland Acquisitions and a   $1.6 million   decrease in share repurchases (see   Share Repurchase Program   below  )  , offset by an increase of   $1.4 million   in financing costs paid.  
    
  We believe that we have access to adequate liquidity and capital resources, including cash flow generated from operations, cash on-hand, and borrowing capacity, necessary to meet our current and future obligations that become due over the next 12 months. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a cash balance of   $13.8 million   and had access to   $200.9 million   of additional borrowing availability under the 2014 Amended Credit Facilities (see   2014 Amended Credit Agreement   below).  
    
  Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Over the long-term, we expect our primary sources of capital to include net cash flows from operations, including proceeds from timberland sales, proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, and public offerings of equity or debt securities. Our principal demands for capital include operating expenses, interest expense on any outstanding indebtedness, certain capital expenditures (other than timberland acquisitions), repayment of debt, timberland acquisitions, and stockholder distributions.  
    
  Our bylaws preclude us from incurring debt in excess of 200% of our net assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt-to-net-assets ratio as a percentage of our total gross assets (other than intangibles) less total liabilities, was approximately   55%  . Our debt-to-net-assets ratio will vary based on our level of current and future borrowings, which will depend on  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

the level of net cash flows from operations, our acquisition activities, and proceeds raised from public offerings of our common stock. Before additional borrowings and equity issuances, principal payments, and timberland acquisitions or dispositions, we expect our debt-to-net-assets ratio to remain relatively stable in the near future.  
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On August 7, 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $30.0 million of our common stock at management's discretion. The program has no set duration and the board may discontinue or suspend the program at any time. There were no common stock repurchases during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 38.8 million shares of common stock outstanding and may repurchase up to an additional $21.2 million under the program. The 2014 Amended Credit Facilities allows us to borrow up to $25.0 million under the 2014 Multi-Draw Term Facility to repurchase our common stock. Management believes that opportunistic repurchases of our common stock is a prudent use of capital resources. 
    
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations are as follows: 

(2)   
    Amounts include the impact of two interest rate swaps. See   Note 5       Interest Rate Swaps   of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
               (3)   
    Includes payment obligation on approximately 7,330 acres that are subleased to a third party.  
               (4)   
    Represents net present value of future payments to satisfy a liability assumed upon a timberland acquisition.   
       
  2014 Amended Credit Agreement 
    
  The 2014 Amended Credit Agreement provides for borrowing under credit facilities consisting of: 
             
    a $35 million revolving credit facility (the  2014 Revolving Credit Facility  
         
  The 2014 Amended Credit Facilities may be increased, upon the agreement of lenders willing to increase their loans, by an additional $110 million. The table below presents the details of our 2014 Amended Credit Facilities as of   September 30, 2016  : 

20 

     Table of Contents  

Patronage 
    
  As a result of entering into the 2014 Amended Credit Agreement, we have become eligible to receive annual patronage refunds from our lenders. The annual patronage refund is dependent on the weighted average debt balance with each participating lender, as calculated by CoBank, for the respective fiscal year under the eligible patronage loans, as well as the financial performance of the Patronage Banks. In March 2016, we received a patronage refund of   $1.2 million   on our borrowings under the eligible patronage loans that were outstanding during 2015. Of the total amount received, 75% was received in cash and 25% was received in equity in Patronage Banks.  The equity component of the patronage refund is redeemable for cash only at the discretion of the Patronage Banks' board of directors and then only if its minimum capital standards are met. The Patronage Banks targeted equity threshold for redemption is based on the percentage of the five-year historical average loan balance. 
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The 2014 Amended Credit Agreement contains, among others, the following financial covenants:  
             
    limits the LTV ratio to   45%   at the end of each fiscal quarter and upon the sale or acquisition of any property;  
                
    requires us to maintain a FCCR of not less than 1.05:1; and 
                
    requires maintenance of a minimum liquidity balance of no less than   $20.0 million   at any time. 
       
  We were in compliance with the financial covenants of the 2014 Amended Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Results of Operations 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our results of operations are materially impacted by the fluctuating nature of timber prices, changes in the levels and composition of our harvest volumes, the level of timberland acquisitions and sales, changes to associated depletion rates, and varying interest expense based on the amount and cost of outstanding borrowings. Timber prices, harvest volumes, and changes in the levels and composition of each for our timberlands for the three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are shown in the following tables:  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

(1)       Includes chip-n-saw and sawtimber.  
            (2)    
    Prices per ton are rounded to the nearest dollar and shown on a stumpage basis (i.e., net of contract logging and hauling costs) and, as such, the sum of these prices multiplied by the tons sold does not equal timber sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

22 

     Table of Contents  

As expected, our net stumpage pricing stayed flat during the third quarter. Compared to the same periods in 2015, our pulpwood pricing improved while sawtimber pricing was lower. The higher pulpwood pricing was due to increases in demand as a result of significant wet weather in the U.S. South. Our pulpwood stumpage prices also benefited from the expansion into the South Carolina and Coastal Georgia markets, which offered some of the highest pulpwood prices in the U.S. South. Our sawtimber pricing was lower partly due to higher mix of chip-n-saw in our harvest volume for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015. Additionally, we opportunistically took advantage of a stronger lumber market during the first half of 2015 and realized better sawtimber prices.  
    
  Our realized stumpage prices, while trending with the overall South-wide timber market as tracked by Timber Mart-South, are generally higher than the South-wide average (weighted by our mix) due to the premiums offered by the micro-markets in which we operate.  
    
  We expect that our sawtimber and pulpwood pricing will remain flat during the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Comparison of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     versus the   three months ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues.   Revenues increased to   $18.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $17.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to an increase in timber sales revenue of   $3.4 million   offset by a decrease in timberland sales revenue of   $2.4 million   and a decrease of   $0.3 million   in other revenues. Gross timber sales revenue increased   27%   as a result of a   24%   increase in harvest volume and increases in pulpwood pricing. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we generated   $2.9 million   of timber sales revenue from properties acquired within the last 12 months, predominantly driven by harvest in the Carolinas.  
    
  Details of timber sales by product for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and 2016 are shown in the following table:  

(1)   
    Timber sales are presented on a gross basis.  
               (2)   
    Includes chip-n-saw and sawtimber. 
       
  Timberland sales revenue decreased to   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to selling fewer acres in 2016. Other revenues decreased to   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   due to receiving $0.5 million in easement income in 2015. 
    
  Operating expenses.   Contract logging and hauling costs increased to   $6.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $4.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of a 31% increase in delivered sales volume. Delivered sales as a percentage of our total harvest volume increased to 64% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from 61% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The delivered sales volume increases were predominantly driven by the implementation of delivered wood sales on properties acquired since our listed public offering. 
    
  Depletion expense increased to   $7.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $6.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of a   24%   increase in harvest volume, offset by lower blended depletion rates. Our blended depletion rates were lower in the current year due to a decrease in harvest from timber deeds, which deplete at higher rates than our long-term fee timber.

Costs of timberland sales decreased to   $0.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due to selling fewer acres in 2016. Other operating expenses increased to   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of higher property taxes and other costs associated with having more acres under management.  
    
  Forestry management expenses increased to   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $1.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to higher cash and non-cash compensation costs for our forest management staff and higher forestry management fees as a result of the growth of our timberland portfolio. 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased to   $2.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $1.7 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increases in compensation costs and dead deal costs. Compensation expenses increased by $0.3 million due to increased staffing and the incremental stock-based compensation cost from implementing the 2016 LTIP program. 
    
  Interest expense.   Interest expense increased to   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to a   $1.3 million   increase in cash paid for interest as a result of a higher average debt balance through the period and higher interest rates under our variable-rate debt, offset by an increase in accrued patronage refunds of   $0.4 million  .  
    
  Net loss.   Our net loss increased to   $2.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of a   $1.0 million   increase in our interest expense. Our net loss per share for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.07   and   $0.05  , respectively. We anticipate future net losses to fluctuate with timber prices, harvest volumes, timberland sales, and interest expense based on our level of current and future borrowings. 
    
  Comparison of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   versus the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenues.   Revenues increased to   $61.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $52.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to an increase in timber sales revenue of   $9.3 million   and an increase in timberland sales revenue of   $0.4 million  , offset by a decrease in other revenue of   $0.3 million  . Gross timber sales revenue increased   24%   as a result of a   22%   increase in harvest volume and increases in pulpwood pricing. We generated $5.7 million of timber sales revenue from properties acquired within the last 12 months. Properties held longer than 12 months contributed another $3.6 million to the increase in the timber sales revenue primarily driven by volume increases. 
    
  Details of timber sales by product for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and 2016 are shown in the following table:  

(1)   
    Timber sales are presented on a gross basis.  
               (2)   
    Includes chip-n-saw and sawtimber. 
       
  Timberland sales revenue increased to   $10.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $10.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to selling more acres in 2016. Our average sales price per acre sold decreased in the current year as we retained the harvest rights to approximately 101,000 tons of merchantable timber

on the acreage sold, which has a book value of $2.4 million. Other revenues decreased to   $3.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to receiving $0.5 million in easement income in 2015. 
    
  Operating expenses.   Contract logging and hauling costs increased to   $18.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $14.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of a 24% increase in delivered sales volume. Delivered sales as a percentage of our total harvest was 63% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to 62% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The delivered sales volume increase was predominantly driven by the implementation of delivered wood sales on properties acquired since our listed public offering. 
    
  Depletion expense increased to   $20.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $19.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to a   22%   increase in harvest volume, offset by lower blended depletion rates. Our blended depletion rates were lower in the current year due to a decrease in harvest from timber deeds, which deplete at higher rates than our long-term fee timber.  
    
  Costs of timberland sales increased to   $9.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $8.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to selling more acres. Other operating expenses increased to   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of higher property taxes and other costs associated with having more acres under management.  
    
  Forestry management expenses increased to   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , due to higher cash and non-cash compensation costs for our forest management staff and higher forestry management fees as a result of the growth of our timberland portfolio. 
    
  General and administrative expenses increased to   $6.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in employee compensation expenses, a $0.3 million increase in independent director compensation expense, and a $0.1 million increase in dead deal costs. Employee compensation costs increased by $0.7 million, due to increased staffing and incremental stock-based compensation costs from the implementation of 2016 LTIP program. Independent directors' compensation cost increased primarily as a result of issuing fully-vested stock in 2016 pursuant to an amended and restated directors' compensation plan (See   Note 7   Stock-based Compensation   in the accompanying consolidated financial statements).  
    
  Interest expense.   Interest expense increased to   $4.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $2.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily due to a   $2.5 million   increase in cash paid for interest as a result of higher average debt balance through the period and higher interest rates under our variable-rate debt, offset by an increase in accrued patronage refunds of   $0.7 million  .  
    
  Net loss.   Our net loss increased to   $6.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $5.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of a   $2.0 million   increase in our interest expense offset by a   $1.0 million   decrease in operating loss. Our net loss per share for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.16   and   $0.13  , respectively. We anticipate future net losses to fluctuate with timber prices, harvest volumes, timberland sales, and interest expense based on our level of current and future borrowings. 

Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  The discussion below is intended to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance and our ability to satisfy lender requirements.   EBITDA   is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance. EBITDA is defined by the SEC; however, we have excluded certain other expenses due to their non-cash nature, and we refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. As such, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income or cash from operations as measurements of our operating performance. Due to the significant amount of timber assets subject to depletion and the significant  
  
   25 

amount of financing subject to interest and amortization expense, management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of our financial condition and performance. The 2014 Amended Credit Agreement contains a minimum debt service coverage ratio based, in part, on Adjusted EBITDA since this measure is representative of adjusted income available for interest payments.  
    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA was   $7.2 million  , a   $1.6 million   decrease from the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a   $2.2 million   decrease in net timberland sales, a   $0.3 million   decrease in other revenues, a   $0.4 million   increase in general and administrative expenses and a   $0.4 million   increase in forestry management expenses, offset by a   $1.7 million   increase in net timber sales. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA was   $29.3 million  , a   $4.1 million   increase from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a   $5.5 million   increase in net timber sales and a   $0.6 million   increase in net timberland sales, offset by a   $0.3 million   decrease in other revenues, a   $0.7 million   increase in general and administrative expenses and a   $0.9 million   increase in forestry management expenses. 
    
  Our reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   follows: 

(1)    
    For the purpose of the above reconciliation, amortization includes amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of intangible lease assets, and amortization of mainline road costs, which are included in either interest expense, land rent expense, or other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 

Election as a REIT 
    
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2009. To qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our adjusted taxable income, as defined in the Code, to our stockholders, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding our net capital gain. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 

Inflation 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of the Mahrt Timberland, we entered into the Mahrt Timber Agreements with WestRock. The Mahrt Timber Agreements provide that we will sell to WestRock specified amounts of timber subject to quarterly market pricing adjustments and monthly fuel pricing adjustments, which are intended to protect us from,  
  
   26 

and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. The price of timber has generally increased with increases in inflation; however, we have not noticed a significant impact from inflation on our revenues, net sales, or income from continuing operations. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform to GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses would have been recorded, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements or different amounts reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
  A discussion of the accounting policies that management deems critical because they may require complex judgment in their application or otherwise require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain, is provided below. 
  Timber Assets 
  Timber and timberlands, including logging roads, are stated at cost less accumulated depletion for timber harvested and accumulated amortization. We capitalize timber and timberland purchases. Reforestation costs, including all costs associated with stand establishment, such as site preparation, costs of seeds or seedlings, planting, fertilization and herbicide application, are capitalized. Timber carrying costs, such as real estate taxes, insect control, wildlife control, leases of timberlands and forestry management personnel salaries and fringe benefits, are expensed as incurred. Costs of major roads are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Costs of roads built to access multiple logging sites over numerous years are capitalized and amortized over seven years. Costs of roads built to access a single logging site are expensed as incurred.  
  Depletion 
  We recognize depletion expense as timber is harvested. Depletion rates are calculated at least annually using the straight-line method by dividing (a) the remaining merchantable inventory book value by (b) the current standing timber inventory volume. 
    
  Evaluating the Recoverability of Timber Assets 
  We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our timber assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present that suggest that the carrying amounts of timber assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Impairment losses would be recognized for (i) long-lived assets used in our operations when the carrying value of such assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from the future operations of those assets, and (ii) long-lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of such assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs. Estimated fair values are calculated based on the following information in order of preference, dependent upon availability: (i) recently quoted market prices, (ii) market prices for comparable properties, or (iii) the present value of undiscounted cash flows, including estimated salvage value. We intend to use one harvest cycle for the purpose of evaluating the recoverability of timber and timberlands used in our operations. Future cash flow estimates are based on probability-weighted projections for a range of possible outcomes and are discounted at risk-free rates of interest. We consider assets to be held for sale at the point at which a sale contract is executed and the buyer has made a nonrefundable earnest money deposit against the contracted purchase price. We have determined that there has been no impairment of our long-lived assets to date.

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of timberland properties, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets, consisting of timberland and timber, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include values associated with in-place leases or supply agreements, based in each case on our estimate of their fair values. The fair values of timberland and timber are determined based on available market information and estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount factors and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The values are then allocated to timberland and timber based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. 
  Intangible Lease Assets 
  In-place ground leases with us as the lessee have value associated with effective contractual rental rates that are below market rates. Such values are calculated based on the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease. The capitalized below-market in-place lease values are recorded as intangible lease assets and are amortized as adjustments to land rent expense over the weighted-average remaining term of the respective leases. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue from the sale of timber is recognized when the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, (ii) legal ownership and the risk of loss are transferred to the purchaser, (iii) price and quantity are determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Our primary sources of revenue are recognized as follows: 
           (1) 
    For delivered sales contracts, which include amounts sufficient to cover costs of logging and hauling of timber, revenues are recognized upon delivery to the customer. 
              (2) 
    For pay-as-cut contracts, the purchaser acquires the right to harvest specified timber on a tract, at an agreed-upon price per unit. Payments and contract advances are recognized as revenue as the timber is harvested based on the contracted sale rate per unit. 
              (3) 
    Revenues from the sale of HBU timberland and nonstrategic timberlands are recognized when title passes and full payment or a minimum down payment is received and full collectability is assured. If a down payment of less than the minimum down payment is received at closing, we will record revenue based on the installment method. 
              (4) 
    For recreational leases, rental income collected in advance is recorded as other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until earned over the term of the respective recreational lease and recognized as other revenue. 
       
  In addition to the sources of revenue noted above, we also may enter into lump-sum sale contracts, whereby the purchaser generally pays the purchase price upon execution of the contract. Title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer at the time the contract is consummated. Revenues are recognized upon receipt of the purchase price. When the contract expires, ownership of the remaining standing timber reverts to us; however, adjustments are not made to the revenues previously recognized. Any extensions of time will be negotiated under a new or amended contract. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  We are subject to certain commitments and contingencies with regard to certain transactions. Refer to   Note 6  Commitments and Contingencies   to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further explanation. Examples of such commitments and contingencies include: 
               
    Mahrt Timber Agreements;  
     
   28 

Timberland Operating Agreement; 
                  
    Obligations under Operating Leases; and 
                  
    Litigation. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition or changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
   
  Subsequent Event 
    
  Dividend declaration 
    
  On November 3, 2016, CatchMark Timber Trust declared a cash dividend of   $0.135   per share for its Class A common stockholders of record on November 30, 2016, payable on December 16, 2016.           
   
  ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  As a result of entering into our credit agreement, we are exposed to interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we have entered into interest rate swaps from time to time, and may enter into other interest rate swaps, caps or other arrangements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes; however, certain of our derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All of our debt was entered into for other than trading purposes. We manage our ratio of fixed-to-floating-rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that we believe is appropriate in light of anticipated changes in interest rates. We closely monitor interest rates and will continue to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities to determine whether we have appropriately guarded ourselves against the risk of increasing interest rates in future periods. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $299.1 million   outstanding under the 2014 Amended Credit Facilities, of which   $100.0 million   matures on   December 23, 2024   and   $199.1 million   matures on   December 23, 2021  . The loans bear interest at a LIBOR Rate plus a margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.75%   based upon the then-current LTV ratio (see   Note 4   Note Payable and Line of Credit   of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the applicable margin and current interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $80.0 million   of our total debt outstanding is subject to an effectively fixed-interest rate when coupled with our two interest rate swaps (see   Note 5   Interest Rate Swaps   of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Under our interest rate swaps, we pay interest at a weighted-average fixed rate of   1.768%   per annum and receive variable LIBOR-based interest payments from the Rabobank. As of   September 30, 2016  , these balances incurred interest expense at an average rate of   3.520%  . A change in the market interest rate impacts the net financial instrument position of the interest rate swaps; however, it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , after consideration of our interest rate swaps, approximately   $219.1 million   of our total debt outstanding is subject to an effectively variable-interest rate. This balance incurred interest expense at an average rate of   2.73%   as of   September 30, 2016  . A   1.0%   change in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately   $2.2 million   per year. The amount of effectively variable-rate debt outstanding in the future will be largely dependent upon the level of cash from operations and the rate at which we are able to employ such proceeds toward repayment of the 2014 Amended Credit Facilities and acquisition of timberland properties.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Management s Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods in SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
