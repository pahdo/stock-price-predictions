These forward looking statements are based on our management s current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,   proposed,   intended,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other  forward-looking  information. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: variability of our future revenues and financial performance; risks associated with product development and technological changes; the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by potential future customers; general economic conditions. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially are discussed in greater detail in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on January 20, 2016.       You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

     Table of Contents          AXIOM HOLDINGS, INC.     Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Axiom Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) is a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 7, 2013, as At Play Vacations, Inc. It is based in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company incorporated wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quality Resort Hotels, Inc. ( QRH ) in Florida on August 8, 2013 and Horizon Resources Co. Ltd ( Horizon ) in the Cayman Islands on September 7, 2015. On June 23, 2016, QRH was legally dissolved with the state of FL (see note 5). The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and The Company s fiscal year end is December 31.      NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Unaudited Interim Financial Statements       The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-KT, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.       Basis of Presentation       The Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) of the United States.      On October 1, 2015, we changed our fiscal year from September 30 to December 31, effective beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015.                  8       
     Table of Contents           Basis of Consolidation       These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the wholly-owned subsidiary, Horizon Resources Co. Ltd. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.        Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had no cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.        Due to Related Party       The Company follows ASC 850,   Related Party Disclosures,   for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.       Financial Instruments        The Company follows ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ,  which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:       Level 1      Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2      Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.                 9       
     Table of Contents          Level 3      Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company s cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the Company s other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.       Revenue Recognition       The Company recognizes revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.       Net Loss per Share of Common Stock       The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share,   ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.       Discontinued Operations       The Company follows ASC 205-20,   Discontinued Operations,   to report for disposed or discontinued operations.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.      NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a net loss from operations of $29,817 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and an accumulated deficit of $189,220 as of September 30, 2016. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.           The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.     These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      NOTE 4 - DUE TO RELATED PARTY      As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company was obligated to our then Chief Executive Officer, who is also a significant stockholder, for a non-interest bearing demand loan with a balance of $66,560 and $39,443, respectively. This officer subsequently resigned in February 2016, but still remains a significant shareholder in the Company.      NOTE 5 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS      The Company originally intended to be involved in the business of on-line travel and vacation booking. Based on management s analysis of the current operations, expected growth, and opportunities in the sector, in April, 2016, the Company has determined to discontinue operations related to on-line travel booking which was performed under the Company s subsidiary Quality Resort Hotels, Inc. Effective June 23, 2016, Quality Resort Hotels, Inc., was legally dissolved with the State of Florida.     As the operations of Quality Resort Hotels, Inc. have been discontinued and the company legally dissolved, the Company has excluded results of the operations from its Consolidated Statement of Operations.     The discontinued operations did not have any assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the discontinued operations consisted of the following:                  NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      As filed in a Form 8K on October 10, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission:     On October 10, 2016, the Company appointed Curtis Riley as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to succeed Low Tuan Lee who resigned those positions with the Company. In addition, Mr. Riley has been appointed as a member of the Company s Board of Directors. Mr. Lee had no disagreements with the Company.     Share Exchange Agreement     On October 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ) with CJC Holdings, Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  CJC ) and the two shareholders of CJC, Hu Dengyang and Yang Chuan (the  CJC Shareholders ). CJC, through its subsidiaries, operates and constructs hydropower electric generation stations located in China with two in operation, a third under construction and a fourth in the planning stage and slated for operation in 2019. In addition, CJC, through its subsidiaries, operates two hotels in China. A more general discussion of CJC s operations is included below.     Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of CJC from the CJC Shareholders in exchange for the issuance to the CJC Shareholders of 200,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ).     In connection with the transactions contemplated under the Agreement, the Company will cancel 200,000,000 shares of its Common Stock currently outstanding prior to the closing of the transactions, and therefore the shares of Common Stock issued to the CJC Shareholders in the transactions pursuant to the Agreement will represent approximately 58.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s Common Stock at the closing of such transactions. As of October 10, 2016, the Company has 340,000,000 shares of Common stock issued and outstanding. The acquisition of the shares of CJC and the cancellation of the shares of Company s Common Stock as described herein, together with the other transactions described in the Agreement, are collectively referred to herein as the  Transactions.  Upon completion of the closing of the Transactions, CJC will become a subsidiary of the Company.     Any party may terminate the Agreement if the closing of the Transactions does not occur by February 15, 2017 (unless such failure was due to a breach of the Agreement by such party).

The following table provides selected financial data about our company as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 .            The Company did not have a cash balance at either September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total assets increased by 50% or $2,500, due to increased prepaid expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses related to the discontinued operation for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $16,150.

Our working deficiency increased $29,817 as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, due to $32,217 increase in liabilities, offset by $2,500 increase in prepaid expenses.      Cash Flows                         For the Nine Months Ended                       September 30,                       2016                2015            Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities        $  -            $  (8,514  )     Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities             -                 -          Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities             -                 -          Net Increase (decrease) in Cash During Period        $  -            $  (8,514  )         Cash Flows from Operating Activities      We have not generated positive cash flow from operating activities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, we did not generate any cash from financing activities.            Going Concern      Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our year-end financial statements ended December 31, 2015. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay for our expenses. This is because we have generated limited revenues and have limited operating history. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through either private placements, bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.     Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, due to our limited number of officers and members of the Board of Directors, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
