Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Nature
of Business and Operations Overview   

Cachet
Financial Solutions, Inc. (the  Company ) is a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, financial technology,
or fintech, solutions to the financial services industry. The Company provides traditional financial institutions and alternative
financial service, or AFS, providers with innovative mobile and other solutions to enable them to offer a suite of leading-edge
mobile financial services to their customers through the Internet, or cloud-based, access. As a SaaS provider, the Company develops,
hosts and maintains software solutions that it licenses to its clients. The Company serves three primary markets in the United
States: banks, credit unions and AFS providers, which includes providers of non-traditional banking services such as reloadable
prepaid cards and check cashing services. In the future, the Company intends to expand outside of the United States, including
Latin America and Europe, as opportunities present themselves.  

The
Company has been expanding its suite of available fintech solutions. One of the Company s recent solutions, Select Mobile 
Money, is an award-winning prepaid mobile money platform that seamlessly links various mobile banking features with a prepaid
debit card issued by financial institutions or AFS providers. This solution enables card users to conveniently manage their card
accounts through an easy-to-use integrated mobile application, or app, with multiple features downloaded onto their smart phone
or tablet and, by adding a suite of available mobile financial services linked to their card accounts, enhances the card s
usefulness and the cardholder s mobile banking experience. For example, prepaid cardholders using the Company s application
may deposit paper checks and direct payroll deposits into their prepaid card account, access cash from their prepaid card account
at any automated teller machine, or ATM, and check their prepaid card account balance and transaction history. The Company believes
that its Select Mobile Money solution is setting the industry standard for reloadable prepaid mobile money solutions.  

The
Company s Select Mobile Money solutions comprise two distinct mobile banking technology solutions: first, a white label
mobile money platform for larger financial institutions and AFS providers that already have a reloadable prepaid card program
and wish to enhance it by integrating a feature rich app; and second, an end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program, called Select
Mobile Money-Express, or SMM-X, offered to all banks, credit unions and AFS providers of all sizes that would like to deploy a
complete reloadable prepaid card program, comprising a prepaid debit card, an integrated mobile app and program management.  

The
Company s business has historically focused on offering a full suite of consumer and business remote deposit check capture,
or RDC, products that enable financial institutions to provide their customers with the ability to conveniently deposit their
checks remotely anytime, anywhere. While the Company continues to offer these solutions, the Company recently expanded its focus
to include prepaid mobile money solutions. The Company s latest innovations are a mobile remote payment capture solution,
which the Company calls Select Mobile  NowPay, which enables enterprises to accept check payments submitted via their customers 
mobile devices, and the Company s mobile account opening solution, which the Company calls Select Mobile  Account
Opening, which streamlines the account opening process by utilizing photo imaging to capture customer data and auto-populate an
account opening application form for checking, savings, credit card and other types of accounts.  

The
Company s business operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cachet Financial Solutions Inc., a Minnesota
corporation (the  Subsidiary ). The Company was incorporated in Delaware in February 2010. In February 2014, the Company
acquired the business of the Subsidiary, and changed its corporate name to  Cachet Financial Solutions, Inc.   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with
the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Articles 8 and 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The information furnished includes all adjustments
and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results
for the interim periods. The Subsidiary is the only entity with operational activity and therefore no intercompany transactions
exist with the parent entity which would require elimination. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained within the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016 (the  10-K ).  

Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications did not
have an impact on reported net loss for any of the periods presented.  

Capital
Structure Change   

On
June 2, 2016, the board of directors of the Company (the  Board of Directors ) adopted resolutions approving and recommending
to the Company s shareholders to approve a proposal to amend the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
to effect a reverse split of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, which was subsequently approved by the Company s
shareholders, and the ratio was set by the Board of Directors at 1:15 (the  Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock
Split became effective on July 27, 2016. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company s historical financial statements
have been revised to reflect share counts and per share data as if the Reverse Stock Split had been in effect for all periods
presented.

NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going
concern. From inception to September 30, 2016, the Company has accumulated a deficit of approximately $81.5 million, and, as of
September 30, 2016, current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $7.6 million. The Company believes, based on
its current cash flow forecast, it has enough cash to continue operations through December 31, 2016 and beyond. This forecast
is dependent upon successful completion of the October Private Placement (described below). If the Company does not successfully
complete the October Private Placement, the Company may not be able to continue operations.  

In
October 2016, the Company commenced a private placement (the  October Private Placement ), in which it intends to
raise up to $8.0 million of cash proceeds to fund its marketing and sales activities, working capital, debt service and
other corporate purposes. See Note 12  Subsequent Events.   

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   

There
have been so significant changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, other than the updates described below and in the subsequent notes. Further information regarding the Company s
significant accounting policies can be found in the 10-K.  

Net
Loss Per Common Share   

Basic
and diluted net loss per common share for all periods presented is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and common share equivalents outstanding, when dilutive. Potentially
dilutive common share equivalents include common shares which would potentially be issued pursuant to stock warrants, stock options,
convertible preferred stock and convertible note agreements. Common share equivalents are not included in determining the fully
diluted loss per share if their effect is antidilutive.  

The
following table reflects the amounts used in determining net loss per share:  

The
following potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share from continuing operations and
diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods
presented:  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments for certain financial instruments and to determine fair
value disclosures. Warrants issued with price protection features are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company
considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable to approximate fair value
due to the short maturity of these instruments. With respect to the determination of fair values of financial instruments, there
are the following three levels of inputs:  

Level
1 Inputs   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  

Level
2 Inputs   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.  

Level
3 Inputs   Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.  

CACHET
FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The
warrants that are carried at fair value are valued using level 3 inputs utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model under probability-weighted
estimated outcomes. The conversion features that are carried at fair value are valued by a third-party valuation specialist. There
were no transfers into or out of level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that may affect certain reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, the
allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used to value stock options and warrants, conversion incentive and share purchase
price adjustment, and the value of shares of common stock issued for services.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

On
May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The core principle of the ASU is for companies to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration, or payment, to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU may also result in enhanced disclosures about
revenue. For public entities, the ASU was to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. On July
9, 2015, the FASB voted to allow a one year deferral of the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017. The deferral permits early adoption, but does not allow adoption any earlier than the original effective date of the
standard. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have
on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as
a Going Concern.   The amendments provide guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there
is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
The standard will be effective for the Company s year ended December 31, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The adoption
of this pronouncement may impact future assessment and disclosures related to the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which modifies
the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt
liability rather than as an asset. The ASU became effective for public companies during interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this ASU as of March 31, 2016 on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 4  Financing
Arrangements  and Note 6  Commitments and Contingencies  for further details.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  
which requires that most equity instruments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net
income. The pronouncement also impacts the financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for financial instruments. The ASU does not apply to equity method investments or investments in consolidated subsidiaries.
The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and amendments to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet in
the year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02   Leases,   which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed
purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest
method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months, regardless of their classification. Leases with
a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new standard supersedes
the previous leasing standard. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU
affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of
accounting for share-based payment award transactions, which include the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. The revised guidance
is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses,   which introduces new
guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on
current expected credit losses ( CECL ) on certain types of financial instruments and expands disclosure requirements
regarding an entities assumptions, models and methods for estimating CECL. Generally, the CECL and subsequent changes to the estimate
will be reported in current earnings through an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets. The revised guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated
financial statements and disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows,   which is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the consolidated statements of cash
flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including for interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Prepaid Expenses   

Prepaid
expenses of $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of prepaid offering costs, licenses and maintenance fees,
or deposits with, the providers of RDC software capabilities to the Company. In October 2016, the Company decided not to proceed
with the offering pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-212610) previously filed by
the Company with the SEC (the  Registration Statement,  and collectively, the  Offering ). As a result,
the Company will recognize as an expense the prepaid costs associated with the Offering in the fourth quarter of 2016.
See Note 12  Subsequent Events.  Prepaid expenses of approximately $286,000 as of December 31, 2015 primarily consisted
of licenses and maintenance fees, or deposits with, the providers of RDC software capabilities to the Company.

Financing Arrangements   

The
Company has obtained debt financing through bank loans, loans from directors and other affiliated parties and unaffiliated third
party investors. Certain of the debt was issued with warrants that permit the investor to acquire shares of the Company s
common stock at prices as specified in the individual agreements. See Note 8  Shareholders  Deficit.

Future
maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):  

Notes
Payable to Directors and Affiliates   

The
Company has historically relied on two directors of the Company, Michael J. Hanson ( Mr. Hanson ) and James L. Davis
( Mr. Davis,  and collectively with Mr. Hanson,  Messrs. Hanson and Davis ), to provide financing to fund
the Company s operations. See Note 10  Related Party Transactions.   

Convertible
Term Loan, due December 2016, interest at 10%   

In
December 2013, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Trooien Capital, LLC ( Trooien Capital, 
and the Company refers to this note as the  Trooien Capital Note ) for a principal amount of up to $4 million. Borrowings
under the Trooien Capital Note bear interest at 10% and mature in December 2016. Under the agreement, Trooien Capital has the
right, but not the obligation, to advance additional amounts up to the $4 million. Trooien Capital has the right to request shares
of common stock, rather than cash, as payment for interest. Trooien Capital had two conversion rights under the Trooien Capital
Note, the first of which has expired. Under the second conversion right, Trooien Capital has the right, through the maturity date
of the note, to convert the principal and accrued interest into common stock at a conversion rate equal to 125% of the price at
which the common stock was sold in the Company s July 2014 initial public offering. Under the terms of this conversion agreement,
Trooien Capital will receive 100% warrant coverage. On or about May 24, 2016, Trooien Capital commenced legal action against the
Company. See Note 6  Commitments and Contingencies.   

Convertible
Notes, due 2016 and 2017, interest at 0%   

For
accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the debt, warrants and conversion features of the following convertible notes using
an allocation process. As a result, the reported amount of the debt has been reduced and will be accreted to face value through
each of the maturity dates.

Convertible
notes that will convert upon listing   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued to several investors convertible notes, which are unsecured and do
not bear any interest. Each of the investors may elect to convert the principal amount of the notes into shares of the Company s
common stock at any time before the maturity date of the notes at a conversion price equal to the lower of $5.55 and 80% of the
per share sale price of the Company s common stock in its next underwritten public offering. The Company has the right to
require each of the investors to convert the notes into shares of its common stock at that conversion price if the Company s
common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In addition,
under the Company s agreement with each of the investors, it is required to file with the SEC a registration statement covering
the resale of the shares of its common stock issuable under the notes and the warrants within 21 days after the offering, or 90
days following the date on which the Company s current financing plan is terminated. If the Company fails to file a registration
statement in a timely manner, the Company will be required to issue to each of the investors additional warrants to purchase shares
of its common stock. The following table provides additional information about each financing.  

Convertible

On
June 9, 2016, the Company agreed to issue to each of Old Main Capital, LLC ,  River North Equity, LLC, Kodiak Capital Group,
LLC, and DiamondRock, LLC (collectively, the  June 9, 2016 Investors ) a convertible note in the principal amount
of up to $450,000 and a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, subject to adjustments, in exchange for
an aggregate purchase price of $375,000, payable by each of the June 9, 2016 Investors in two tranches. On June 9, 2016, each
of the June 9, 2016 Investors funded the first tranche of this investment, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $1.0
million.  

The
notes do not bear any interest, other than during an event of default. Each tranche funded under a note is due and payable in
full six months after the date of funding. The first tranche is due on December 9, 2016. In addition to providing three
days  advance written notice to the June 9, 2016 Investors, under the terms of each note upon repayment of the note (including
on the maturity date), the Company is obligated to pay a 20% premium on the then outstanding principal and any accrued default
interest then due on the note, which in the aggregate is equal to 120% of the then outstanding principal and any accrued default
interest then due on the note.  

Series
Subordinated Note, due January 2016, interest at 12%   

The
series subordinated note was due in January 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not repaid the note. On March 31,
2016, the holder of the note commenced legal action against the Company. See Note 6  Commitments and Contingencies.   

Notes
Payable, due October 2016, interest between 8.25% and 12%   

In
January 2014, the Company assumed notes payable in connection with the reverse merger transaction pursuant to which the Company
acquired the Subsidiary. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid three of the notes for approximately
$11,000, including principal and accrued interest. During 2016, the Company also extended the maturity date of the remaining notes
to August 2016 and then to October 2016. As of the date that these financial statements were  available to be
issued, the Company has not yet repaid these notes but is actively negotiating with the lender to further extend the maturity
date of the notes. 

Note
Payable, due August 2021, interest at 0%   

In
August 2014, the Company entered into a 0% interest, $192,000 note payable to the State of Minnesota as part of an angel loan
program fund. There are no financial loan covenants associated with the loan, which has a maturity date of August 2021. The loan
contains a provision whereby if the Company transfers more than a majority of its ownership, the loan becomes immediately due,
along with a 30% premium amount of the principal balance. In addition, if the Company is more than 30 days past due on any payments
owed under the loan, the interest rate increases to 20% per annum.

Installment
Note Payable   Bank   

In
January 2016, the Company entered into an installment note payable with a bank, replacing a previous note, for a principal amount
of approximately $330,000. The company received the net amount between the two notes, or approximately $69,000, which was primarily
used for working capital purposes. The note bears interest at the prime rate plus 1%, but not less than 5%. The note is due in
January 2019. The prime rate of interest was 3.50% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Litigation   

Cachet
Banq   

An
entity named Cachet Banq contacted the Company in December 2010 relative to their U.S. Trademark Registration No. 2,857,465 (registered
on June 29, 2004) for the standard character mark  CACHET  covering  financial services, namely automated clearing
house processing services for the payroll service industry.  Cachet Banq has alleged that the Company s use of  CACHET 
infringes on their federal trademark registration. On or about March 4, 2013, Cachet Banq filed a trademark infringement lawsuit
against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The parties filed cross motions
for summary judgment. The initial brief was filed on May 30, 2014, replies were filed on June 26, 2014 and the court took these
motions under advisement on July 8, 2014. The Company has denied that its use of the character mark  CACHET  infringes
on Cachet Banq s purported rights in their mark. On September 21, 2015, the court issued an order (1) granting Cachet Banq s
motion for summary judgment, (2) denying the Company s motion for summary judgment, and (3) ordering the parties to submit
memoranda regarding remedies. The last of those memoranda were submitted on October 12, 2015. On November 30, 2015, the Court
entered an additional order providing for an additional period of discovery and additional briefing regarding remedies. Pursuant
to the Court s order, the parties engaged in a renewed period of discovery focused on remedies and submitted additional
briefing. The discovery was completed and all additional briefing was submitted to the Court by April 19, 2016. According to their
briefing on the remedies, Cachet Banq is not presently seeking any monetary damages as a result of the alleged infringement, but
rather an injunction.  

On
October 27, 2016, the Court entered a judgment and permanent injunction against the Company which, effective from April 15, 2017,
enjoins the Company and its officers, directors, agents, servants, employees and attorneys and all persons in active concert or
participation with any of the foregoing from (i) using any mark, name, symbol, logo or other indicia that incorporates or is confusingly
similar to the term  CACHET  in any way that relates to financial services, and (ii) offering for sale, soliciting
sales, promoting, distributing, importing, advertising, or selling any products or services, in any medium, under any mark, name,
symbol, logo or other indicia that incorporates or is confusingly similar to the term  CACHET  which in any way relate
to financial services. The Company is also ordered to destroy or discard all signs, products, advertisements, packaging, literature,
business cards, and any other promotional material, which feature the term  CACHET  or a term confusingly similar
thereto, both physical and electronic, which are in any way related to financial services, in each case except for the permitted
use described below. Under the injunction, the Company must complete its transition to a yet-to-be determined new company name
by no later than April 15, 2017. The Company is permitted to reference its current name in an explanatory fashion on signs, products,
advertisements, packaging, literature, business cards, and any other promotional material to introduce the new name of the Company
in a font size no greater than one-third the font-size of the yet-to-be determined new company name. This permitted use provision
terminates on June 30, 2017, by which date the Company must cease from using the explanatory statement in any manner and destroy
or discard all materials featuring the explanatory statement. By no later than July 12, 2017, the Company must file a declaration,
under penalty of perjury, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which the Company has complied with the injunction.  

The
Company intends to comply with the injunction and will pursue a re-branding of the Company. The Company has not yet begun to assess
the financial impact of re-branding the Company. While the Company expects that the re-branding of the Company will require the
Company to devote significant resources to advertising and marketing new brands and will cause the Company to incur substantial
costs, the Company has yet to determine the scope of the costs and other implications associated with such re-branding, as such,
the Company has not provided for an accrual of costs associated with complying with the injunction. The Court denied Cachet Banq s
request for attorney s fees and costs. The Company s insurance covered much of the legal fees related to this legal
proceeding and the Company s lawyers agreed to write-off certain accounts payable to them and owed by the Company in excess
of the insurance proceeds received. As a result, the Company has recognized other income of approximately $33,000 and $325,000
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

Series
Subordinated Note   

On
March 31, 2016, the holder of the series subordinated note referred to in Note 4  Financing Arrangements  commenced
an action against the Company in Hennepin County Court in the State of Minnesota, alleging that the Company breached the terms
of the note and seeking to collect alleged amounts due and owing under the note. The holder of the note alleges that the Company
is in default and owes the note holder approximately $695,000 plus interest and assessments accruing after April 1, 2016. The
dispute centers on the note holder s interpretation of the agreement. Based on the note holder s interpretation of
the agreement, the note holder seeks an extraordinary amount in alleged liquidated damages (approximately $300,000 on an outstanding
debt of approximately $415,000). The Company disputes the allegations of the note holder and intends to vigorously defend the
claim. Among other things, the Company contends the note holder s interpretation of the agreement is unenforceable under
Minnesota law. The note holder recently moved for summary judgment and a hearing on that motion was held on August 9, 2016 before
the Fourth Judicial District in Hennepin County in Minnesota where the Court heard both arguments and took the motion under advisement.
On October 19, 2016, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment. The alleged
default could subject the Company to claims of default or cross default by the Company s other lenders. At this time no
other lender has asserted such a claim.  

Trooien
Capital Note   

On
or about May 24, 2016, the Company received notice from Trooien Capital alleging that the Company has not made interest payments
in accordance with the terms of the Trooien Capital Note, and as a result of such alleged breach, all outstanding amounts under
the Trooien Capital Note are accelerated. Pursuant to the Trooien Capital Note, the Subsidiary granted to Trooien Capital a security
interest in all of the Subsidiary s property and assets, including all property that the Subsidiary will acquire in the
future, as collateral security for the payment and performance of the Subsidiary s obligations under the Trooien Capital
Note. The Company disputes Trooien Capital s claim because the Company has been accruing interest expense in accordance
with the terms of the agreement for more than two years and Trooien Capital has not objected to that practice.  

On
or about May 27, 2016, the Subsidiary filed a verified complaint with the Fourth District Court of Hennepin County in Minnesota
naming Trooien Capital as a defendant and seeking a declaratory judgment against Trooien Capital with respect to this claim. On
June 10, 2016, Trooien Capital answered the Subsidiary s complaint and asserted counterclaims. On June 20, 2016, Trooien
Capital moved to appoint a receiver for the Subsidiary. On June 30, 2016, the Company filed a notice of motion and motion to dismiss
a portion of the counterclaims. On July 19, 2016, the Company filed with the Fourth District Court of Hennepin County in Minnesota
a memorandum of law and supporting documents requesting that the Court deny Trooien Capital s motion to appoint a receiver
for the Subsidiary. The Company believes that Trooien Capital s claim is inconsistent with the Trooien Capital Note and
the parties  conduct during the two years since the Subsidiary entered into that agreement. The Company also believes that
Trooien Capital s motion and the remedy sought lacks sufficient evidence and factual support under the applicable legal
standard and that Trooien Capital s motion failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the appointment of
a receiver is necessary. On October 18, 2016, a hearing on the motions was held and the Court took both motions under advisement.
On October 21, 2016, the Court entered an order denying Trooien Capital s motion to appoint a receiver and denying the Company s
motion to dismiss a portion of Trooien Capital s counterclaims.  

Financial
Service Agreements   

In
August 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a firm to provide investor relations and financial advisory services.
The initial six-month term of the agreement required the issuance of 26,667 shares of the Company s common stock and payments
totaling $30,000. After the initial six-month term, the Company had the option to extend for an additional six months which required
issuing the firm additional shares of common stock and payment totaling $30,000. In February 2016, the Company renewed the services
agreement and issued the firm an additional 31,000 shares of common stock for another six months of investor relations and financial
advisory services. The Company renewed the services agreement further in August 2016 and issued to the firm an additional 12,000
shares of common stock.  

In
January 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an independent contractor to provide investor relations, capital raising
services and other consulting duties. The agreement requires annual compensation for services of $100,000 as well as discretionary
bonuses paid in cash or stock based on the consultant s ability to complete particular projects for the Company. The term
of this agreement is for 12 months commencing on January 1, 2016. The agreement is cancelable by either party with a 30-day notice.

Goodwill and Finite Life Intangible Assets   

The
Company assesses the carrying amount of its goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change
in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The Company performs an impairment test for finite-lived assets,
such as intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  

The
Company has only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues, incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial
information for review by the Company s chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, the Company completes its goodwill
impairment testing on this single reporting unit.

FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

In
conducting the annual impairment test of the Company s goodwill, qualitative factors are first examined to determine whether
the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, a two-step impairment test is applied. In the first step, the Company calculates the fair value
of the reporting unit and compares that amount with the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value, the Company performs the second step of measuring the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if
any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill. This requires
performing a hypothetical application of the acquisition method to determine the implied fair value of goodwill after measuring
the reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities.  

The
Company had recorded Goodwill of $204,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company conducted its annual goodwill
impairment test as of December 31, 2015 and determined there to be no indication of impairment related to the Company s
goodwill. The Company does not believe that an indicator of impairment exists as of September 30, 2016 and will continue to monitor
conditions and changes that could indicate an impairment of goodwill.  

Identified
intangible assets are summarized as follows:  

Amortization
expense for identified intangible assets is summarized below:

Convertible
Preferred Stock   

In
June 2015, the Company issued 44,030 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock at $100.00 per share and issued five-year
warrants to purchase 670,475 shares of its common stock at $4.94 per share, as adjusted, in a private placement.  

The
Series C Preferred Stock entitles its holders to a 10% per annum dividend, payable quarterly in cash or in additional shares of
Series C Preferred Stock (or a combination of both) as determined by the Company, and may be converted to the Company s
common stock at the option of a holder at a conversion price of $4.94 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution
conversion price protection allowing the stock s conversion price to adjust, prior to conversion, should the Company sell
common stock at a price below the then current conversion price. The Series C Preferred Stock will automatically convert into
common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) an underwritten public offering of shares of the Company s
common stock providing at least $10 million in gross proceeds, (b) the Company s common stock closing price being greater
than 100% above the conversion price then in effect for at least 40 of 60 consecutive trading days, (c) four years after the closing
of the offering of the Series C Preferred Stock, or (d) the written consent of holders representing 50% of the issued and outstanding
Series C Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote their shares on an as-converted basis
and are entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the stated value (i.e., purchase price) of their shares plus any accrued
but unpaid dividends thereon.  

In
March 2016, an investor converted 500 shares of Series C Convertible Stock at the conversion price of $4.94 per share, as well
as received credit for all unpaid cumulative dividends earned through the date of conversion. The investor received a total of
10,934 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding 43,530 and 44,030,
respectively of its Series C Preferred Stock.

The
Company s common stock issuances for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

Net
proceeds to the Company pursuant to common stock issuances for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $3.6 million.  

Warrants   

The
Company s warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the following:  

Certain
of the Company s warrants have a cashless exercise provision, whereby the Company issues shares of common stock based on
the difference between the weighted-average trading price of the Company s common stock for the five consecutive trading
days ending on the date immediately preceding the date of the warrant exercise and the stated exercise price of the warrants.
As a result of these cashless exercise provisions, the number of common shares issued pursuant to warrant exercises may be different
than the total number of warrants exercised during a given period.

Warrants
that contain anti-dilution price protection are carried as liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until they
are either exercised or no longer subject to anti-dilution protection, after which the value of the warrants is reclassified to
additional paid-in capital. The fair value of warrants recognized as liabilities and carried at fair value is determined each
quarter using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s warrant and conversion feature liabilities consisted of the following:  

(1)  
      Shares
    issuable includes warrants to purchase 170,698 shares of commom stock at $5.55 per share, 186,914 shares of common
    stock at the lower of $5.55 per share and 80% of the per share offering price in the Company s next underwritten
    public offering and 397,345 shares issuable upon conversion of the principal amount of the underlying notes at the conversion
    price of $5.55 per share. The terms of the convertible note agreements specify that the Company will issue shares of common
    stock at the lower of $5.55 per share or 80% of the price paid per share in an underwritten public offering.   

The
Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model when determining the value of warrants issued using the following significant
assumptions:  

Stock
    price:   
      Published
    trading market values of the Company s common stock as of the grant date of the warrants.   
 
       Exercise
    price:   
      The
    stated exercise price of the warrant.   
 
       Expected
    term:   
      The
    Company s assumption of the term of the warrant.   
 
       Expected
    dividend:   
      The
    rate of dividends that the Company expects to pay over the term of the warrant.   
 
       Volatility:   
     For periods prior to the Company s public
    offering, volatility is estimated based on the volatility of comparable peer companies that are publicly traded, and for later
    periods the Company includes its actual common stock trading history.  
 
       Risk-free
    interest rate:   
      The
    daily United States Treasury yield curve rate.   

The
Company obtains a valuation report prepared by a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the fair value of the
conversion features associated with certain of its convertible notes.  

The
fair value of the warrants issued was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions for
the periods presented:  

There
were no warrants issued during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Compensation Expense Information   

The
Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model when determining the compensation cost associated with stock options issued
using the following significant assumptions:  

Stock
    price:   
      Published
    trading market values of the Company s common stock as of the grant date of the stock options.   
 
       Exercise
    price:   
      The
    stated exercise price of the stock option.   
 
       Expected
    term:   
      The
    Company s assumption of the term of the stock options based on historical exercise data.   
 
       Expected
    dividend:   
      The
    rate of dividends that the Company expects to pay over the term of the stock options.   
 
       Volatility:   
     For periods prior to the Company s public
    offering, volatility is estimated based on the volatility of comparable peer companies that are publicly traded, and for later
    periods the Company includes its actual common stock trading history.  
 
       Risk-free
    interest rate:   
      The
    daily United States Treasury yield curve rate.   

The
fair value of the stock options issued was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions
for the periods presented:  

The
Company estimates forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and this estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite
service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes
in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change,
and impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.

Related Party Transactions   

In
order to finance its operations, the Company has historically relied upon Messrs. Hanson and Davis for financing through the issuance
of debt, equity and warrants. Balances with related parties consisting of members of the Board of Directors for borrowings and
warrants were as follows. No debt is held by executive officers of the Company.  

On
May 7, 2014, the Company entered into a $1.5 million line-of-credit agreement with Mr. Hanson, as subsequently amended (the  Line
of Credit ). The stated interest rate on the Line of Credit is 10% on the principal amount outstanding and the maturity
date is January 31, 2017, with all outstanding principal and accrued interest due in full on that date. There are no financial
covenants associated with the Line of Credit. On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment #3 to the borrowing agreement
with Mr. Hanson in connection with the Line of Credit. Pursuant to that amendment, which is effective as of June 30, 2016, the
parties agreed that the Company will make an interest-only payment on January 31, 2017. The interest-only payment is for interest
accrued on the principal balance from February 1, 2016 to date of payment. On October 6, 2016, Mr. Hanson agreed to convert the
$1.0 million owed under the Line of Credit to equity upon consummation of an underwritten public offering. See Note 12  Subsequent

and accrued interest thereon will be due in full. On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into an addendum #4 to this commitment
letter with Mr. Hanson. Pursuant to that addendum, which is effective as of June 30, 2016, the parties extended the payment date
of the interest-only payments that were or will be due and payable to January 31, 2017. The interest-only payments are for interest

upon repayment of the note (including on the maturity date) the Company is obligated to pay a 20% premium on the principal amount
and any accrued default interest then due on the note, which in the aggregate is equal to 120% of the principal amount and any
accrued default interest then due on the note. For accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the debt and warrants using an
allocation process. As a result, the reported amount of the debt has been reduced and will be accreted to face value through each
of the maturity dates. On October 12, 2016, Mr. Davis agreed to convert $250,000 of the $432,000 aggregate amount outstanding

price if the Company s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Global
Select Market. For accounting purposes, the Company accounts for the debt, warrants and conversion features using an allocation

maturity dates.

OVERVIEW   

Cachet
Financial Solutions, Inc. (the  Company,   Cachet,   we,   us,   our )
is a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, financial technology, or fintech, solutions to the financial services
industry. We provide traditional financial institutions and alternative financial service, or AFS, providers with innovative mobile
and other solutions to enable them to offer a suite of leading-edge mobile financial services to their customers through the Internet,
or cloud-based, access. As a SaaS provider, we develop, host and maintain software solutions that we license to our clients. We
serve three primary markets in the United States: banks, credit unions and AFS providers, which includes providers of non-traditional
banking services such as reloadable prepaid cards and check cashing services. In the future, we intend to expand outside of the
United States, including Latin America and Europe, as opportunities present themselves.  

We
have been expanding our suite of available fintech solutions. One of our recent solutions, Select Mobile  Money, is an award-winning
prepaid mobile money platform that seamlessly links various mobile banking features with a prepaid debit card issued by financial
institutions or AFS providers. This solution enables card users, i.e., customers of our client financial institutions or AFS providers,
to conveniently manage their card accounts through an easy-to-use integrated mobile application, or app, with multiple features
that is downloaded onto their smart phone or tablet and, by adding a suite of available mobile financial services linked to their
card accounts, enhances the card s usefulness and the cardholder s mobile banking experience. For example, prepaid
cardholders using our application may deposit paper checks and direct payroll deposits into their prepaid card account, access
cash from their prepaid card account at any automated teller machine, or ATM, and check their prepaid card account balance and
transaction history. We believe that our Select Mobile Money solution is setting the industry standard for reloadable prepaid
mobile money solutions.  

Our
Select Mobile Money solutions comprise two distinct mobile banking technology solutions: first, a white label mobile money platform
for larger financial institutions and AFS providers that already have a reloadable prepaid card program and wish to enhance it
by integrating a feature rich app; and second, an end-to-end reloadable prepaid card program, which we call Select Mobile Money-Express,
or SMM-X, offered to all banks, credit unions and AFS providers of all sizes that would like to deploy a complete reloadable prepaid
card program, comprising a prepaid debit card, an integrated mobile app and program management.  

Our
Select Mobile Money solutions are designed to specifically meet the needs of millennials, the  unbanked  (those who
have no formal relationship with a bank or credit union, prefer not to use a traditional checking account, or who do not meet
the minimum balance required to avoid high bank fees) and the  under-banked  (those who have only a minimal relationship
with a bank or credit union). These solutions provide end-users with convenient and secure anywhere and anytime mobile access
via the Internet to a variety of convenient self-service mobile banking services through an easy-to-use integrated mobile application
with multiple features downloaded onto their smart phone or tablet and linked to a reloadable prepaid card. Both our white label
and our SMM-X prepaid mobile money solutions support advanced analytics, which we believe can help our clients gain a competitive
advantage by enhancing the prepaid cardholder experience and keeping their customers engaged. As a result, we are experiencing
a growing demand for these solutions by financial institutions and AFS providers.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our business has historically focused on RDC solutions that enable financial institutions to provide their
customers with the ability to conveniently deposit their checks remotely anytime, anywhere. While we continue to offer these solutions,
we recently expanded our focus to include prepaid mobile money solutions. Our latest innovations are a mobile remote payment capture
solution, which we call Select Mobile  NowPay, which enables enterprises to accept check payments submitted via their customers 
mobile devices, and our mobile account opening solution, which we call Select Mobile  Account Opening, which streamlines
the account opening process by utilizing photo imaging to capture customer data and auto-populate an account opening application
form for checking, savings, credit card and other types of accounts.

    product.   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a total of 12 and nine clients who deployed our white label Select Mobile
Money solutions for use by their customers, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we entered into contracts for the sale of
a total of five SMM-X solutions, which has not yet been implemented by our clients. However, we believe our SMM-X solution has
the potential to significantly increase our future revenues as our financial model for this solution is based principally on future
transaction and/or user fee components. As we begin to deploy these solutions for our clients, and as their customers in turn
utilize this application, we believe that the potential recurring revenue from transaction and/or user fee components will become
a significant source of revenue for us, and our Select Mobile Money solutions could potentially become the primary source of our
future revenue.  

Revenues   

Our
revenues are comprised of non-recurring revenue and recurring revenue.  

Non-recurring
revenue consists of up-front implementation fees and fees from professional services. Up-front implementation fees are due upon
entering into a new contract for the initial setup of our solution. Fees from professional services may include fees charged for
any client customization services, development of interfaces requested by our clients, assistance with integration of our solutions
with our clients  applications, dedicated client support services, advisory services to clients who choose to develop their
own interfaces and applications, and additional marketing support services requested by our clients. For our RDC solutions, we
also include in this category revenues from the sale of scanning and related equipment.  

We
earn recurring revenue on a monthly basis from our clients  customer transactions, monthly user fees charged per customer,
and/or hosting/maintenance fees charged to our clients. Recurring revenues arise only after the client has implemented one of
our solutions, whether prepaid mobile money, RDC, or mobile account opening. Recurring revenue varies depending on the specific
solution deployed, the fee arrangement negotiated with the client, the number of client customers that use the application, the
type of user transaction and the volume of user transactions. Recurring revenue from our white label prepaid mobile money solutions
vary by client and typically comprise of a monthly hosting fee and a monthly active user fee charged based on the number of customers
that open the application. Although we do not currently charge user transaction fees for this solution, in the future we may introduce
new features into this solution which may have a transaction fee revenue component. Recurring revenue from our RDC solutions vary
by client and typically comprise of a monthly hosting/maintenance fee, a monthly user fee we charge our client for each customer
that has signed up for this service, and transaction fees which vary based on the type of service and the number of checks deposited
using this service. Recurring revenue from our Select Mobile NowPay solutions are expected to comprise of a monthly hosting fee
and transaction fees based on the number of payments received using this service. Recurring revenue from our Select Mobile Account
Opening solutions is expected to comprise of a monthly hosting fee and transaction fees based on the number of new accounts applications
made using this service.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Set
forth below is a summary of the critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
generate revenue from the following sources:  

up-front
    implementation fee;   

professional
    service fees; and   

recurring
    revenue, comprising of monthly hosting/maintenance fee, monthly user fees and transaction fees.   

We
commence revenue recognition for fees earned on our SaaS fintech solutions and services when all of the following criteria are
met:  

there
    is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;   

the
    service has been or is being provided to the client;   

collection
    of the fees is reasonably assured; and   

the
    amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable.   

Up-Front
Implementation Fees   

The
up-front implementation fees are recognized over the term of the contract or expected life of the contract where no contractual
term exists. Generally, client agreements are entered into for 12 to 36 months. A majority of the implementation service component
of the arrangement with clients is performed within 120 days of entering into a contract with the customer.  

Professional
Services Fee   

Fees
from professional services may include fees charged for any client customization services, development of interfaces requested
by our clients, assistance with integration of our solutions with our client s applications, dedicated client support services,
advisory services to clients who choose to develop their own interfaces and applications, and additional marketing support services
requested by our clients. Professional services are typically performed within three to six months of entering into an arrangement
with the customer. Professional services are typically sold on a fixed-fee basis, but are also offered on a time-and-material
basis. Revenue for time-and-material arrangements is recognized as the services are performed. Revenue for professional services
is recognized under a percent of completion method matching the revenue with the costs of the computer programmer s time.
We use internal milestones to estimate the costs and related percent of completion. Professional services are not considered essential
to the functionality of our SaaS solutions. For our RDC solutions, we also include in this category revenues from the sale of
scanning and related equipment.  

In
determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from other services, we consider the availability of
the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and whether we sell our solutions to new
clients without professional services.  

Recurring
Revenue   

Recurring
revenue is billed on a monthly basis, and comprises hosting/maintenance fees charged to our clients, user fees charged per customer,
and transaction fees based on our client s customer transactions. Recurring revenue arises only after the client has implemented
one of our solutions, whether RDC, Select Mobile Money, Select Mobile NowPay or Select Mobile Account Opening. Recurring revenue
varies depending on the specific solution deployed, the fee arrangement negotiated with the client, the number of client customers
that use the application (and, in the case of our prepaid mobile money application, the type of service used), and the volume
of monthly user transactions.  

Recurring
revenue is recognized monthly based on the terms of the specific client agreement, commencing on the date the service is provisioned
to the client, provided the four revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Hosting/maintenance fees and user fees are
recognized on a monthly basis as earned under the terms of the client agreement provided the four revenue recognition criteria
have been satisfied. Transaction volume fees are recognized as transactions are processed provided the four revenue recognition
criteria have been satisfied.  

Multiple
Element Arrangement   

We
enter into multiple element arrangements in which a client may purchase a solution and professional services. For arrangements
with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order
to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone
value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue
is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone
value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement
and treated as a single unit of accounting.

  MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

We
determine the selling price for each element based on the selling price hierarchy of: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value, or VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, and (iii) estimated selling price, or ESP. We are unable to establish
VSOE for any of our services, as we have not historically priced our solutions or services with sufficient consistency. We are
unable to establish TPE, as we do not have sufficient information regarding pricing of third-party solutions and professional
services similar to our offerings. As a result, we have developed estimates of selling prices based on margins established by
our senior management as the targets in our selling and pricing strategies after considering the nature of the services, the economic
and competitive environment, and the nature and magnitude of the costs incurred. The amount of arrangement fee allocated to a
single unit of accounting is limited by any contingent revenue, if applicable.  

Cost
of Revenue   

Cost
of revenue primarily consists of costs related to developing, implementing, hosting and supporting our cloud-based solutions and
services, including our RDC solutions and our prepaid mobile money solutions, providing client support, data communications expense,
salaries and benefits and non-cash stock compensation expense of operations and support personnel, software development fees,
software license fees, amortization expense associated with acquired developed technology assets, and property and equipment depreciation
of fixed assets used in the generation of revenue. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of professional services we procure
externally, including for the services we procure from our external programming consultants in Toronto, Canada. These external
programming consultants are dedicated primarily to our prepaid mobile money solutions and other select development projects. We
do not track or allocate cost of revenues to the different solutions or services we sell or to our specific revenue sources, except
for the cost of professional services we incur externally including for the services we procure from our external programming
consultants in Toronto, Canada.  

Deferred
Revenue   

Deferred
revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition from any of the solutions and services we
offer and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We typically invoice our clients monthly and, in certain
limited cases, on an annual basis. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of our
multi-year client agreements. Deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees, which are recognized
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The portion of deferred revenue we expect to recognize during the succeeding
12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current.  

Goodwill   

Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the appraised value of the portion of identifiable assets acquired in a previous acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or between annual dates if a change in circumstances
indicates that an impairment could exist. Our management performs its annual impairment test at the close of each fiscal year,
and considers several factors in evaluating goodwill for impairment, including our current financial position and results, general
economic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory conditions.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets, Including License Agreements   

We
review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of
the assets. In determining any impairment losses, we review all circumstances, including the undiscounted cash flows expected
to be derived from those contracts going forward.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, 
which requires that most equity instruments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net
income. The pronouncement also impacts the financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for financial instruments. The ASU does not apply to equity method investments or investments in consolidated subsidiaries.
The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and amendments to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet in
the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Leases,  which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed
purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest
method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months, regardless of their classification. Leases with
a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new standard supersedes
the previous leasing standard. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated
financial statements and disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU affects
entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting
for share-based payment award transactions, which include the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. The revised guidance is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. We are currently
evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses,  which introduces new guidance
for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on CECL on
certain types of financial instruments and expands disclosure requirements regarding an entities assumptions, models and methods
for estimating CECL. Generally, the CECL and subsequent changes to the estimate will be reported in current earnings through an
allowance on the consolidated balance sheets. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows,   which is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the consolidated statements of cash
flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including for interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption
is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Revenues   

Total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by approximately 124%, or $1.3 million, to $2.3 million, when
compared to $1.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in recurring revenue
from our RDC solutions, which increased by approximately 75%, or approximately $521,000, from approximately $697,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in
the number of our RDC products (including product enhancements) that were deployed by our clients for use by their customers from
41 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 55 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately
34%, and an increase in RDC transactions processed, which increased by approximately 52% from the third quarter of the prior year.
Recurring revenue from our white label Select Mobile Money solutions increased by approximately 85%, or approximately $46,000,
from approximately $54,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $100,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and recurring revenues from our Select Mobile Account Opening solution increased approximately 83%, or 79,000,
from approximately $96,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $175,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Revenue
from professional services increased by approximately 1051%, or approximately $537,000, from approximately $51,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $588,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and revenue from up-front
implementation fees increased by approximately 71%, or approximately $93,000, from approximately $132,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $225,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenue from
professional services is primarily attributable to our new customers requesting more customization. The increase in up-front implementation
fees is primarily due to the new implementation fees being amortized into revenue and the acceleration of previously deferred
revenue recognized as a result of the implementation of an upgraded product for certain of our customers, partially offset by
the completion of the amortization into revenue of historical implementation fees received in respect of products sold in prior
periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we sold approximately 102 RDC and white label Select Mobile Money products
(including product enhancements), as compared to approximately 47 products sold during the third quarter of 2015.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016:  

Approximately
    65% of our total revenue was generated from recurring revenue, which are revenues from our client s customer transactions,
    monthly user fees charged per customer, and hosting/maintenance fees charged to our clients, as compared to approximately
    82% during the same period in the prior year;   

Approximately
    25% of our total revenue represents revenue from professional services, primarily related to customization development work
    performed as part of implementing relating to our RDC and Select Mobile Money solutions, as compared to approximately 5% during
    the same period in the prior year; and,   

approximately
    10% of our total revenue represents up-front implementation fees, as compared to approximately 13% during the same period
    in the prior year.   

Cost
of Revenues   

Cost
of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.3 million, an increase of approximately 41%, or $389,000, compared
to approximately $945,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included in cost
of revenues was approximately $14,000 and $17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding
non-cash stock compensation expense, total cost of revenues increased approximately $392,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. Cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of our costs of deploying and supporting
our RDC solutions, and to a more limited extent the cost of deploying and supporting our white label Select Mobile Money solutions.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a decrease in amortization expense of approximately $30,000, due to
the impairment in 2015 of identified intangible assets from a previous acquisition. In addition, during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we experienced an increase in the external cost of providing professional services of approximately $110,000,
or 202%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This external cost of providing professional services are primarily
for the cost of services we procure from our external programming consultants in Toronto, Canada, who are dedicated primarily
to our prepaid mobile money solutions and other select development projects. We utilized these consultants more often during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
balance of approximately $312,000 of the increase in cost of revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016, after
taking into account the decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense included in cost of revenues of approximately $3,000,
the decrease in amortization expense of approximately $30,000 and the increase in the external cost of providing professional
services of approximately $110,000 discussed above, was primarily due to an increase in the third party licensing costs of approximately
$227,000 and approximately $85,000 of data center support costs, each related to an increase in recurring revenue from our RDC
solutions and our white label Select Mobile Money solutions.  

CACHET
FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS, INC.   

  MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Our
overall support costs for our data center, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was approximately $695,000, compared to approximately $610,000 for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of total
revenue, the data center costs were approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2016, compared to approximately 59% in the third
quarter of 2015. As our revenues increase, we are experiencing economies of scale related to our data center costs.  

As
a result of our investment in fixed costs to support current and expected future operations, and the relatively early stage of
recurring revenue generation across all product lines, the reported gross profit may not be representative of our operating model
as the volume of transactions increases in the future. The variable component of our cost of revenue is expected to increase as
transaction volume increases. We also expect to continue to gain leverage on the fixed portion of our cost of operations as more
clients are brought online and generating revenue.  

Operating
Expenses   

Our
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Our total
operating expenses increased by approximately 19%, or $427,000 to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
from $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 is attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses of approximately
$280,000 and $156,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses of approximately $9,000,
respectively.  

Sales
and Marketing   

Total
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 38%, or $280,000, to approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, from approximately $734,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense
included in sales and marketing expenses was approximately $47,000 and $27,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, total sales and marketing expenses increased approximately
$260,000 for the third quarter of 2016.  

The
overall increase in sales and marketing expenses (excluding non-cash compensation expense) was primarily due to hiring pursuant
to our efforts to build a robust national sales force. We currently anticipate our sales and marketing expenses will continue
to increase for 2016 compared to 2015 as we plan to hire additional sales associates during the remainder 2016, in an effort to
increase our sales efforts for all of our solutions and services. We may also experience increased sales and marketing expenses
as a result of higher levels of commission expense resulting from increased sales.  

Research
and Development   

Total
research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 2%, or $9,000, to approximately
$479,000 from approximately $488,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included
in research and development expenses was approximately $12,000 and $24,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

We
believe our research and development expenses will decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015, because we have completed most of our research and development work on our prepaid mobile money solutions,
and we anticipate that our other projects under development, Select Mobile Account Opening and Select Mobile NowPay, will require
less research and development.  

General
and Administrative   

Total
general and administrative expenses increased approximately 15%, or $156,000, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, from $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included in general
and administrative expenses was approximately $94,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately
$80,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Excluding
the $14,000 increase in non-cash stock compensation expenses, we experienced an increase in employee and non-employee cash compensation
expense of approximately $53,000 and recruiting fees of approximately $62,000 due to increased hiring of employees and contract
labor within the finance department and other administrative positions. We also experienced a net increase of $26,000 in facilities,
travel, equipment and miscellaneous expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015.  

We
believe our general and administrative costs will increase slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Interest
Expense and Non-Cash Financing Charges   

Interest
expense and other non-cash financing expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $2.5 million compared to approximately
$168,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.3 million. The expenses in the third quarter of 2016 include
approximately $136,000 of cash interest expense related to the outstanding debt and capital lease obligations, approximately $656,000
of amortization of deferred financing fees and original issue discount, and $1.7 million related to issuing additional warrants
for short-term debt obligations. The expenses in the third quarter of 2015 included approximately $128,000 of cash interest expense
and approximately $40,000 of amortization of deferred financing fees.  

Mark-to-Market
Warrant and Debt (Income) Expense   

Mark-to-market
warrant and debt income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $108,000, which was primarily due
to a decrease in our share price as of September 30, 2016 compared with June 30, 2016. The liability associated with the outstanding
warrants and convertible notes was adjusted to fair value as of September 30, 2016 using the closing price of our common stock
as of that date, which is a significant input to the determination of fair value. Mark-to-market warrant expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 was $4.6 million, which was primarily due to a large increase in our share price as of September
30, 2015 as compared to June 30, 2015. The number of outstanding warrants with anti-dilutive protection was 1,262,407 as
of September 30, 2016 compared to 1,115,298 as of September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized other income of approximately $33,000 arising from insurance proceeds
received as reimbursement for litigation expenses incurred in connection with the Cachet Banq litigation.

revenue from our RDC solutions, which increased by approximately 74%, or $1.5 million, from $2.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of
our RDC products (including product enhancements) that were deployed by our clients for use by their customers from 94 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 147 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately

in amortization expense of approximately $90,000 and the increase in the external cost of providing professional services of approximately
$231,000 discussed above, was primarily due to an increase in the third party licensing costs of approximately $662,000 and approximately
$272,000 of data center support costs related to an increase in recurring revenue from our RDC solutions and our white label Select
Mobile Money solutions.  

Our
overall support costs for our data center, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $2.1 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of total revenue, the data center
costs were approximately 36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 60% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. As our revenues increase, we are experiencing economies of scale related to our data center costs.  

As
a result of our investment in fixed costs to support current and expected future operations, and the relatively early stage of
recurring revenue generation across all product lines, the reported gross profit may not be representative of our operating model
as the volume of transactions increases in the future. The variable component of our cost of revenue is expected to increase as
transaction volume increases. We also expect to continue to gain leverage on the fixed portion of our cost of operations as more
clients are brought online and generating revenue.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Operating
Expenses   

Our
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Our total
operating expenses increased by approximately 1%, or $98,000 to $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
$7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 is attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses of approximately
$613,000 and $212,000, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses of approximately $727,000.  

Sales
and Marketing   

Total
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 25% or $612,000 to $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
from $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included in sales and marketing
expenses was approximately $130,000 and $58,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding
non-cash stock compensation expense, total sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $541,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

The
overall increase in sales and marketing expenses (excluding non-cash compensation expense) was primarily due to hiring pursuant
to our efforts to build a robust national sales force. We currently anticipate our sales and marketing expenses will continue
to increase for 2016 compared to 2015 as we plan to hire additional sales associates during the remainder 2016, in an effort to
increase our sales efforts for all of our solutions and services. We may also experience increased sales and marketing expenses
as a result of higher levels of commission expense resulting from increased sales.  

Research
and Development   

Total
research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 34%, or $727,000, to $1.4
million, from $2.1 million or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included in research
and development expenses was approximately $86,000 and $63,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Excluding the increase in non-cash stock compensation expense attributable to research and development, gross research and development
expenses decreased by approximately $750,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the same period of 2015.  

The
decrease research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to both a decrease in
the number of our associates involved in research and development following the completion of development and release of our Select
Business Merchant Capture platform, an RDC solution designed specifically for businesses, and a switch from external programming
consultants to employee software developers. Excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, our employee compensation, contractor
costs and related expenses decreased by approximately $482,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, recruiting expenses decreased approximately $179,000 and travel, facilities,
software and other miscellaneous expenses decreased by approximately $89,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

We
believe our research and development expenses will decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015, because we have completed most of our research and development work on our prepaid mobile money solutions,
and we anticipate that our other projects under development, Select Mobile Account Opening and Select Mobile NowPay, will require
less research and development.  

General
and Administrative   

Total
general and administrative expenses increased approximately 7%, or $212,000, to $3.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, from $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash stock compensation expense included in general
and administrative expenses was approximately $172,000 and $148,000, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.  

Excluding
the $24,000 increase in non-cash stock compensation expenses, we experienced a net increase in employee and non-employee cash
compensation expense of approximately $83,000 and recruiting fees of approximately $134,000 due to increased hiring of employees
and contract labor within the finance department and other administrative positions. We also experienced a net decrease of approximately
$28,000 in facilities, travel, equipment and miscellaneous expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

We
believe our general and administrative costs will increase slightly in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Interest
Expense and Non-Cash Financing Charges   

Interest
expense and other non-cash financing expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.7 million compared to $1.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.0 million. These expenses include approximately $403,000 of cash
interest expense related to the outstanding debt and capital lease obligations, approximately $853,000 of amortization of deferred
financing fees and original issue discount, and $3.4 million related to issuing additional warrants for short term debt obligations.
The expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $394,000 of cash interest expense, approximately
$193,000 of amortization of deferred financing fees and $1.1 million of expenses related to the issuance of warrants as part of
a private investment in public equity ( PIPE ) offering.  

Share
Price Conversion Adjustment   

There
was no share price conversion adjustment related to convertible securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. However,
there was a share price conversion adjustment of $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 arising from the adjustment
of adjusting conversion prices on our series A, B and C preferred stock.  

Mark-to-Market
Warrant and Debt Expense   

Mark-to-market
warrant and debt expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
The liability associated with the outstanding warrants and convertible notes issued was adjusted to fair value as of September
30, 2016 using the closing price of our common stock as of that date, which is a significant input to the determination of fair
value. The number of outstanding warrants with anti-dilutive protection was 1,262,407 as of September 30, 2016 compared to
1,115,298 as of September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized other income of approximately $325,000 arising from insurance proceeds
received as reimbursement for litigation expenses incurred in connection with the Cachet Banq litigation. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we recognized other expense of approximately $14,000 for finance costs related to an advisory fee from
a financial advisory services company.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Financial
Condition   

Since
our inception in February 2010, we have raised capital to support operating losses incurred in development of our solutions, products
and services, our capability infrastructure, the marketing expenses to increase our client base and the general and administrative
functions to support our planned growth. Our accumulated deficit from inception through September 30, 2016 of $81.5 million has
been funded primarily through the issuance of equity, debt, and warrants.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had approximately $51,000 and $45,000, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents.
In the normal course of business, our principal demands for funds are to pay or fund operating expenses as well as principal and
interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, including capital leases. The majority of our notes payable are due within
one year. We have two notes payable that mature in December 2016 for $4.3 million, in the aggregate, which includes principal,
original issue discount and estimated interest through the maturity dates of the notes. We expect to be able to repay these notes
using proceeds from our ongoing October Private Placement. We have recorded approximately $2.8 million in notes payable that are
due in 2017, the majority of which will convert to equity upon consummation of an underwritten public offering. If we are unsuccessful
in consummating an underwritten public offering, we will have to raise additional funds through other sources in order to repay
this debt.  

Going
Concern   

As
reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash in operations
of $6.4 million and had a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $12.5 million. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, as expressed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial
statements. Historically, we have demonstrated an ability to raise funds to support our business operations. We believe,
based on our current cash flow forecast, we have enough cash to continue operations through December 31, 2016 and beyond. This
forecast is dependent upon successful completion of the October Private Placement.  If we do not successfully complete the
October Private Placement, we may not be able to continue operations.

On
October 12, 2015, we entered into a $10,000,000 equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC. On July 1, 2016

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Our
accounts receivable increased by $1.6 million and approximately $249,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The significant increases in accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was due
to an overall increase in our revenues and billings. Changes in working capital also included an increase in deferred commissions
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $11,000 and $24,000, respectively, as a result of an
overall increase in our revenues during these periods and the commissions we paid to our sales staff. Prepaid expenses increased
$1.3 million for the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to prepaid offering costs and purchases of prepaid software licenses
and decreased approximately $131,000 during the first nine months of 2015 as a result of expensing annual software and hardware
support contracts over the period the services are provided and the amortization of prepaid software licenses. Our deferred revenue
balance decreased by approximately $441,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with an increase of approximately
$291,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease primarily related
to the amortization into revenue amounts due under long-term contracts while the increase for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 primarily related to billings received in advance of revenue recognition criteria being met.  

Our
accounts payable balance increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by $1.0 million, compared to an increase of
approximately $494,000 when compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in accounts payable
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to purchases of software licenses and amounts incurred for offering costs.
The primary reason for the increase in accounts payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was that we incurred significant
fees related to completing our equity offerings and other professional fees associated with completing our year-end audit. Accrued
expenses increased during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 by approximately $137,000 and $82,000, respectively, primarily
as a result of an increase in accruals for various related operating costs incurred but unpaid at the end of both periods presented.
Accrued interest expense increased during the first nine months of 2016 by approximately $348,000 compared to $195,000 for the
same period in the prior year. The increase in accrued interest for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to
an increase in our outstanding indebtedness.  

Investing
Activities   

Cash
used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $36,000 and $78,000,
respectively. These purchases were primarily part of hardware and software upgrades to our data centers where we host our SaaS
cloud based platforms for our clients and computers for our employees. Based on future growth, we may be required to make additional
investments in our data centers.  

Financing
Activities   

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.5 million compared to $5.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Excluding
approximately $180,000 of debt issuance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our borrowings during the first
nine months of 2016 and 2015 totaled $5.2 million and approximately $750,000, respectively. The funds received during the first
nine months of 2016 came from Messrs. Hanson and Davis as well as several other investors, while funds received during the first
nine months of 2015 came from Messrs. Hanson and Davis. The funds were primarily used for working capital and debt service purposes
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and working capital purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We
repaid $1.1 million on notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and approximately $157,000 in principal payments
related to installments payments on an outstanding note payable during the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we made principal payments on capital leases totaling approximately $291,000 and $116,000, respectively. We
also borrowed approximately $69,000 and $113,000 on a bank loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
while making principal payments against bank loans totaling approximately $70,000 and $79,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During
the first nine months of 2016, we issued shares of our common stock and issued five-year warrants to purchase shares of our common
stock in a private placement. Net proceeds to us after offering costs were $1.2 million. During the first nine months of 2016,
we also received $1.6 million pursuant to the exercise of warrants. We received $5.2 million pursuant to sales of Series C Preferred
Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

CONTINGENCIES   

We

uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect,
it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES   

On
March 31, 2016, the holder of our series subordinated note, referred to in Note 4  Financing Arrangements  of the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, commenced an action against us in Hennepin County Court in the State
of Minnesota alleging we breached the terms of the note. The lawsuit alleges that we owe the note holder $694,869 plus interest
and assessments accruing after April 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had recorded approximately $415,000 of outstanding
debt and approximately $39,000 of accrued interest related to this matter. We dispute the allegations of the note holder. This alleged default could subject us to claims of
default or cross default by our other lenders. At this time, no other lender has asserted such a claim.  

On
or about May 24, 2016, we received notice from Trooien Capital alleging that we have not made interest payments in accordance
with the terms of the loan and security agreement entered into by our Subsidiary and Trooien Capital on December 12, 2013 and
that, as a result of such alleged breach, all outstanding amounts under that agreement are accelerated. As of September 30, 2016,
we had recorded $2.3 million of outstanding debt and approximately $543,000 of accrued interest related to this matter. We dispute
Trooien Capital s claim, have submitted an answer to the claim and further counterclaims, and intend to vigorously defend
the claim.

2014 Stock Incentive Plan  

On February
12, 2014, we adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. The plan is administered by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee.
Our Chief Executive Officer may, on a discretionary basis and without committee review or approval, grant non-qualified (non-statutory)
options for up to 6,667 common shares to new employees of the Company who are not officers of the Company during each fiscal year.
Incentives under the plan may be granted in one or a combination of the following forms: (a) non-statutory
stock options; (b) stock appreciation rights; (c) stock awards; (d) restricted stock; (e) restricted stock units; and (f) performance
shares. Eligible participants include officers and employees of the company, members of the Board of Directors, and consultants
or other independent contractors. An aggregate of 101,442 shares of common stock are issuable under the plan. No person is eligible
to receive grants of stock options and SARs under the plan that exceed, in the aggregate, 26,667 shares of common stock in any
one year. The term of each stock option shall be determined by the board or committee, but shall not exceed ten years. Vested
stock options may be exercised in whole or part by the holder giving notice to the Company. Options under the plan may provide
for the holder of the option to make payment of the exercise price by the surrender of shares equal in value to the exercise price.
