STATEMENTS 

1.          
 ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING
CONCERN 

FluoroPharma Medical, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the
 Company ), is a molecular imaging company
headquartered in Montclair, N.J. The Company was founded as
FluoroPharma Inc. in 2003 to engage in the discovery, development
and commercialization of proprietary products for the positron
emission tomography ( PET ) market. The Company s
initial focus has been on the development of novel cardiovascular
imaging agents that can more efficiently and effectively detect and
assess acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease
( CAD ). Molecular imaging pharmaceuticals are
radiopharmaceuticals that enable early detection of disease through
the visualization of subtle changes in biochemical and biological
processes. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, FluoroPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation. All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. and subsidiary have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include all information and footnotes required by
U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.  In the
opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments,
consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, considered
necessary for a fair presentation.  Interim operating results
are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for
the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other interim
period.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements of the Company and the notes thereto as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015, as included in the Company's
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Going concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since its inception.  The Company has
sustained cumulative losses attributable to common stockholders of
$34,925,477 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company has
historically financed its operations through issuances of equity
and the proceeds of debt instruments. In the past, the Company has
also provided for its cash needs by issuing common stock, options
and warrants for certain operating costs, including consulting and
professional fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company raised net cash proceeds of $501,830 through the
issuance of notes payable.  During the year ended
December 31, 2015, the Company raised net cash proceeds of
$2,686,315 through the issuance of notes payable. In addition,
during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received gross
proceeds of $35,970 from the sale of freely tradable securities
received as consideration for the issuance of promissory
notes.  

The Company continues to actively pursue various funding options,
including equity offerings, to obtain additional funds to continue
the development of its products and bring them to commercial
markets. Management continues to assess fund raising opportunities
to ensure minimal dilution to its existing shareholder base and to
obtain the best price for its securities. Management is optimistic
based upon its ability to raise funds in prior years, through
private placement offerings, that it will be able to raise
additional funds in the future.  If the Company is unable to
raise additional capital as may be needed to meet its projections
for operating expenses, it could have a material adverse effect on
liquidity or require the Company to cease or significantly delay
some of its clinical trials.  These financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of
recorded asset amounts that might be necessary as a result of the
above uncertainty.

 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Intangible Assets 

The Company s intangible assets consist of technology
licenses and are carried at the legal cost to obtain them.
Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life. Useful lives on technology licenses are
5 to 15 years. 

Impairments 

The Company assesses the impairment of its intangible assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC Topic
360-10-35,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.  The determination of related estimated useful lives
and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant
judgments, related primarily to the future profitability and/or
future value of the assets. The Company records an impairment
charge if it believes an investment has experienced a decline in
value that is other than temporary. 

Management has determined that no impairments were required as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company has various financial instruments that must be measured
at fair value on a recurring basis, including certain marketable
securities and derivatives. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets and
liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but
are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain
circumstances.  During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company valued the Amended 2014 Notes (see Note 4) at
fair value in connection with a modification in terms that was
accounted for as a Debt Extinguishment. The Amended 2014 Notes were
recorded at fair value on the date of the modification and are not
subsequently adjusted to fair value. 

The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair
value, in three levels based on the markets in which the assets and
liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used
to determine fair value.  Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (an exit price). 

Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices
or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices
generally will have a higher degree of market price observability
and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair
value. 

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows: 

Level
1   Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.  Valuations are obtained
from readily available pricing sources for market transactions
involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2   Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level
1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level
3   Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3
assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is
determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for
which the determination of fair value requires significant
management judgment or estimation. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall
into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In
such cases, an instrument s level within the fair value
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.  The Company s
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers
factors specific to the financial instrument.

The Company recognizes transfers between levels at the end of the
reporting period as if the transfers occurred on the last day of
the reporting period. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
at September 30, 2016 are summarized below: 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
at December 31, 2015 are summarized below: 

The following table sets forth the changes in the estimated fair
value for our Level 3 classified derivative liability: 

Revenue Recognition 

From time to time the Company enters into licensing agreements, the
terms of which may include grants of licenses, or options to obtain
licenses, to our intellectual property and research and development
activities. Payments under these arrangements typically include one
or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees;
funding of research and/or development efforts; amounts due upon
the achievement of specified objectives; and/or royalties on future
product sales. 

The Company recognizes milestone payments as revenue in their
entirety upon the achievement of a substantive milestone if the
consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone (i) is
consistent with performance required to achieve the milestone or
the increase in value to the delivered item, (ii) relates solely to
past performance and (iii) is reasonable relative to all of the
other deliverables and payments within the arrangement. 
Amounts received contractually designated to fund further research
are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses
when the Company has satisfied all performance obligations to the
licensee and expenses for specified development activities have
been incurred.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern.  The core principle of the guidance is that an
entity s management should evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are available to be issued. When management identifies
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an
entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management
should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate
those relevant conditions or events that will alleviate the
substantial doubt are adequately disclosed in the footnotes to the
financial statements. This guidance will be effective for the
annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter. 

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ) which requires
that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as
noncurrent on the balance sheet.  The current requirement that
deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an
entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected
by this guidance.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 but early
application is permitted and the guidance may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or
retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this
ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
 FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2015-03, 'Interest - Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs . ASU 2015-03 is intended to simplify the presentation
of debt issuance costs. These amendments require that debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The
recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are
not affected by the amendments in this ASU. This new guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2015.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016
and applied the standard retrospectively. 

In January 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-01  Income Statement -
Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of
Extraordinary Items . This ASU removes the concept of an
extraordinary item.  Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement -
Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately
classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and
transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be
an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless
evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary
item.  If an event or transaction meets the criteria for
extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate
the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and
show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after
income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to
disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose
earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. 
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015.  The Company adopted this standard on January
1, 2016.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a
material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases , which requires a lessee to recognize lease
liabilities for the lessee s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and
right-of-use assets, representing the lessee s right to use,
or control the use of, specified assets for the lease
term.  Additionally, the new guidance has simplified
accounting for sale and leaseback transactions.  Lessor
accounting is largely unchanged.  The ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018.  Early application is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on the
financial statements. 

F-7 

Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation . The areas for simplification in
this update involve several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For
public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in
any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the
amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be
reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all
of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on the financial
statements. 

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230  ) ,   a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues
Task Force. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in
practice in how certain transactions are classified in the
statement of cash flows.     For public business entities, the standard is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted,
provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.
The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition
method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this ASU on the financial statements.

NOTES PAYABLE 

2014 Convertible Notes Payable 

During 2014 and 2015, the Company issued promissory notes (the
 2014 Notes ) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement
entered into with certain accredited investors for an aggregate
principal amount of $2,198,416. The 2014 Notes mature one year from
the date of issuance and bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum.
All principal and accrued interest under the 2014 Notes will
automatically convert into the Company s next equity or
equity-linked financing (a  Subsequent Financing )
in accordance with the following formula: (outstanding balance of
the Notes as of the closing of the Subsequent Financing) x (1.15) /
(the per security price of the securities sold in the Subsequent
Financing).  The investors shall be considered to be
purchasers in the Subsequent Financing by way of their converted
2014 Notes.  In addition, upon the closing of a
Subsequent Financing, each of the investors shall be issued, in
addition to any warrants issued in connection with a Subsequent
Financing, an additional warrant to purchase a number of shares of
common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares
of common stock purchased by such investor in the Subsequent
Financing assuming a per share purchase price of the securities to
be issued in the Subsequent Financing. 

In May 2015, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible
Notes (as defined and discussed below), the holders of the 2014
Notes, in the outstanding principal amount of $2,198,416, amended
their 2014 Notes to (i) extend the maturity date an additional six
months, (ii) change the terms of the conversion premium from 1.15
to 1.25 to be consistent with conversion terms of the Convertible
Notes, and (iii) provide that the issuance of promissory notes
by the Company in a transaction with a substantially similar
structure to the transactions contemplated by the 2014 Notes shall
not be deemed a Subsequent Financing. 

On January 20, 2016, the Company further amended  the
2014 Notes (the  Amended 2014 Notes ),  in
order to  (i) extend the maturity date for an additional
six months,  (ii) retroactively increase the interest
rate to 12%, (iii) provide the ability to voluntary convert the
notes, including principal and interest multiplied by 1.25, at a
conversion price of $0.35 per share (which results in an effective
conversion price of $0.28 per share), (iv) provide resale
registration rights, and (v) provide  full-ratchet 
anti-dilutive protection. As a result of this amendment, the
conversion price of each of the Company's existing Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, the Convertible Notes
and certain related warrants, has been adjusted to $0.28 per
share. 

The Company applied guidance in FASB ASC 470-50,  Debt
Modifications and Extinguishments,  (ASC 470-50) and
determined that the amendment qualified as a debt extinguishment
(the  Debt Extinguishment ). This determination was
made after calculating that the newly amended terms increased
the fair value of the embedded conversion feature in excess of
10 percent. 

In order to account for the Debt Extinguishment, the Company
recorded the Amended 2014 Notes and the embedded conversion feature
at their then fair values of $2,495,582 and $945,951,
respectively.  The embedded conversion feature was
recorded as a derivative liability after determining the
requirements for equity classification, in accordance with ASC
Topic 815-40, were not met.  The difference between the
carrying value of the 2014 Notes, including all principal, accrued
interest and deferred financing costs and the fair value of the
Amended 2014 Notes and embedded conversion feature was recorded as
a loss on debt extinguishment of $1,022,520 in the statement of
operations.  The difference between the principal amount
of the Amended 2014 Notes and the fair value of the Amended 2014
Notes of $238,515 will be amortized to interest expense over the
term of the notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company amortized interest of $181,706 on the Amended 2014
Notes. 

On July
22, 2016, the Company entered into a further amendment to the 2014
Notes to extend the maturity date of the Notes for an additional
ninety days. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued
653,988 shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of
Amended 2014 Notes. The carrying value of the converted Amended
2014 Notes plus accreted interest was approximately $178,731 and
the fair value of the derivative related to the embedded conversion
feature was $15,271. The Company recorded a gain on extinguishment
related to these conversions totaling $26,785.

The derivative liability related to the embedded conversion feature
is being re-measured at each balance sheet date based on estimated
fair value, and any resultant changes in fair value is being
recorded in the Company s consolidated statement of
operations. 

Upon conversion, the notes and embedded derivatives are removed at
their carrying value, after a final mark-to-market of the embedded
derivative s fair value. Common stock issued upon conversion
is measured at its current fair value, with any difference recorded
as a gain or loss on extinguishment.

2015 Convertible Notes Payable 

On May 28, 2015, the Company accepted subscriptions pursuant to a
new Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, as amended on August 6,
2015, for the issuance and sale in a private placement of up to
$3,000,000 of convertible promissory notes (the  Convertible
Notes ).  The Convertible Notes mature one year
from the date of issuance and bear interest at the rate of 8% per
annum.  All principal and accrued interest under the
Convertible Notes will, at the sole option of the investor (i)
convert into the Company s next equity or equity-linked
financing in which the Company raises gross proceeds of at least
$3,600,000 (the  Subsequent Financing ), into such
securities, including warrants of the Company as are issued in the
Subsequent Financing, the amount of which shall be determined in
accordance with the following formula: (the outstanding balance of
the Convertible Notes plus accrued interest as of the closing of
the Subsequent Financing) x (1.25) / (the per security price of the
securities sold in the Subsequent Financing), or (ii) convert into
a new financing in which the Company shall issue to the investor
one share of common stock and one-half of one warrant at a purchase
price no greater than $0.35 per share. The per security price of
the securities sold in the Subsequent Financing shall not exceed
$0.35.  In addition, the holders of the Convertible Notes
shall have the option, at any time, to convert all principal and
accrued interest into common stock at price per share of
$0.35.   In the event that the Company shall, at any
time, issue or sell additional shares of common stock or common
stock equivalents, as defined, at a price per share less than
$0.35, then the conversion price of the Convertible Notes shall be
reduced to a price equal to the consideration paid for these
additional shares of common stock.  As a result of the
2016 amendment to the 2014 Notes, the conversion price of the
Convertible Notes was adjusted to $0.28 per share. 

Pursuant to the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, the Company
issued warrants at an initial exercise price per share of $0.50 to
purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to fifty percent
of the number of shares of common stock such investor would receive
upon full conversion of the Convertible Notes at a conversion price
of $0.35 per share.  As a result of the 2016 amendment to
the 2014 Notes, the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted to
$0.28 per share. 

From May through September 2015, the Company
issued Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$2,780,005 and warrants to purchase 3,971,436 shares of common
stock at $0.50 per share.  In connection with the
issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company paid to placement
agents a cash fee of $142,400 and issued 406,859 five-year warrants
to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50
per share.   On the issuance date, the fair
value of the placement agent warrants was $39,108 which was
recorded as a deferred offering cost and as a derivative warrant
liability.  

Based upon the Company s analysis of the criteria contained
in ASC Topic 815-40,  Derivatives and Hedging Contracts
in Entity s Own Equity  ( ASC Topic
815-40 ), the Company has determined that since the exercise
price of the warrants may be reduced if the Company issues shares
at a price below the then-current exercise price, the warrants
issued in connection with the Convertible Notes must be classified
as derivative instruments. In accordance with ASC Topic 815-40,
these warrants are also being re-measured at each balance sheet
date based on estimated fair value, and any resultant changes in
fair value is being recorded in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations. 

In order to account for the issuance of the Convertible Notes and
warrants, the Company allocated the total gross proceeds of
$2,780,005 between the Convertible Notes and the
warrants.  The warrants were allocated their full fair
value as of the respective grant dates totaling $358,255 and the
residual net proceeds of $2,421,750 were allocated to the
Convertible Notes.  The conversion feature of the
Convertible Notes was then analyzed.  The Company
determined that the embedded conversion feature did not meet the
requirements for equity classification in accordance with ASC Topic
815-40.  Therefore, the conversion feature fair value of
$490,340 was bifurcated from the host contract, the Convertible
Notes, and recorded as a derivative liability, thereby creating a
further discount on the Convertible Notes.  The
conversion feature is also being re-measured at each balance sheet
date based on estimated fair value, and any resultant changes in
fair value is being recorded in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations.

On May 26, 2016, the 2015 Notes were amended to (i) extend the
maturity date an additional six months and (ii) increase the
interest rate, from 8% to 12%, applied retroactively from the
initial issuance date of the Notes. The Company applied guidance in
ASC 470-50 and determined that the amendment did not qualify as a
debt extinguishment. This determination was made after
calculating that the present value of the cash flows under the
modified debt instrument is less than a 10 percent change from the
present value of the remaining cash flows under the original
debt. 

Lewis Opportunity Fund, an affiliate of W. Austin Lewis, IV, a
member of the Company s Board of Directors, participated as
an investor in the Convertible Notes in 2015 in an aggregate
principal amount of $2,000,000 and was issued warrants to purchase
an aggregate of 2,857,143 shares of common stock. 

2016 Convertible Notes Payable 

On March 23, 2016, the Company accepted subscriptions pursuant to a
new Note Purchase Agreement for the issuance and sale in a private
placement of an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,000,000 of
convertible promissory notes (the  2016 Convertible
Notes ), convertible into shares of common stock. The initial
closing of the private placement was consummated on March 23, 2016
for an aggregate amount of $150,000, which was invested by Dr.
Thomas H. Tulip, the Company s chief executive officer. The
Company may conduct any number of additional closings so long as
the final closing occurs on or before the 240th day following the
initial closing date. 

From April 26, 2016 through August 17, 2016, the Company issued
additional 2016 Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount
of $260,000. 

The 2016 Convertible Notes mature one year from the date of
issuance and bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum payable
upon the earlier of (i) exchange or voluntary conversion of the
2016 Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms thereof and
(ii) the maturity date. All principal and accrued interest under
the 2016 Convertible Notes (the  Outstanding Balance )
will automatically convert into the Company s next equity or
equity-linked financing (the  Subsequent Financing ),
without any action on the part of the investor, into such
securities, including warrants of the Company that are issued in
the Subsequent Financing, the amount of which shall be determined
in accordance with the following formula: (the Outstanding Balance
as of the closing of the Subsequent Financing) x (1.25) / (the per
security price of the securities sold in the Subsequent Financing).
For the purpose of calculating the formula above, the per security
price of the securities sold in the Subsequent Financing shall not
exceed $0.35. The issuance of promissory notes by the Company in a
transaction with a substantially similar structure to the 2016
Convertible Notes (as determined in good faith by the
Company s board of directors) shall not be deemed a
Subsequent Financing. 

Each investor also has the right, at its option at any time, to
convert the Outstanding Balance into shares of common stock as is
obtained by dividing (i) the Outstanding Balance to be converted
multiplied by 1.25, by (ii) a conversion price, $0.35 per share;
provided, however, if an event of default has occurred and is
continuing, the conversion price shall be adjusted to $0.15 per
share. The 2016 Convertible Notes are subject to customary
adjustments for issuances of shares of common stock as a dividend
or distribution on shares of the common stock, or mergers or
reorganizations, as well as  full-ratchet 
anti-dilution adjustments for future issuances of other Company
securities (subject to certain standard carve-outs). 

Upon the closing of a Subsequent Financing, each of the investors
shall be issued, in addition to any warrants issued in connection
with a Subsequent Financing, an additional warrant (the
 Additional Warrant ), to purchase a number of shares
of common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the number of
shares of common stock purchased by such investor in the Subsequent
Financing assuming a per share purchase price of the securities to
be issued in the Subsequent Financing. The terms of the Additional
Warrants shall be substantially identical to the terms of the
warrants issued in the Subsequent Financing, except the exercise
price per share of the Additional Warrants shall be equal to the
per share purchase price of the securities issued in the Subsequent
Financing. In the event no warrants are issued in the Subsequent
Financing, each of the investors shall nonetheless be entitled to
an Additional Warrant, which Additional Warrant shall be
non-callable, exercised on a cash only basis and have a term of
five (5) years following the closing date of the Subsequent
Financing. 

The conversion feature of the 2016 Convertible Notes was
analyzed.  The Company determined that the embedded
conversion feature did not meet the requirements for equity
classification in accordance with ASC Topic
815-40.  Therefore, the conversion feature with a fair
value of $83,343 was bifurcated from the host contract, the 2016
Convertible Notes, and recorded as a derivative liability, thereby
creating a discount on the 2016 Convertible Notes.  The
conversion feature is also being re-measured at each balance sheet
date based on estimated fair value, and any resultant changes in
fair value is being recorded in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations.

Table of Contents  

On July 22, 2016, the 2016 Convertible Notes were amended to change
the final closing date from 120 days to 240 days after the initial
closing of March 23, 2016. 

In connection with the issuance of the short-term financing notes
and the convertible notes in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company
incurred $344,296 in issuance costs.  These costs are
recorded as deferred issuance costs, which are offset against the
proceeds from the convertible notes on the Company s balance
sheet and amortized to interest expense over the term of such
convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company has amortized $104,641 and $95,208,
respectively, of issuance costs to expense.  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the
discount on the convertible notes of $448,071 and $125,448,
respectively. 

A reconciliation of the Company s Convertible Notes Payable
  Short Term, as of September 30, 2016, is as
follows: 

Interest expense, including accretion of the 2014 Amended Notes to
fair value, amortization of deferred issuance costs and debt
discounts related to the warrants and beneficial conversion
feature, totaled $1,065,514 and $398,775 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In connection with the private placement of the Convertible Notes,
the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the
investors, in which the Company agreed to file a registration
statement with the SEC to register for resale the shares underlying
the Convertible Notes and the warrants within 90 calendar days of
the final closing date of the Convertible Notes and to have
the registration statement declared effective within 120 calendar
days after the filing date. 

For embedded conversion features that are accounted for as a
derivative liability, the Company used a Binomial Options Pricing
model.  The primary assumptions used to determine the
fair values of these embedded conversion features were: risk free
interest rate with a range 0.35% - 1.14%, volatility of 68.09%, and
actual term of the related convertible notes. 

Other Notes Payable 

On
September 27, 2016, the Company borrowed $100,000 in the form of a
short term promissory note (the  Note ). The Note
matures on October 31, 2016 and bears interest at the rate of 5%
per annum if the Note is repaid on or prior to the maturity date
and 15% if the Note is not repaid by the maturity
date.

5.            LICENSE
AGREEMENT 

On June 3, 2016, the Company entered into two exclusive license
agreements (the  Licenses ) with Sinotau USA, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Hainan Sinotau Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
( Sinotau ), a pharmaceutical organization. Sinotau is
responsible for developing and commercializing the Company s
proprietary cardiac PET imaging assets, CardioPET and BFPET, in
China and Canada.  Sinotau also retains a first right of
refusal to license the technology for development in Australia and
Singapore. In accordance with the Licenses, the Company is
entitled to upfront payments of $550,000, milestone payments
totaling $1,450,000 upon the completion of certain development
activities and royalties on future sales made by
Sinotau. 

As of September 30, 2016, the transfer of technology specified in
the Sinotau agreement has not been completed and therefore a
portion of the upfront payment totaling $183,333 has been recorded
as deferred revenue. The remaining portion of the upfront payment,
totaling $366,667, is to be used in order to further fund the
Company s research and development activities and is included
in accrued expenses and other liabilities until such research and
development costs are incurred. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company has incurred $193,447 of research and development costs and
recorded these amounts as a reduction in research and development
expenses. The unused portion of funded research totaling $173,220
remains in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of September
30, 2016. 

License payments, excluding payments to fund further research, are
subject to the Company s license agreement with MGH (see Note
9). Upon receiving the upfront payment from Sinotau, the Company
recorded a royalty expense of $37,500, payable to MGH, within
research and development expenses.

8.             COMMON
STOCK OPTIONS 

On February 11, 2011, the Company adopted its 2011 Equity Incentive
Plan (the  Plan ) under which 6,475,750 shares of
common stock were reserved for issuance under options or other
equity interests as set forth in the Plan. Under the Plan, options
are available for issuance to employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisors. The Plan provides that the board of
directors will determine the exercise price and vesting terms of
each option on the date of grant. Options granted under the Plan
generally expire ten years from the date of grant. 

Under the Plan, the Company has issued 161,250 shares of fully paid
and non-assessable restricted common stock to a director of the
Company. These shares of restricted stock are subject to the terms
of the Plan and are unvested and outstanding as of September 30,
2016. The shares shall vest upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence
of a Change of Control, as defined in the Plan, (ii) the successful
completion of a Phase II clinical trial for any of the
Company s products, or (iii) the determination by the board
of directors to provide for immediate vesting. The weighted average
grant-date fair value is $1.07 per share. 

The following is a summary of all common stock option activity for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.14. 

At September 30, 2016, the weighted average remaining contractual
term for exercisable and outstanding options is 3.98 and 4.93
years, respectively.  At September 30, 2016, the
aggregate intrinsic value of all of the Company s exercisable
and outstanding options is $6,750 and $6,750,
respectively. 

Employee stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is $31,343 and $169,641,
respectively. 

F-16 

Table of Contents  

To compute compensation expense, the Company estimated the fair
value of each option award on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model for employees, and calculated
the fair value of each option award at the end of the period for
non-employees.  The Company based the expected volatility
assumption on a volatility index of peer companies as the Company
did not have sufficient historical market information to estimate
the volatility of its own stock.  The expected term of
options granted represents the period of time that options are
expected to be outstanding.  The Company estimated the
expected term of stock options by using the simplified method. The
expected forfeiture rates are based on the historical employee
forfeiture experiences.  To determine the risk-free
interest rate, the Company utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the
expected term of the Company s awards.  The Company
has not declared a dividend on its common stock since its inception
and has no intentions of declaring a dividend in the foreseeable
future and therefore used a dividend yield of zero. 

The fair value of each share-based payment is estimated on the
measurement date using the Black-Scholes model with the following
assumptions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:
risk-free rate with a range from 1.60% - 1.83% and 1.82% - 2.06%,
respectively, volatility of 68.08% and 49.42%, respectively, and
expected term of 5 years and 5 years,
respectively.  There was no dividend yield included in
the calculations. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $35,146 of unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested options. The unrecognized
compensation expense is estimated to be recognized over a period of
1.99 years at September 30, 2016.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

License Agreements 

On June 26, 2014, the Company and The General Hospital Corporation,
d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) entered
into two license agreements (the  Agreements ), which
Agreements replace the single license agreement between the Company
and MGH dated April 27, 2009, as amended by letter dated June 21,
2011 and agreement dated October 31, 2011 (the  Original
Agreement ). The Agreements provide exclusive licenses for
the Company s two lead product candidates, BFPET and
CardioPET, two of the three cardiac imaging technologies covered by
the Original Agreement. The Company and MGH are in discussions
regarding the exclusive license to VasoPET, the third product
candidate covered by the Original Agreement, the Company s
rights to which ceased upon the termination of the Original
Agreement contemporaneously with the execution of the new
Agreements. The Agreements were entered into primarily for the
purpose of separating the Company s rights and obligations
with respect to its different product development programs. Each of
the Agreements requires the Company to pay MGH an initial license
fee of $175,000 and annual license maintenance fees of $125,000
each. The Agreements require the Company to meet certain
obligations, including, but not limited to, meeting certain
development milestones relating to clinical trials and filings with
the United States Food and Drug Administration. MGH has the right
to cancel or make non-exclusive certain licenses on certain patents
should the Company fail to meet stipulated obligations and
milestones. Additionally, upon commercialization, the Company is
required to make specified milestone payments and royalties on
commercial sales.      The Company is amortizing the cost of these
intangible assets over the remaining useful life of the Agreements
of 10 years.  

On July 31, 2015, the Company paid annual maintenance fees of
$125,000 for each of its license agreements.  These costs
are recorded as prepaid expenses, included in prepaid expenses and
other current assets on the Company s balance sheet and
expensed over the term of one year. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded maintenance fee
expense of $187,500. 

On August 10, 2016, the Company entered into agreements with
MGH to amend the Agreements to provide for the payment of the
annual license fees to be separated into two payments of $62,500
each. The first payment to be due 90 days from the amendment
effective date, June 1, 2016 and the second payment to be due 6
months from that date.  In addition, the Agreements
were amended to include the potential to
license technical information in addition to intellectual
property. 

The Company is current with all stipulated obligations and
milestones under the Agreements and the Agreements remain in full
force and effect. The Company believes that it maintains a good
relationship with MGH and will be able to obtain waivers or
extension of its obligations under the Agreement, should the need
arise. If MGH were to refuse to provide the Company with a waiver
or extension of any of its obligations or were to cancel or make
the license non-exclusive, this would have a material adverse
impact on the Company as it may be unable to commercialize products
without exclusivity and would lose its competitive edge for
portions of the patent portfolio.

Clinical Research Services Agreements 

On September 7, 2012, the Company entered into a Clinical Research
Services Agreement with SGS Life Science Services
( SGS ), a company with its registered offices in
Belgium, for clinical research services relating to the
Company s CardioPET Phase II study to assess myocardial
perfusion and fatty acid uptake in coronary artery disease (CAD)
patients. 

In addition, the Company engaged FGK Representative Service GmbH to
serve as the Company s sponsor in compliance with the laws
governing clinical trials conducted in the European Union. In
December 2014, the Company announced that the enrollment for a
Phase II clinical trial of CardioPET was closed. On September 21,
2016, the Company and SGS have entered into settlement negotiations
and reached a resolution of the dispute regarding rights and
obligations under the Clinical Trial Agreement. The settlement

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in discovering,
developing and commercializing molecular imaging pharmaceuticals
with initial applications in the area of cardiology. Molecular
imaging pharmaceuticals are radiopharmaceuticals that enable early
detection of disease through the visualization of subtle changes in
biochemical and biological processes.  We currently have
two clinical-stage molecular imaging pharmaceutical product
candidates: CardioPET and BFPET. Additionally we have identified
potential candidates that may be useful in the detection and/or
treatment of vulnerable plaque. 

Our Product Candidates 

BFPET (18-F FTPP) 

Our BFPET program employs
a ([18F]-labeled cationic lipophilic tetraphenylphosphonium ion
(18-F TPP) as an imaging agent designed for use in stress-testing
for patients with presumptive or proven CAD. 18-F FTPP measures the
extent and severity of cardiovascular disease through the detection
of ischemic (i.e. reversible and viable) and infarcted (i.e.,
irreversibly damaged) myocardial (i.e., heart) tissue. Its
mechanism of action allows it to enter the myocardial cells of the
heart muscle in direct proportion to blood flow and membrane
potential--the most important indicators of adequate cardiac blood
supply. Since ischemic and infarcted myocardial cells take up
significantly less 18-F FTPP than normal healthy myocardial cells
do, 18-F FTPP can distinguish ischemic and infarcted cells from
those that are healthy. If approved, 18-F FTPP will represent one
of the first molecular imaging blood flow agents commercialized for
use in the cardiovascular segment of the PET imaging market. 18-F
FTPP may also provide information on cardiac mitochondrial membrane
potential, enabling global and regional assessment of the
electro-physiologic integrity of the
myocardium.  

Currently, cardiac perfusion imaging is performed routinely with
SPECT tracers such as Sestamibi, Tetrofosmin, Thallium-201 or the
PET tracers Rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia. However, the industry
standard SPECT imaging has a diagnostic accuracy of approximately
75%, with research indicating that 10% of patients cleared as
 normal  were subsequently found to be
 abnormal  using PET imaging. The current PET tracer
Rubidium-82 has experienced an FDA recall and high cost issues,
while N-13 ammonia is produced in a cyclotron and must be used
locally within a matter of minutes due to a very short physical
half-life. The introduction of a Fluorine-labeled myocardial agent,
with its longer half-life enabling the existing supply-chain
potential, would be a catalyzing event toward advancing the role of
PET imaging in cardiovascular disease and improving diagnostic
imaging. 

18-F FTPP successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial in 12
healthy volunteers with no adverse events and no clinically
significant changes noted in follow-up clinical and laboratory
testing. The results of the trial demonstrated the required
dosimetry, safety profile and high resolution myocardial imaging
pharmacokinetics to justify a controlled Phase II clinical trial.
We have announced that we will begin Phase II trials at
Massachusetts General Hospital to assess its efficacy in CAD
subjects; and expect enrollment to commence in 2016.

CardioPET (18-F FCPHA) 

Our CardioPET program employs Trans-9-[18F]-Fluoro-3,
4-Methyleneheptadecanoic Acid (18-F FCPHA) as a molecular imaging
agent designed to assess myocardial blood flow and metabolism in
patients with
CAD, including  patients  unable to
perform exercise cardiac stress-testing. 18-F FCPHA allows for the
potential detection of ischemic (i.e. reversible and viable) and
infarcted (i.e. irreversibly damaged) myocardial tissue in patients
with presumptive or proven acute and chronic CAD and related
cardiac diseases. 

In addition, 18-F FCPHA could be useful for assessing myocardial
viability for the prediction of improvement prior to and/or
following revascularization in patients with acute CAD, including
myocardial infarction (heart attack). 18-F FCPHA allows for the
identification of compromised but viable heart tissue, which is
important since revascularization in those patients with
substantial viable myocardium results in improved left ventricular
function and survival. Importantly, 18-F FCPHA, if approved, may
have several significant advantages for assessing cardiac viability
using PET, and would likely represent the first imaging agent
available in the U.S. for use in patients with chronic CAD and
underlying metabolic disorders. 18-F FCPHA is designed to provide
the fatty-acid metabolic component for assessing myocardial
metabolism and viability, which play a central role in the
progression of diabetes and heart failure. 

The safety and tolerability of 18-F FCPHA have been demonstrated in
a Phase I trial conducted at the Massachusetts General
Hospital.  Enrollment in a Phase IIa trial has been
completed at four sites in Belgium to assess its safety and
efficacy in CAD patients.  This Phase IIa study was an
open label trial designed to assess the safety and diagnostic
performance of 18-F FCPHA compared with standard-of-care myocardial
perfusion imaging, and angiography as a gold standard of epicardial
coronary artery disease. Specifically, the Phase IIa trial
consisted of approximately 30 individuals with known or suspected
stable chronic CAD who underwent imaging at rest and after
pharmacologic and exercise stress-testing for the evaluation of
suspected or proven CAD. Interim safety and imaging results were
presented in February 2014, and the final safety and efficacy
analysis is ongoing. The enrollment for the Phase IIa clinical
trial of CardioPET was closed in December 2014.     

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern.  The core principle of the guidance is that an
entity s management should evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are available to be issued. When management identifies
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an
entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management
should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate
those relevant conditions or events that will alleviate the
substantial doubt are adequately disclosed in the footnotes to the
financial statements. This guidance will be effective for the
annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter. 

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ) which requires
that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as
noncurrent on the balance sheet.  The current requirement that
deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an
entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected
by this guidance.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 but early
application is permitted and the guidance may be applied either
prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or
retrospectively to all periods presented.  

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
 FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2015-03, 'Interest - Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs . ASU 2015-03 is intended to simplify the presentation
of debt issuance costs. These amendments require that debt issuance
costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The
recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are
not affected by the amendments in this ASU. This new guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted
ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and applied the standard
retrospectively.

In January 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-01  Income Statement -
Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of
Extraordinary Items . This ASU removes the concept of an
extraordinary item.  Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement -
Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately
classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and
transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be
an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless
evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary
item.  If an event or transaction meets the criteria for
extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate
the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and
show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after
income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to
disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose
earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. 
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015.  The Company adopted this standard on January 1,
2016.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material
impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases , which requires a lessee to recognize lease
liabilities for the lessee s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and
right-of-use assets, representing the lessee s right to use,
or control the use of, specified assets for the lease
term.  Additionally, the new guidance has simplified
accounting for sale and leaseback transactions.  Lessor
accounting is largely unchanged.  The ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018.  Early application is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on the
financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation . The areas for simplification in
this update involve several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For
public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in
any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the
amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be
reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all
of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on the financial
statements. 

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230  ) ,   a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues
Task Force. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in
practice in how certain transactions are classified in the
statement of cash flows.     For public business entities, the standard is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted,
provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.
The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition
method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this ASU on the financial statements.  

Management does not expect any other recently issued, but not yet
effective, accounting standards to have a material effect on its
results of operations or financial condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to
assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements. The
consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of
our management, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to U.S. GAAP and
have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
statements. 

Intangible Assets 

Our intangible assets consist of technology licenses and are
carried at the legal cost to obtain them. Intangible assets are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life. Useful lives on technology licenses are 5 to 15
years. 

-3- 

Table of Contents  

Impairments 

We assess the impairment of its intangible assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may
not be recoverable in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-35,
 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  The
determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not
these assets are impaired involves significant judgments, related
primarily to the future profitability and/or future value of the
assets. We record an impairment charge if it believes an investment
has experienced a decline in value that is other than
temporary. 

We have determined that no impairments were required as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

We group our assets and liabilities measured at fair value, in
three levels based on the markets in which the assets and
liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used
to determine fair value.  Fair value is defined as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (an exit price). 

Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices
or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices
generally will have a higher degree of market price observability
and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair
value. 

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows: 

Level
1   Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.  Valuations are obtained
from readily available pricing sources for market transactions
involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2   Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level
1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level
3   Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3
assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is
determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for
which the determination of fair value requires significant
management judgment or estimation. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall
into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In
such cases, an instrument s level within the fair value
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in
its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to
the financial instrument. 

We recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting
period as if the transfers occurred on the last day of the
reporting period. 

License Revenue Policy 

From time to time we enter into licensing agreements, the terms of
which may include grants of licenses, or options to obtain
licenses, to our intellectual property and research and development
activities. Payments under these arrangements typically include one
or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees;
funding of research and/or development efforts; amounts due upon
the achievement of specified objectives; and/or royalties on future
product sales. 

We recognize milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon
the achievement of a substantive milestone if the consideration
earned from the achievement of the milestone (i) is consistent with
performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in
value to the delivered item, (ii) relates solely to past
performance and (iii) is reasonable relative to all of the other
deliverables and payments within the arrangement.  Amounts
received contractually designated to fund further research are
recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses when
we have satisfied all performance obligations to the licensee and
expenses for specified development activities have been
incurred.    

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

General 

To date, we have not generated any revenues from operations and at
September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$34.9 million, primarily as a result of research and development,
or R D, expenses and general and administrative, or G A,
expenses. While we may in the future generate revenue from a
variety of sources, including license fees, research and
development payments in connection with strategic partnerships
and/or government grants, our product candidates are at an early
stage of development and may never be successfully developed or
commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur
substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future and
there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant
revenues. 

-4- 

Table of Contents  

R D Expenses 

Conducting R D is central to our business. R D expenses
consist primarily of: 

employee-related
expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and rent
expense; 

license
fees and annual payments related to in-licensed products and
intellectual property; 

expenses
incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations,
investigative sites and consultants that conduct or provide other
services relating to our clinical trials and a substantial portion
of our preclinical activities; 

the
cost of acquiring clinical trial materials from third party
manufacturers; and 

costs
associated with non-clinical activities, patent filings and
regulatory filings. 

We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our
R D activities for the foreseeable future as we continue
product development. Since product candidates in later stages of
clinical development generally have higher development costs than
those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to
the increased size and duration of later stage clinical trials, we
expect that our R D expenses will increase in the future. In
addition, if our product development efforts are successful, we
expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential
commercialization of any late-stage product candidates and, in the
event one or more of these product candidates receive regulatory
approval, to fund the launch of the product. 

G A Expenses 

G A expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs,
professional fees for legal, consulting and audit services, rent
and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in
R D. We anticipate G A expenses will increase in future
periods, reflecting continued and increasing costs associated
with: 

support
of our expanded R D activities; 

an
expanding infrastructure and increased professional fees and other
costs associated with the compliance with the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and stock exchange regulatory requirements and
compliance; and 

business
development and financing activities. 

Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

G A expenses were $341,457 and $492,974 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 30.7% decrease
was due primarily to a decrease in legal costs related to
litigation and financings, reduced investor relations activities,
as well as a general decrease in operating expenses. G A
expenses were $1,273,468 and $1,773,996 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 28.2% decrease was
due primarily to a decrease in legal costs related to litigation
and financings, reduced investor relations activities, as well as a
general decrease in operating expenses. We expect G A expenses
to increase going forward as we proceed to advance our product
candidates through the development and regulatory
process. 

R D expenses were $(21,836) and $291,618 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 107.5 %
decrease was due primarily to the reimbursement of certain R D
expenses as a result of the Company s license agreement with
Sinotau USA, Inc. R D expenses were $407,491 and $576,824 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The 29.4% decrease was due primarily to the reimbursement of
certain R D expenses as a result of the Company s license
agreement with Sinotau USA, Inc.  We expect R D
expenses to increase in future periods as our product candidates
continue through clinical trials and we seek strategic
collaborations.

and interest and other expense of approximately $1,065,514, which
primarily related to the interest expense on convertible notes
payable. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we recorded a gain on settlements of accounts payable of
approximately $105,888. For the nine months ended September 30,
2015, other income, net consisted primarily of realized and
unrealized losses on trading securities of approximately $3,960 and
a gain on revaluation and modification of the Company s
derivative warrant liability of approximately $856,327 and interest
and other expense of $398,775, which primarily related to the
issuance of notes payable. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since our inception.  We have sustained
cumulative losses attributable to common stockholders of
approximately $34.9 million as of September 30, 2016.  We
have historically financed our operations through issuances of
equity and the proceeds of debt instruments. In the past, we have
also provided for our cash needs by issuing common stock, options
and warrants for certain operating costs, including consulting and
professional fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we issued convertible promissory notes and other short term notes
payable to a certain accredited investors and received gross
proceeds of $510,000. 

At September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents of
approximately $30,000. We continue to actively pursue various
funding options, including equity offerings, to obtain additional
funds to continue our product development activities beyond such
date. We will seek funds through equity or debt financings,
collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or
through other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be
available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds
are not available to us, we will be required to delay, curtail or
eliminate one or more of our research and development
programs. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued convertible
promissory notes to certain accredited investors and received gross
proceeds of $2,980,005.  In addition, during the year
ended December 31, 2015, we received gross proceeds of $365,000
from the issuance of short-term notes payable and $35,970 from the
sale of freely tradable securities received pursuant to the
issuance and sale in a private placement of promissory
notes. 

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $763,882, which primarily reflected our net
loss of $1,922,627 including a non-cash gain on revaluation of
the derivative liability of $1,713,693, offset by other non-cash
expenses of $1,711,221 and changes in the components of working
capital of $1,161,217. Net cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $1,709,450, which

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during our second fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

PA R T II - OTHER
INFORMATION 

Ite m  1.  Legal
Proceedings 

We are not aware of any material, active, pending or threatened
proceeding, nor are we, or any subsidiary, involved as a plaintiff
or defendant in any other material proceeding or pending
litigation. 

Ite m  1A.  Risk
Factors 

There have been no material changes in the Company s risk
factors from those previously disclosed in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K, initially filed with the SEC on March
30, 2016, except for the following risk factor: 

If the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, its
securities will have little or no value. 

The report of the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm that accompanies the Company's audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains
a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $32.6 million. The Company believes it
will have sufficient cash to fund its operations through November
2016.  The Company continues to pursue various funding options
and will make every effort to raise the necessary capital. The
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of
the Company to obtain necessary equity and/or debt financing to
continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company cannot make any
assurances that additional financings will be completed on a timely
basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to
complete a debt or equity offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient
financing when and if needed, it would negatively impact it s
business and operations, which could cause the price of its common
stock to decline. It could also lead to the reduction or suspension
of the Company s operations and ultimately force the Company
to go out of business.
