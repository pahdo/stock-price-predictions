Note 1. Organization 
  American Capital Senior Floating, Ltd. (which is referred to as  ACSF ,  we ,  us  and  our ) was organized in February 2013 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on October 15, 2013.  We are structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment management company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ).  In November 2013, we formed a wholly-owned special purpose financing vehicle, ACSF Funding I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( ACSF Funding ).  
  In January 2014, we completed an initial public offering ( IPO ) of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $15.00 per share for gross proceeds of $150,000.  Upon completion of the IPO, we became externally managed by American Capital ACSF Management, LLC (our  Manager ), an indirect subsidiary of American Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ACAM ), which is a wholly-owned portfolio company of American Capital, Ltd. ( American Capital ).  Prior to the completion of our IPO, we were wholly-owned by ACAM.  Following completion of the IPO, ACAM owned approximately 3% of our outstanding common stock, the maximum amount permissible under the 1940 Act.  In conjunction with the IPO, our Manager paid the underwriting commissions of $7,952.  Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where it trades under the symbol  ACSF .  We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and to be taxed as a regulated investment company ( RIC ), as defined in Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).   
  Investment Objective  
  Our investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns over the long term primarily through current income while seeking to preserve our capital.  We actively manage a leveraged portfolio composed primarily of diversified investments in first lien and second lien floating rate loans principally to large-market U.S.-based companies (collectively,  Senior Floating Rate Loans  or  SFRLs ) which are commonly referred to as leveraged loans. We also invest in equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) which are securitized vehicles collateralized primarily by SFRLs and we may invest in debt tranches of CLOs.  In addition, we may selectively invest in loans issued by middle market companies, mezzanine and unitranche loans and high yield bonds.  Additionally, we may from time to time hold or invest in other equity investments and other debt or equity securities generally arising from a restructuring of Senior Floating Rate Loan positions previously held by us.  
   
  Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim period have been included.  The current period's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year.  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiary, ACSF Funding.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of ACSF Funding are prepared for the same reporting period as ours using consistent accounting policies.  Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.    
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.

Investment Classification 
  As required by the 1940 Act, investments are classified by level of control.  Control Investments  are defined as investments in portfolio companies that we are deemed to control, as defined in the 1940 Act.   Affiliate Investments  are investments in those companies that are affiliated companies, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments.   Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments  are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.  
  Generally, under the 1940 Act, we are deemed to control a company in which we have invested if we own more than 25% of the voting securities of such company.  We are deemed to be an affiliate of a company if we own 5% or more of the voting securities of such company.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all of our investments were Non-Control/Non-Affiliate investments. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  We value our investments in accordance with the 1940 Act and Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ), as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.   Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for our investments existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on the investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned.     
  We undertake a multi-step valuation process to determine the fair value of our investments in accordance with ASC 820. The valuation process begins with the development of a preliminary valuation recommendation for each investment as determined in accordance with our valuation policy by a group of our Manager s valuation, accounting and finance professionals, which is independent of our Manager's investment team.  To prepare the proposed valuation, the group reviews information provided by a nationally recognized independent pricing service, broker-dealers, and may consult with the investment team and other internal resources of our Manager and its affiliates. The preliminary valuation recommendations are then presented to the Investment Committee and reviewed and approved by our Audit and Compliance Committee.  The valuation recommendations are then reviewed by our Board of Directors for final approval.    
  Securities Transactions  
  Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date.  The trade date for loans purchased in the  primary market  is considered the date on which the loan allocations are determined.  The trade date for loans and other investments purchased in the  secondary market  is the date on which the transaction is entered into.  The trade date for primary CLO equity transactions and any other security transaction entered outside conventional channels is the date we have determined all material terms have been defined for the transaction and (a) we have obtained a right to demand the securities purchased and incur an obligation to pay the price of the securities purchased or (b) we have obtained a right to collect the proceeds of a sale and incurred an obligation to deliver the securities sold.  Cost is determined based on consideration given, adjusted for amortization of original issuance discounts ( OID ), market discounts and premiums. 
  Realized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
  Realized gain or loss from an investment is recorded at the time of disposition and calculated using the weighted average cost method.   Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the changes in fair value of investments as determined in compliance with the valuation policy as discussed in   Note 6   in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  Income Taxes 
  As a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income distributed to our stockholders as a dividend.  We intend to distribute 100% of our taxable income, within the Subchapter M rules, and therefore do not anticipate incurring corporate-level U.S. federal or state income tax.  As a RIC, we are also subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax if we do not distribute at least 98% of net ordinary income, 98.2% of any capital gain net income and any recognized and undistributed taxable income from prior years.  
  ASC Topic 740,   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed.  ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or provision in the current year.  Determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at

a later date based upon factors, including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  We are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months.  
   Investment Income 
    For debt investments, we record interest income on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.  OID and purchased discounts and premiums are accreted into interest income using the effective interest method, where applicable.  Loan origination fees are deferred and accreted into interest income using the effective interest method.  We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when such amounts are received.  We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible.    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had two loans on non-accrual status. 
    Interest income on CLO equity investments is recognized using the effective interest method as required by FASB ASC Subtopic 325-40,   Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets   ( ASC 325-40 ). Under ASC 325-40, at the time of purchase, we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective yield of an investment based on these estimated cash flows and our cost basis. Subsequent to the purchase, these estimated cash flows are updated quarterly and a revised yield is calculated prospectively in accordance with ASC 320-10-35,   Investment-Debt and Equity Securities  . In the event that the fair value of an investment decreases below its current amortized cost basis, we may be required to write down the current amortized cost basis for a credit loss or to fair value depending on our hold expectations for the investment.  Current amortized cost basis less the amount of any write down ( Reference Amount ) is used to calculate the effective yield used for interest income recognition purposes over the remaining life of the investment.  We are precluded from reversing write downs for any subsequent increase in the expected cash flows of an investment with the effect of increasing total interest income over the life of the investment and increasing the realized loss recorded on the sale or redemption of the investment by the amount of the credit loss write down. In estimating these cash flows, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. These include the amount and timing of principal payments (including prepayments, repurchases, defaults and liquidations), the pass through or coupon rate, and interest rate fluctuations. In addition, interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying loans and the timing and magnitude of projected credit losses on the loans underlying the securities have to be estimated. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income.  As a result, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded $0.2 million in credit loss write downs to the current amortized cost basis on our CLO equity investments on one CLO equity investment.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded $1.3 million in credit loss write downs to current amortized cost basis on four CLO equity investments.  During both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded no credit loss write downs to the current amortized cost basis on our CLO equity investments. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including those held in overnight sweep bank deposit accounts. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit. 
  Consolidation 
  As permitted under Article 6 of Regulation S-X and as explained by ASC 946-810-45,   Financial Services - Investment Companies - Consolidation  , we will generally not consolidate an investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists primarily of providing services to us.  Accordingly, we have consolidated the results of ACSF Funding in our consolidated financial statements.   
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    Deferred financing costs represent fees and other direct expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of debt.  These costs are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the estimated average life of the borrowings.  
  Distributions to Stockholders 
  Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
  Other General and Administrative Expenses 
  Other general and administrative expenses include audit and tax, professional fees, board of directors' fees, rent, IT system costs, custody, transfer agent and other operating expenses.  These expenses are recognized on an accrual basis.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which makes targeted improvements to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 focuses primarily on the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for certain financial instruments. Among its provisions for public business entities, ASU 2016-01 eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, requires the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables). ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01 and do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016,  the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40,   Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets   related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public business entities that meet the U.S. GAAP definition of an SEC filer, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the recognition of interest income on our investments in CLO equity.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under ASC 230,   Statement of Cash Flows  , and other topics. The Update provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues including the statement cash flows treatment of beneficial interests in securitized financial transactions as well as the treatment of debt prepayment and extinguishment costs. ASU 2016-15 also provides guidance on the predominance principle to clarify when cash receipts and cash payments should be separated into more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated statements of cash flows.  
   
  Note 3  . Management Agreement 
  Our management agreement with our Manager, has a current renewal term expiring January 15, 2017.  Under the management agreement, our Manager has agreed to provide investment advisory services to us, in addition to providing personnel, facilities and additional services necessary for our operations.  Unless terminated earlier, the management agreement will automatically renew following the expiration of its current term for successive one year periods if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not  Interested Persons  as defined under the 1940 Act.  Our Board of Directors and a majority of our directors who are not  Interested Persons , as defined under the 1940 Act, have approved a renewal of the management agreement until January 15, 2017 and, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment and restatement of the management agreement, as described below. 
  Pursuant to the management agreement, our Manager has agreed to be responsible for certain of our operating expenses in excess of 0.75% of our consolidated net assets, less net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, each as determined under GAAP at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter for the first 24 months following the date of our IPO (the  Expense Cap ).  Operating expenses subject to this reimbursement include both (i) our operating expenses reimbursed to our Manager and its affiliates for the expenses related to our operations incurred on our behalf and (ii) our operating expenses directly incurred by us, excluding the management fee, interest costs, taxes and accrued costs and fees related to actual, pending or threatened litigation, each as determined under GAAP for the most recently completed fiscal quarter. As a result of this Expense Cap, any reimbursements to our Manager and its affiliates could be reduced or eliminated, and in certain instances, our Manager could be required to reimburse us so that our other expenses do not exceed the Expense Cap.  Our Manager has agreed to extend the Expense Cap until the date of our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which time we expect to submit to a vote of stockholders an amendment and

restatement of the management agreement which would (i) extend the Expense Cap through December 31, 2020, (ii) subject to the Expense Cap, provide for reimbursement by us to our Manager for certain compensation expenses related to legal, compliance and internal audit personnel of our Manager and its affiliates who provide services to us necessary for our operations that are not required to be provided by our Manager under the management agreement and (iii) make certain other immaterial changes.  Following the expiration of the Expense Cap, we will be fully responsible for the payment of our operating expenses.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our Manager was responsible for   $283   and   $976  , respectively, of operating expenses as a result of the Expense Cap.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , our Manager was responsible for   $193   and   $665  , respectively, of operating expenses as a result of the Expense Cap. 
  Our Manager receives a management fee from us that is payable quarterly in arrears.  The management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 0.80% of our total consolidated assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, each as determined under GAAP at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.  There is no incentive compensation paid to our Manager under the management agreement.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized management fee expenses of   $512   and   $1,520  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized management fee expenses of   $558   and   $1,699  , respectively.  
  Since our Manager has no employees, it has entered into an administrative agreement with both its parent and American Capital pursuant to which our Manager will be provided with personnel, services and resources necessary for our Manager to perform its obligations under the management agreement as well as provide certain additional services.

Note 6  . Investments 
  We value our investments at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.   Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for our investments existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on the investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. 
  ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. When available, we determine the fair value of our investments using unadjusted quoted prices from active markets. Where inputs for an asset or liability fall into more than one level in the fair value hierarchy, the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment's fair value measurement. We use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment when determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and out of levels as of the beginning of each reporting period. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below:    
  Level 1:     Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.     
  Level 2:     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This may include valuations based on executed trades, broker quotations that constitute an executable price, and alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs which, in each case, are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset in connection with market data at the measurement date.     
  Level 3:     Inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. In certain cases, investments classified within Level 3 may include securities for which we have obtained indicative quotes from broker-dealers that do not necessarily represent prices the broker may be willing to trade on.    
    The valuation techniques used maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our Senior Floating Rate Loans are predominately valued based on evaluated prices from a nationally recognized independent pricing service or from third-party brokers who make markets in such debt investments. When possible, we make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand their use of significant inputs and assumptions. We review the third-party fair value estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range and dispersion of third-party estimates, frequency of pricing updates, comparison of recent trade activity for similar securities, and review for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date.     
  There may be instances when independent or third-party pricing sources are not available, or cases where we believe that the third-party pricing sources do not provide sufficient evidence to support a market participant's view of the fair value of the debt investment being valued. These instances may result from an investment in a less liquid loan such as a middle market loan, a mezzanine loan or unitranche loan, or a loan to a company that has become financially distressed. In these instances, we may estimate the fair value based on a combination of a market yield valuation methodology and evaluated pricing discussed above, or solely based on a market yield valuation methodology. Under the market yield valuation methodology, we estimate the fair value based on a discounted cash flow technique. For these debt investments, the unobservable inputs used in the market yield valuation methodology to measure fair value reflect management's best estimate of assumptions that would be used by market participants when pricing the investment in a hypothetical transaction, including estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date. We will estimate the remaining life based on market data for the average life of similar loans. However, if we have information that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term, we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date. The average life to be used to estimate the fair value of our loans may be shorter than the legal maturity of the loans since many loans are prepaid prior to the maturity date. The interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on current interest rate spreads of similar loans. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a loan, we may consider other factors that a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value, including the anticipated proceeds that would be received in a liquidation.    
  We estimate the fair value of our CLO equity investments using a combination of third-party broker quotes, purchases or sales of the same or similar securities, and cash flow forecasts subject to assumptions that a market participant would use regarding the investments' underlying collateral, including, but not limited to, assumptions for default and recovery rates, reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates. Cash flow forecasts are discounted using market participant's market yield assumptions

that are derived from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, third-party broker quotes, industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, when determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance and other market indices.   For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no changes to our valuation techniques or to the types of unobservable inputs used in the valuation process compared to the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of CLO equity include the default and prepayment rates used to establish projected cash flows and the discount rate applied in the valuation models to those projected cash flows.  An increase in any one of these individual inputs in isolation would likely result in a decrease to fair value.  However, given the interrelationship between these inputs, overall market conditions would likely have a more significant impact on our Level 3 fair values than changes in any one unobservable input.

Note 7. Debt  
  Secured Revolving Credit Facility    
  On October 29, 2015, ACSF Funding amended and restated its secured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended and restated, the  Credit Facility ) to extend the maturity date from December 18, 2015 to December 18, 2018, to decrease the commitment amount from $140,000 to $135,000 and to eliminate the commitment fee when the facility is at least 90% utilized.  ACSF Funding may make draws under the Credit Facility from time to time to purchase or acquire certain eligible assets.  The Credit Facility is secured by ACSF Funding s assets pursuant to a security agreement and contains customary financial and negative covenants and events of default.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the assets pledged as collateral in ACSF Funding were   $174,299   and   $187,895  , respectively.  The Credit Facility is non-recourse to ACSF. Amounts drawn under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (a) LIBOR plus 1.80%, or (b) 0.80% plus the highest of (i) the Federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America, N.A. s prime rate or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. ACSF Funding may borrow, prepay and reborrow loans under the Credit Facility at any time prior to November 18, 2018, the commitment termination date, subject to certain terms and conditions, including maintaining a borrowing base. Any outstanding balance on the Credit Facility as of the commitment termination date must be repaid by the maturity date unless otherwise extended. Following the amendment to the Credit Facility on October 29, 2015, if ACSF Funding terminates the commitment amount in whole or in part prior to December 18, 2017, ACSF Funding will be required to pay a make-whole fee equal to the sum of the present values of all future spread amounts that would have been payable in respect of the total commitments (or terminated portion thereof) during the period from the termination date through December 18, 2017. 
  ACSF Funding is required to pay a commitment fee in an amount equal to 0.75% on the actual daily unused amount of the current lender commitments under the Credit Facility to the extent the outstanding amount of committed loans is less than an amount equal to 90% of the aggregate commitments from October 29, 2015 to the commitment termination date, payable quarterly in arrears.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $100,000   outstanding under the Credit Facility, which had a fair value of   $100,000   and an interest rate of   2.27%  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   $110,200   outstanding under the Credit Facility, which had a fair value of   $110,200   and an interest rate of   2.02%  . The fair value of the Credit Facility is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions and is measured with Level 3 inputs.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , ACSF Funding was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility, including compliance with a borrowing base that applies various advance rates of up to 80% on the investments pledged as collateral by ACSF Funding.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred interest and commitment fees on the Credit Facility of   $642   and   $1,900  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred interest and commitment fees on the Credit Facility of   $667   and   $1,986  , respectively.

The following table outlines key statistics related to our debt financing for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :          

Note 8. Taxes 
  Tax Sharing Agreement 
   For the period prior to our IPO, during which we were treated as a taxable corporation under Subchapter C of the Code ( C corporation ) for tax purposes, we had a tax sharing agreement with American Capital and other members of its consolidated tax group, under which such members bore their full share of their individual tax obligation and members were compensated for their losses and other tax benefits that were able to be used by other members of the consolidated tax group based on their pro-forma stand-alone federal income tax return.  
  We applied for retroactive relief under IRC Section 9100 to make a  deemed sale election  whereby we will treat our net unrealized gains ( Net Built-in Gain ) on the date of our IPO as recognized for tax purposes in our final pre-IPO C corporation federal tax return.  In March 2016, we received retroactive relief approval from the IRS to make a  deemed sale election .  The late election statement was filed by American Capital along with its amended 2014 federal consolidated income tax return on May 17, 2016.  We have therefore treated the Net Built-in Gain on the date of our IPO as recognized for tax purposes in our final pre-IPO C corporation federal tax return.  The federal estimated tax sharing payment that we owed to American Capital attributed to our Net Built-in Gain was $563.  The entire amount was treated as a deemed capital contribution to us.  
  Income Taxes 
  We have elected to be treated as a RIC for income tax purposes beginning with the date of our IPO. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income, including net short term gains in excess of net long term losses. So long as we qualify as a RIC, we are not subject to the entity level taxes on earnings timely distributed to our stockholders. We intend to make sufficient annual distributions to substantially eliminate our corporate level income taxes.  
  Income determined under GAAP differs from income determined under tax because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, including (i) unrealized gains and losses associated with debt investments marked to fair value for GAAP but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled, (ii) timing difference on income recognition for our CLO equity investments, (iii) premium amortization and gain adjustments attributable to the Net Built-in Gain recognized upon our IPO and  (iv) capital losses in excess of capital gains do not reduce taxable income, and generally can be carried forward to offset capital gains.   
  At our discretion, we may delay distributions of a portion of our current year taxable income to the subsequent year and pay 4% excise taxes on such deferred distributions as calculated under the Code. If we anticipate paying excise taxes, we accrue excise taxes on a quarterly basis based on our estimates. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an excise tax provision of   $23  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an excise tax benefit of   $75  .  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded an excise tax provision of   $33   and   $173  , respectively.

  On August 3, 2016, we declared a monthly cash distribution to stockholders of $0.097 per share for each of August, September and October 2016.  On October 31, 2016, we declared a monthly cash distribution to stockholders of $0.097 per share for each of November 2016, December 2016 and January 2017.  Since our January 2014 IPO, we have declared a total of   $34.5 million   in distributions to stockholders, or   $3.454   per share.   
   
  Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, including actions brought against us and others with respect to investment transactions. The outcomes of any such legal proceedings are uncertain and, as a result of these proceedings, the values of the investments to which they relate could decrease. We were not subject to any material litigation against us as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  We did not engage in any off-balance sheet activities as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

  Overview 
  American Capital Senior Floating, Ltd. ( ACSF ,  we ,  our  and  us ), a Maryland corporation organized in February 2013 that commenced operations on October 15, 2013, is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment management company.  We have elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ). In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 
  On January 15, 2014, we priced our initial public offering ( IPO ), selling 10.0 million shares of common stock, at a price of $15.00 per share for net proceeds of $149.2 million.  Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where it trades under the symbol  ACSF .  We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ( JOBS Act ), and intend to take advantage of the exemption for emerging growth companies allowing us to temporarily forgo the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  We do not intend to take advantage of other disclosure or reporting exemptions for emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act.  
  Our investment activities are managed by American Capital ACSF Management, LLC (our  Manager ) for an annual base management fee of 0.80% of our total consolidated assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.  There is no incentive compensation paid to our Manager.    However, in connection with our IPO, our Manager agreed that our annual other operating expenses, as defined in our management agreement, will generally not exceed 75 basis points of ACSF s quarter end consolidated net assets, excluding unrealized gains or losses ( Expense Cap ) for the first 24 months following our IPO.  Our Manager has agreed to extend the Expense Cap until the date of our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which time we expect to submit to a vote of stockholders an amendment and restatement of the management agreement which would (i) extend the Expense Cap through December 31, 2020, (ii) subject to the Expense Cap, provide for reimbursement by us to our Manager for certain compensation expenses related to legal, compliance and internal audit personnel of our Manager and its affiliates who provide services to us necessary for our operations that are not required to be provided by our Manager under the management agreement and (iii) make certain other immaterial changes.  Following the expiration of the Expense Cap, we will be fully responsible for the payment of our operating expenses.

Investments 
  Our investment objective is to provide attractive, risk-adjusted returns over the long term primarily through current income while seeking to preserve our capital.  We actively manage a leveraged portfolio composed primarily of diversified investments in first lien and second lien floating rate loans principally to large-market U.S.-based companies (collectively,  Senior Floating Rate Loans" or  Loan Portfolio ) which are commonly referred to as leveraged loans. Standard and Poor's ( S P ) defines large-market loans as loans to issuers with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of greater than $50 million.  Senior Floating Rate Loans are typically collateralized by a company's assets and structured with first lien or second lien priority on collateral, providing for greater security and potential recovery in the event of default compared to other subordinated fixed-income products.  We also invest in equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) which are securitized vehicles collateralized primarily by Senior Floating Rate Loans and we may invest in debt tranches of CLOs.  In addition, we may selectively invest in loans issued by middle market companies, mezzanine and unitranche loans and high yield bonds.  Additionally, we may from time to time hold or invest in other equity investments and other debt or equity securities generally arising from a restructuring of Senior Floating Rate Loan positions previously held by us. Under normal market conditions, we will invest at least 80% of our assets in Senior Floating Rate Loans.  
  Our level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to U.S. based large-market private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.  As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  as defined by Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies .  The definition of  eligible portfolio company  includes private operating companies and certain public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million, in each case organized under the laws of and with their principal place of business located in the United States.  Investments in debt and equity tranches of CLOs are deemed nonqualified assets for BDC compliance purposes; therefore, under normal market conditions, we intend to limit our CLO investments to 20% of our portfolio.  
  Investment Income 
  We generate investment income primarily in the form of interest income from the investment securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may sell. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of three to seven years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark LIBOR, commercial paper rate, or the prime rate.  Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly but may be paid monthly or semi-annually.  
  Expenses 
  We do not have any employees and do not pay our officers any cash or non-cash equity compensation.  We pay, or reimburse our Manager and its affiliates, for expenses related to our operations incurred on our behalf, excluding employment-related expenses of our and our Manager's officers and any employees of American Capital or the parent company of our Manager who provide services to us pursuant to the management agreement or to our Manager pursuant to the administrative services agreement.  However, in accordance with the terms of our management agreement, our Manager agreed to limit the amount of operating expenses subject to reimbursement by us to the amount of the Expense Cap (See  Management Agreement  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion).  
  During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.  Interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods, among other factors. 
   
  Current Market Conditions  
  Economic and market conditions can impact our business and our investments in multiple ways, including the financial condition of the portfolio companies in which we invest, our investment returns, our funding costs, our access to the capital markets and our access to credit.  The leveraged loan market has grown substantially in recent years with the amount of total leveraged loans outstanding exceeding $870 billion as of   September 30, 2016  .  Growth has largely been a function of the resilient performance of the asset class across multiple credit cycles coupled with the changing regulatory and investor landscape and the attractive floating rate nature of the assets.  Despite the size and liquidity of the loan market, there continues to be volatility in the loan market as a result of (i) the dynamic correlation between retail fund flows, and (ii) the financial performance of the underlying issuers that comprise the asset class.  Despite uncertainties regarding economic and market conditions, the new issue loan pipeline in the leveraged loan market remains active, with first lien and second lien transactions that support leveraged buyouts, strategic acquisitions, plant expansions, recapitalizations and refinancings for large to mid-sized borrowers.  

35 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , technical factors in the leveraged loan market improved as retail outflows moderated, CLO issuance increased and loan market outstandings were essentially flat.  The technical environment contributed to a rebound in loan prices, as the average bid of the S P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index improved to 95.12 as of   September 30, 2016  ,     up from the December 31, 2015 average bid price of 91.26.  Similarly, technical factors resulted in an improvement in CLO equity prices from the prior quarter. CLO fair values as of   September 30, 2016   benefited from an improvement in loan prices and stronger bids from investors. 
   
  Portfolio and Investment Activity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was comprised of   76%   first lien loans,   7%   second lien loans and   17%   CLO equity, measured at fair value.  The Loan Portfolio consisted of   140   portfolio companies in   46   industries, and the CLO portfolio included   22   CLOs managed by   16   collateral managers with vintages ranging from 2012-2015.    Our Loan Portfolio consisted of all floating rate investments with   100%   having LIBOR floors ranging between   0.75%   and   1.75%  .  The weighted average LIBOR floor in our Loan Portfolio was   1%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The following table depicts a summary of the portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The portfolio is actively managed, with an annualized turnover ratio of   33.01%   and   35.64%  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Loan Portfolio rotation was reflective of the active management style, which seeks to optimize the portfolio based on current market conditions by rotating into positions that have better relative values.  The average yield during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   on the Loan Portfolio, CLO equity and Investment Portfolio was   5.37%  ,   10.83%   and   6.51%  , respectively.  The average yield during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   on the Loan Portfolio, CLO equity and Investment Portfolio was   5.40%  ,   10.64%   and   6.51%  , respectively.

Results of Operations 
    
  Operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Investment Income 
  Investment income   decreased     $0.4 million  , or   8.0%  , to   $4.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015  .  The decrease was a result of a smaller investment portfolio, on average, during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015.  Investment income   decreased     $1.4 million  , or   9.6%  , to   $13.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015  , due to a smaller investment portfolio, on average, during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015.   

40 

Net Expenses 
    Net expenses   decreased     $0.2   million, or   9.4%  , to   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015  .  The decline was driven by a reduction of interest expense due to less debt outstanding and lower management fees as a result of lower Net Assets during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015.  Net expenses   decreased     $0.5 million  , or   10.3%  , to   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   over the comparable period in   2015  .  The decline was driven by a reduction of interest expense due to less debt outstanding and lower management fees as a result of lower Net Assets during the comparable period in 2016. 
  The following table outlines the costs associated with our debt financing during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

(1)  Includes interest, unfunded commitment fees and amortization of debt financing costs 
  Net Realized Gain (Loss) 
  Sales and repayments of investments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $23.9 million   resulting in net realized losses of   $0.2 million  .  Sales and repayments of investments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $76.7 million   resulting in net realized losses of   $1.5 million  .   
  Sales and repayments of investments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled   $19.8 million   resulting in net realized gains of less than $0.1 million.  Sales and repayments of investments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled   $103.4 million   resulting in net realized gains of   $0.4 million  . 
  Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized net unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio of   $7.4 million   driven by net unrealized appreciation of $4.1 million on the Loan Portfolio and $3.3 million of net unrealized appreciation on the CLO Portfolio.  The primary driver for the increase in fair value of the Loan Portfolio was higher prices in the broadly syndicated U.S. loan market as a result of improved loan issuance and tightening yields during the quarter.  The increase in fair value of the CLO Portfolio was a result of tightening spreads and increasing trades in CLO equity.  
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized net unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio of    $15.3 million   driven by net unrealized appreciation of $9.9 million on the Loan Portfolio and $5.4 million of net unrealized appreciation on the CLO Portfolio.  The primary driver for the increase in fair value of the Loan Portfolio was higher prices in the broadly syndicated U.S. loan market as a result of improved inflows and tightening yields during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The increase in fair value of the CLO Portfolio was a result of tightening spreads and increasing trades in CLO equity. 
  Income Taxes 
  We have elected be treated as a RIC for income tax purposes beginning with the date of our IPO. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements; additionally, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income, including net short term gains in excess of net long term losses. So long as we qualify as a RIC, we generally are not subject to the entity level taxes on earnings timely distributed to our stockholders.  At our discretion, we may delay distributions of a portion of our current year taxable income to the subsequent year and pay 4% excise taxes on such deferred distributions as calculated under the Code. If we anticipate paying excise taxes, we accrue excise taxes on a quarterly basis based on our estimates. 

41 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity and capital resources arise primarily from our Credit Facility and cash flows from operations. In addition, we may use proceeds from any follow-on equity offerings of common stock and other supplementary financing mechanisms as additional sources of capital and liquidity.  
  In order to qualify as a RIC, we must annually distribute in a timely manner to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable ordinary income.  In addition, we must also distribute in a timely manner to our stockholders all of our taxable ordinary and capital income in order to not be subject to income taxes.  Accordingly, our ability to retain earnings is limited.     
  Equity Capital 
  As a BDC, we are generally not able to issue or sell our common stock at a price below our net asset value per share, exclusive of any underwriting discount, except (i) with the prior approval of a majority of our stockholders, (ii) in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. As of   September 30, 2016  , our net asset value was   $13.20   per share and our closing market price was   $11.03   per share. 
  Debt Capital 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $100.0 million   in borrowings outstanding on our Credit Facility and our debt to equity ratio was   0.76x  . The fair value of assets pledged as collateral on our Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016   were   $174.3 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $39.7 million   of available liquidity consisting of   $4.7 million   of cash and cash equivalents and   $35.0 million   of available capacity on our Credit Facility.  
  As a BDC, we are permitted to issue  senior securities,  as defined in the 1940 Act, in any amount as long as immediately after such issuance our asset coverage is at least 200%, or equal to or greater than our asset coverage prior to such issuance, after taking into account the payment of debt with proceeds from such issuance. Asset coverage is defined in the 1940 Act as the ratio of the value of the total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness. However, if our asset coverage is below 200%, we may also borrow amounts up to 5% of our total assets for temporary purposes even if that would cause our asset coverage ratio to further decline.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, our asset coverage was   232%   and   207%  , respectively. 
  Operating and Financing Cash Flows 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $21.2 million   and was primarily due to net proceeds from the disposition of investments of $76.7 million and increase in payable for investments purchased of $1.6 million, offset by $59.3 million of investment purchases.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $18.9 million   and was used to reduce debt outstanding by $10.2 million and pay $8.7 million of distributions to stockholders.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by operating activities was $16.3 million and was primarily from the collection of interest on our investment portfolio and net proceeds from purchases and sales of investments.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , net cash used in financing activities was   $15.9 million   and was attributed to $10.6 million for distributions to stockholders and a net decrease in debt outstanding of $5.2 million.  
  Contractual Obligations 
  A summary of our contractual payment obligations as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not currently engage in off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  Distributions to Stockholders 
    When determining distributions to stockholders, our Board of Directors considers estimated taxable income, GAAP income and economic performance.  Actual taxable income may differ from GAAP income due to temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. The specific tax characteristics will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. We currently expect distributions to stockholders for 2016 to be from ordinary taxable income.  

42 

The table below details the distributions to stockholders declared on our shares of common stock since the completion of our IPO:  

We maintain an  opt out  dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan for our common stockholders.  As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they, or their nominees on their behalf, specifically  opt out  of the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan so as to receive cash distributions.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments, estimates and assumptions, which relate to the estimation of fair value of portfolio investments and revenue recognition.   
  Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
  We value our investments in accordance with the 1940 Act and Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ), as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. 

43 

We undertake a multi-step valuation process to determine the fair value of our investments in accordance with ASC 820. The valuation process begins with the development of a preliminary valuation recommendation for each investment as determined in accordance with our valuation policy by a group of our Manager s valuation, accounting and finance professionals, which is independent of our Manager's investment team.  To prepare the proposed valuation, the group reviews information provided by a nationally recognized independent pricing service, broker-dealers, and may consult with the investment team and other internal resources of our Manager and its affiliates. The preliminary valuation recommendations are then presented to the Investment Committee and reviewed and approved by our Audit and Compliance Committee.  The valuation recommendations are then reviewed by our Board of Directors for final approval.    There were no changes to our valuation techniques or to the types of unobservable inputs used in the valuation process compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. When available, we determine the fair value of our investments using unadjusted quoted prices from active markets. Where inputs for an asset or liability fall into more than one level in the fair value hierarchy, the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment's fair value measurement. We use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment when determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and out of levels as of the beginning of each reporting period. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below: 
  Level 1:     Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.     
  Level 2:     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This may include valuations based on executed trades, broker quotations that constitute an executable price, and alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs which, in each case, are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset in connection with market data at the measurement date.     
  Level 3:     Inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data. In certain cases, investments classified within Level 3 may include securities for which we have obtained indicative quotes from broker-dealers that do not necessarily represent prices the broker may be willing to trade on.    
    The valuation techniques used maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our Senior Floating Rate Loans are predominately valued based on evaluated prices from a nationally recognized independent pricing service or from third-party brokers who make markets in such debt investments. When possible, we make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand their use of significant inputs and assumptions. We review the third-party fair value estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range and dispersion of third-party estimates, frequency of pricing updates, comparison of recent trade activity for similar securities, and review for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date.    
  There may be instances when independent or third-party pricing sources are not available, or cases where we believe that the third-party pricing sources do not provide sufficient evidence to support a market participant's view of the fair value of the debt investment being valued. These instances may result from an investment in a less liquid loan such as a middle market loan, a mezzanine loan or unitranche loan, or a loan to a company that has become financially distressed. In these instances, we may estimate the fair value based on a combination of a market yield valuation methodology and evaluated pricing discussed above, or solely based on a market yield valuation methodology. Under the market yield valuation methodology, we estimate the fair value based on a discounted cash flow technique. For these debt investments, the unobservable inputs used in the market yield valuation methodology to measure fair value reflect management's best estimate of assumptions that would be used by market participants when pricing the investment in a hypothetical transaction, including estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date. We will estimate the remaining life based on market data for the average life of similar loans. However, if we have information that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term, we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date. The average life to be used to estimate the fair value of our loans may be shorter than the legal maturity of the loans since many loans are prepaid prior to the maturity date. The interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on current interest rate spreads of similar loans. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a loan, we may consider other factors that a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value, including the anticipated proceeds that would be received in a liquidation. 
  We estimate the fair value of our CLO equity investments using a combination of third-party broker quotes, purchases or sales of the same or similar securities, and cash flow forecasts subject to assumptions that a market participant would use regarding the investments' underlying collateral, including, but not limited to, assumptions for default and recovery rates, reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates. Cash flow forecasts are discounted using market participant's market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, third-party broker quotes, industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes,  

44 

if any, when determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance and other market indices. 
   Investment Income 
    For debt investments, we record interest income on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.  OID and purchased discounts and premiums are accreted into interest income using the effective interest method, where applicable.  Loan origination fees are deferred and accreted into interest income using the effective interest method.  We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when such amounts are received.  We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible.    
    Interest income on CLO equity investments is recognized using the effective interest method as required by FASB ASC Subtopic 325-40,   Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets   ( ASC 325-40 ). Under ASC 325-40, at the time of purchase, we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective yield of an investment based on these estimated cash flows and our cost basis. Subsequent to the purchase, these estimated cash flows are updated quarterly and a revised yield is calculated prospectively in accordance with ASC 320-10-35,   Investment-Debt and Equity Securities  . In the event that the fair value of an investment decreases below its current amortized cost basis, we may be required to write down the current amortized cost basis for a credit loss or to fair value depending on our hold expectations for the investment.  Current amortized cost basis less the amount of any write down ( Reference Amount ) is used to calculate the effective yield used for interest income recognition purposes over the remaining life of the investment.  We are precluded from reversing write downs for any subsequent increase in the expected cash flows of an investment with the effect of increasing total interest income over the life of the investment and increasing the realized loss recorded on the sale or redemption of the investment by the amount of the credit loss write down. In estimating these cash flows, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. These include the amount and timing of principal payments (including prepayments, repurchases, defaults and liquidations), the pass through or coupon rate, and interest rate fluctuations. In addition, interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying loans and the timing and magnitude of projected credit losses on the loans underlying the securities have to be estimated. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income.  As a result, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.    
   
  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our debt investments bore interest at floating rates, and we expect that our investment portfolio will, in the future, primarily include floating rate debt investments.  The interest rates on our debt investments are usually based on a floating LIBOR, and the debt investments typically contain interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates to current rates on a periodic basis.  As of   September 30, 2016  , 100% of the debt investments in our portfolio had interest rate floors between   0.75%   and   1.75%  , which, in the current interest rate environment where LIBOR is approximately 0.85%, has effectively converted most of those floating rate debt investments to fixed rate debt investments.  In contrast, our Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision with no LIBOR floor, and therefore, our cost of funds will fluctuate with changes in short-term interest rates.   
  Assuming no changes to our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  , the following table shows the approximate annualized impact to the components of our results of operations from hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates to our Loan Portfolio and debt financing.     

(1)    A decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rates, it does not reflect any potential impact to the fair value of our investments as a result of changes to interest rates, nor does it adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could affect the net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income.  Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above.  
  The above sensitivity analysis does not include our CLO equity investments.  CLO equity investments are levered structures that are collateralized primarily with first lien floating rate loans that may have LIBOR floors and are levered primarily with floating rate debt that does not have a LIBOR floor.  The residual cash flows available to the equity holders of the CLOs will  

45 

decline as interest rates increase until interest rates surpass the LIBOR floors on the floating rate loans.  However, the revenue recognized on our CLO equity investments is calculated using the effective interest method which incorporates a forward LIBOR curve in the projected cash flows.  Any change to interest rates that is not in-line with the forward LIBOR curve used in the projections, in either the timing or magnitude of the change, will cause actual distributions to differ from the current projections and will impact the related revenue recognized from these investments.   
  The below graph illustrates the forward LIBOR curve utilized in the projected cash flows from our CLO equity investments as of   September 30, 2016   (1)   .  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time, we may be a party to certain ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.  We are not currently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    You should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto before you decide to invest in ACSF.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance. 
  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially 
  adversely affected. If that happens, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which are not the only risks facing our Company. 
  Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
  Our Manager is expected to change as a result of a change in its ownership  
  Our Manager is an indirect subsidiary of a wholly-owned portfolio company of American Capital.  On May 23, 2016, American Capital announced that it had entered into a merger agreement (the  Merger Agreement ) with Ares Capital Corporation ( Ares Capital ), under which Ares Capital will acquire American Capital in a cash and stock transaction (the  Acquisition ), subject to each party s shareholder approval, customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.  In accordance with the 1940 Act and the terms of our management agreement with our Manager, the management agreement will automatically terminate upon consummation of the Acquisition as a result of the ultimate change in ownership of our Manager.  Under the Merger Agreement, American Capital agreed to cause our Manager to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as possible the approval of our Board of Directors and our shareholders of a new investment advisory contract with an affiliate of Ares Capital on substantially similar terms as the management agreement with our Manager and a temporary advisory contract with the affiliate of Ares Capital in the event that shareholder approval is not obtained prior to the closing of the Acquisition.  A process is under way involving the disinterested members of our Board of Directors reviewing such information as may be reasonably necessary for our Board of Directors to evaluate the terms of the proposed new investment advisory contract with Ares Capital s affiliate.  We cannot assure you that we will enter into a new investment advisory contract with an Ares Capital affiliate in connection with the Acquisition or that we will have continued access to the same senior management and/or key personnel.  Any change in our Manager could materially adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
