BUTTE HIGHLANDS MINING COMPANY  
  NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
   
 Butte Highlands Mining Company (hereinafter  Butte  or  the Company ) was incorporated in May 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of exploring and mining the Butte Highland s (Only Chance) Mine, south of Butte, Montana.  The Company was reorganized in October 1996 for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties.  As of the date of reorganization, stockholders representing approximately 76% of the outstanding capital stock could not be located.  In order to obtain the quorum necessary for the special meetings, the Company obtained an order from the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington appointing a trustee for the benefit of those stockholders which could not be located.   
   
 As of May 17, 2007 the Company had disposed of all of its historical mineral properties or claims, and began reporting as a shell company.  The Board of Directors intends to seek out an appropriate business opportunity and has not limited its search to any particular industry. Management believes it can identify opportunities in several sectors and will proceed with the appropriate diligence to create value for the shareholders. Operations are primarily conducted from the Company headquarters in Spokane, Washington. 
   
 The foregoing unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements furnished herein includes all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented.  Operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 This summary of significant accounting policies of Butte Highlands Mining Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements.  The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The Company's financial instruments as defined by ASC 825-10-50, include cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses.  All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at September 30, 2016. 
   
 The standards under ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
   
 Level 1.  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
   
 Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

BUTTE HIGHLANDS MINING COMPANY  
  NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

Level 3.  Unobservable inputs in which there is little of no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.  
   
 The Company did not have any assets measured at fair value other than cash at September 30, 2016. 
   
  Provision for Taxes  
 Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25  Income Taxes   Recognition .  Under the approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end.  A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the  more likely than not  standard imposed by ASC 740-10-25-5 to allow recognition of such an asset. See Note 5. 
   
  Reclassification  
   
 Certain amounts in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current period financial statements.  The reclassification had no effect on reported net losses, total assets or total equity. 
   
  NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
 The Company utilized office facilities provided by its president.  The value of the office facilities provided by the Company s president is nominal and immaterial to the financial statements, additionally the value of the services provided by the Company s president are nominal and immaterial to the financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 4   INCOME TAXES  
   
 Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25  Income Taxes   Recognition.   Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end.  A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the  more likely than not  standard imposed by ASC 740-10-25-5. 
   
 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. 
   
 Significant components of the deferred tax assets at an anticipated tax rate of 35% for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $212,600 which will begin to expire in the year 2032. The change in the allowance account from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was $12,900. 

BUTTE HIGHLANDS MINING COMPANY  
  NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

The Company has not identified any aggressive tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and the state of California. Further, the Company has no open tax years subject to audit prior to December 31, 2012. The Company is current on its federal tax returns. 
   
  NOTE 5   COMMON STOCK  
   
 During the period ending March 31, 2016 the Company identified 115,319 Class B shares that had previously been cancelled and re-issued as Class A shares.  The shares have been reclassified and all affected periods have been updated to reflect this change. 
   
  NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 The June 16, 2016 Letter of Intent between Butte Highlands and Interlok Key Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, as amended on July 15, 2016 and August 31, 2016 has been further amended on October 15, 2016 to provide that the parties shall use their best efforts to enter into a definitive Share Exchange Agreement no later than December 1, 2016. All other terms and conditions of the Letter of Intent remain unchanged.   The consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement will result in a change of control of the Company.  
   
 Other than as discussed above, there were no recognizable subsequent events for the period ended September 30, 2016. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date the financial statements were issued. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   
   Cautionary Statement   
   
 Some sections of this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations may contain forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance and underlying assumptions that are not statements of historical facts.  This document and any other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.  The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intends,   estimates,   forecast,   project  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements in this document are based upon various assumptions, and although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, and are difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.   Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which reflect management s view only as of the date of this report. 
   
   Business of Butte Highlands Mining Company   
   
 Butte Highlands Mining Company (hereinafter  Butte,   We  or  the Company ) was incorporated in May 1929 under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of exploring and mining the Butte Highland s (Only Chance) Mine, south of Butte, Montana. The Company is inactive, having sold the last of its mining claims in 2007. 
   
 We intend to acquire an interest in a business seeking the perceived advantages of a publicly registered corporation.  We will not restrict our search to any specific business or industry. We may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. The Company may seek a business opportunity with an entity which has recently commenced operations, wishes to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital to expand into new products or markets, develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes.  The Company may acquire assets and/or establish subsidiaries in various businesses, or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.  Business opportunities may be available in many different industries at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 
   
 Management of the Company, while not experienced in matters relating to the new direction of the Company, will rely primarily upon their own efforts to accomplish the business purposes.  The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the number of employees during the next 12 months. It is not anticipated that any outside consultants or advisors, other than the Company's legal counsel, will be utilized to effectuate its business purposes described herein. During the next twelve months, the Company expects to be able to satisfy its cash requirements, and does not foresee the need to raise additional capital during this period. 
   
 Effective July 6, 2009 the Company s Class A Common Stock was registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Effective April 29, 2010, our Class A Common Stock was listed for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.  Our trading symbol is  BTHI  

Result of Operations for period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the period ended September 30, 2015  
   
 During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $7,041 and $36,850 respectively compared to a net loss of $4,775 and $23,807 during the three month and nine month periods ended June 30, 2015.  This represents an increase in net loss in the amount of $ 2,266 over the respective three month period ended June 30, 2015 and an increase in net loss of $13,043 over the respective nine month period ended June 30, 2015. This increased in loss for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 is due primarily to an increase in professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 
   
 Total operating expenses increased to $7,041 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from $4,775 for the comparable period ended September 30, 2015.  This increase in loss is due primarily the timing of billing for professional fees for services provided during the period ending September 30, 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 The Company s working capital at September 30, 2016 was $61,751 compared to working capital of $98,603 at December 31, 2015. Working capital decreased primarily due to continuing operating expenses with no income and additional professional fees incurred in connection with the Share Exchange Agreement with Interlok Key Management Inc.  
   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $31,892 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared with $ 24,059 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Cash flow from investing activities was $0 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 Cash flow from financing activities was $0 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared with $0 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  
   
 As a result, cash decreased by $31,892 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The Company had cash of $70,926 as of September 30, 2016. It will not be necessary for the Company to raise additional capital to continue its business activities in 2016. 
   
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
   
 There are no preliminary agreements or understandings between the Company and its officers and directors or affiliates or lending institutions with respect to any loan agreements.        
   
    ITEM 3. QUANTATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 a)            Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 In connection with the preparation of this report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 b)            Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION  
   
 On June 16, 2016 Butte Highlands Mining Company ( Butte ) entered into a Letter of Intent ( LOI ) with Interlok Key Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, Butte will acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the Interests of INTERLOK (the  Acquisition ). The consideration for the Acquisition shall be the issuance by Butte Highlands to the INTERLOK members, including the shares issued to brokers and finders in connection with the Transaction, such number of shares of Butte Highlands as shall be equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the outstanding shares of Butte Highlands at closing. The parties agreed to use their best efforts to enter into a definitive Share Exchange Agreement no later than July 15, 2016. That date was revised to October 17, 2016 and subsequently revised to December  1, 2016. At closing, the current directors of Butte will serially resign and be replaced by persons nominated by the management of Interlok. 
   
  Interlok is engaged in the business of developing and licensing its patented key based encryption methods. The company was formed to develop and license a new approach to enhance the strength of today s key-based encryption methods through its patented Dynamic Synchronous Key Management technology.  Interlok s solutions are intended to increase the effectiveness of current encryption products. InterLok s unique design is also intended to prevent hacker attacks by providing perpetual authentication for communication sessions.    
   
  InterLok s technology does not directly displace existing products or services available in the market today. It enhances and adds new capabilities. Whether approaching security from a physical or human interactive perspective, Interlok s encryption method is intended to render data unavailable to unauthorized view or use.  Interlok s products assure that other solutions are strengthened against new code breaking advances.  
   
 At closing of the transaction contemplated by the LOI, Paul Hatfield, President and a Director of Butte shall be paid the sum of $55,000 for services in connection with this transaction. The fee is payable: $25,000 in cash and the balance in the form of 250,000 restricted shares of Butte Highlands Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Hatfield shall be awarded options to acquire an additional 350,000 shares of Butte Highlands Class A common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of Butte Highlands common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board as of the close of business on June 16, 2016, the date on which the Letter of Intent was fully executed.  The options, which will have piggy-back registration rights are exercisable for twenty-four months commencing on the closing of the transaction contemplated by the LOI.  
   
 In a related agreement, on June 20, 2016 Mr. Hatfield entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with JD McGraw, of Houston, Texas. Mr. McGraw was instrumental in negotiating the LOI. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. McGraw, or his assigns, has been granted the right to purchase from Paul Hatfield a maximum of Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) Shares at a price of $0.15 per share. The Stock Purchase Agreement is effective for a period of twenty-four (24) months commencing upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the LOI.
