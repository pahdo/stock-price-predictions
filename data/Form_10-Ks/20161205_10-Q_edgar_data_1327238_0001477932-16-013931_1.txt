As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our" and "our company" mean Compass Biotechnologies Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, unless otherwise indicated.      General Overview      We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on May 12, 2004 under the name Glass Wave Enterprises, Inc. Effective February 16, 2007, we changed our name to Cyplasin Biomedical Ltd. and effected a six point two (6.2) for one (1) forward stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. Following our incorporation, we commenced the business, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Astro Nutrition Inc., as a reseller of health products and herbal remedies. We targeted the market of health food supplements and herbal remedies by catering mainly to the European and Asian markets. We disposed of our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Astro Nutrition Inc. during our quarter ended July 31, 2007 and abandoned our business plan to focus on the identification of suitable businesses with which to enter into a business opportunity or business combination.     On February 1, 2007, we entered into an asset purchase agreement dated February 1, 2007 with Christian Petzelt. The asset purchase agreement contemplated our company acquiring certain intellectual property pertaining to cancer treatments, specifically protein molecules, for potential applications in treating various cancers in exchange for the issuance by our company of 21,000,000 shares of our common stock on a post six point two (6.2) for one (1) forward basis. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the asset purchase agreement and the acquisition of such intellectual property occurred on February 15, 2007.                 4       
      Table of Contents           As of the closing date of the asset purchase agreement on February 15, 2007, our company commenced the business of developing a novel therapeutic, recombinant protein called  Cyplasin . On April 10, 2007, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Bioxen Ltd., whereby we acquired a second Cyplasin patent describing a protein having anti tumor effect. Research into the Cyplasin protein structure has allowed us to manufacture the protein in the laboratory and develop procedures for the scale up in large-scale manufacturing processes as the discovery was to be commercialized. Additional patents were filed for these various processes and some have been issued in various jurisdictions.     Prior to the Cyplasin asset being vended into our company an aggregate of approximately $1.8 million had been spent on research and development related activities. These previous expenditures allowed for our company to anticipate the further development of the protein molecule from discovery and proof of concept stage to a clinical development stage.     On April 10, 2007, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Bioxen Ltd. to acquire certain intellectual property. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the asset purchase agreement and the acquisition of the intellectual property occurred on April 10, 2007. In accordance with the closing of the asset purchase agreement, we paid $100 to Bioxen in exchange for the acquisition by our company of such intellectual property.     During the last part of 2008 as we completed our preclinical testing and analysis of Cyplasin-SC , as a therapy for skin cancer and melanoma treatment it was determined the product would require additional product formulation work and additional funding would b e required in order to advance the potential product to human clinical studies. Due to the financial environment at the time and continuing forward we were not successful in being able to raise the required funds and subsequently we were unable to proceed with the Cyplasin product development on our own and started looking for strategic development partners or a sale of our company via a reverse takeover (RTO) event.     In order to prepare for such events, on December 23, 2008, we effected a forty (40) old for one (1) new reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital decreased from 465,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 11,625,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001and our issued and outstanding shares decreased from 39,584,000 shares of common stock to 989,600 shares of common stock. The reverse stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on February 2, 2009 under the stock symbol  CPBM .     Effective November 25, 2009, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Amendment, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 11,625,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares, par value of $0.001 per share; and an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation for the alteration of our authorized share capital to authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.001 per share, for which our directors may fix and determine the designations, rights, preferences or other variations of each class or series within each class of the shares of preferred stock.     On February 7, 2009, we entered into a licensing agreement with Bioxen for further development of the Cyplasin product. Under terms of the agreement, Bioxen received an exclusive license to further develop the Cyplasin product and commercialize the intellectual property and corresponding patents held by our company.     In consideration of the license granted, Bioxen agreed to pay our company a 0.5% royalty, calculated on all gross revenue of licensed products sold by Bioxen. In addition, Bioxen agreed to pay a non-refundable license fee of 25,000 EUR. This fee to be due within 30 days of the completion of any corporate financing by Bioxen, in which Bioxen receives a minimum collective amount of 500,000 EUR. Bioxen also agreed to pay all current outstanding patent amounts owed by our company and all ongoing, continued, and related patent and maintenance fees owed.                 5

In February 2011 we changed the name of our wholly owned private Canadian subsidiary from Cyplasin Oncoscience Inc., to C-Pharma Inc.     On March 29, 2011, we changed our name from Cyplasin Biomedical Ltd. to Compass Biotechnologies Inc., by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary Compass Biotechnologies Inc. which was formed solely for the purpose of the change of name. We changed our name to better reflect a new business direction for our company.

Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.      Our Current Business      Until our year ended January 31, 2009, we were a company focused on developing a novel therapeutic, recombinant protein called  Cyplasin . During the last part of 2008 and early 2009 as we completed our preclinical testing and analysis of Cyplasin-SC , as a therapy for skin cancer and melanoma treatment it was determined the product would require additional product formulation work and additional funding would be required in order to advance the potential product to human clinical studies. Subsequently it was determined that the project should not continue and in early 2010 we completed the transfer of the project back to Bioxen, the original owners of the IP.     In January 2010 we were assigned an exclusive worldwide license from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a technology based on using virus like particles (VLPs) to produce vaccines. The first license we decided to develop was to use the VLP technology to develop a vaccine for Hepatitis C. We also decided to develop generic products using different formulations off the off patent drugs Ribavirin and alpha interferon. These two drugs are the current standard of care for Hepatitis C and represent a global US$2 billion a year market.     In addition to these two generic drugs we became aware of other similar projects for drug development not related to Hepatitis C. Thus in February of 2011 we out-licensed the VLP vaccine project and the two Hepatitis C generic drugs to our wholly owned private Canadian subsidiary Cyplasin Oncoscience Inc and then renamed the Canadian subsidiary to C-Pharma Inc. to better reflect the subsidiary s corporate mission. C-Pharma is now charged with the development of the Hepatitis C products and also to expand the pipeline of products to develop a Hepatitis franchise.     This left our company to pursue the development of generic, biosimiliar and biobetter drug products. Generic drugs are duplicates of small molecule or chemical compounds and are well established in the pharmaceutical industry. Biosimiliars are protein drugs which are close duplicates of the originally marketed protein drug but are not exact replicas. The European Union and other countries have a regulatory approval process in place to allow these biosimiliar drugs to be marketed. The USA and Canada are expected to have a similar approval process in place shortly. Biobetter drugs use existing protein drugs and through modifications to these protein drugs add value and new intellectual properties. A "biobetter" is a biopharmaceutical product that is a copy of an existing product but is designed to have superior efficacy, safety, or improved drug delivery characteristics compared to the original product. Biobetter drugs are subject to full clinical trials but the cost, time and risk in getting them to market are lower; as the base component of the drug (the protein component) is already well known, characterized and accepted by regulatory agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Markets and their sizes are already established.                 8       
      Table of Contents          We are now focused on the development and commercialization of generic, biosimiliar and biobetter products. Our subsidiary, C-Pharma Inc., will continue to develop the Hepatitis C project our company was previously focused on.      Research and Development      We are a biotechnology development stage company and have not generated any revenues from our technologies. We believe, however, that there are opportunities to discover and develop effective and cost-effective treatments for the VLP technology licensed via the NIH for Hepatitis C. In addition to developing a vaccine for Hepatitis C, we anticipate to be able to develop generic Hepatitis C therapeutic drugs which we can market and generate revenue from. The focus of our company will be to develop protein based biosimiliar and biobetter drugs.     During our quarter ended October 31, 2011 we expended $58,469 on research and development costs, compared to $49,116 during the quarter ended October 31, 2010.      Intellectual property      We currently own and operate the registered internet domain  http://www.c-pharma.net/ . We rely on a combination of patents and licenses to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We intend to require our customers to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technologies or strategic plans, and it is our policy to enter into proprietary information agreements with employees and consultants. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as laws in the United States, Canada and Europe. In addition, our competitors may independently develop technologies similar to ours. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.     We currently have the rights to the following patents in the US and in Europe with other territories:      Patent(s) or Patent Application(s):     entitled "Synthesis and Purification of Hepatitis C Virus-Like particles" (PHS Ref. E-009-1997/0).           No assurance can be given that any patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications by us, or any future licensors, will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, that any of the provisional patent applications that have been or may be issued to us will be held valid if subsequently challenged or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the provisional patent applications and other proprietary rights held or licensed by us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products, duplicate any of our technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.                 9       
      Table of Contents          Our success will also depend in part on our ability to commercialize our technology without infringing the proprietary rights of others. While we have conducted freedom of use patent searches no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have an adverse affect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. If our technologies or subject matter are claimed under other existing United States or foreign patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology.     There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, may be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to either develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain such licenses may result in delays in marketing our proposed technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses, which may have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease our development and commercialization of our technology.      Results of Operations      As a result of a review of our company s significant transactions, in preparing for our three and nine month period ended October 31, 2011, we identified certain errors that have a significant impact on our previously issued financial information contained in our Forms 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2011.     In performing these reviews our company discovered that certain transactions were not properly accounted for. We have restated our financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2011, in order to record the following transactions in the correct fiscal period, with the result being a corresponding increase in our loss for the year.             Three month Summary ending October 31, 2011 and 2010                      Expenses   Our operating expenses for the three month periods ended October 31, 2011 and 2010 are outlined in the table below           Operating expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2011, increased as compared to the comparative period in 2010 primarily as a result of increased amortization, general and administrative expenses, management fees and research and development expenses.      Nine month Summary ending October 31, 2011 and 2010                    Expenses      Our operating expenses for the nine month periods ended October 31, 2011 and 2010 are outlined in the table below:           Operating expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2011, increased as compared to the comparative period in 2010 primarily as a result of increased amortization, general and administrative expenses, management fees and research and development expenses.      Revenue      We have not earned any revenues since our inception and we do not anticipate earning revenues in the upcoming quarter.             Equity Compensation      On March 31, 2007 our board of directors approved our 2007 stock option plan. Under the 2007 stock option plan, options may be granted only to our directors, officers, employees and consultants as determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to the stock option plan, we reserved for issuance 75,000 post split shares of our common stock.      Liquidity and Financial Condition                  As of October 31, 2011, our company had working capital deficit of $882,496. In the next twelve months we anticipate spending $360,000 on management fees, $250,000 on general and administrative expenses and $1,180,000 on research and development. Our cash on hand at October 31, 2011 was $94.00. We plan to raise additional capital required to meet immediate short- term needs and to meet the balance of our estimated funding requirements for the twelve months, primarily through the private placement of our securities.     We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.      Future Financings      We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately $1,790,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our ongoing operating expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations and to repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities.     We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.             Other than as described below, we presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.           Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on the annual financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2011, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.     As a result, there will also be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business will be dependent upon obtaining further financing and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of the stockholders who will be receiving our shares in the spin off. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.     There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. We intend to pursue various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long- term financial requirements, which we anticipate will consist of further private placements of our equity securities or shareholder loans. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due and we will be forced to further scale down or perhaps even cease operations.     As noted, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long -term financial requirements, which we anticipate will consist of further private placements of equity securities, advances from related parties or shareholder loans. We plan to rely on shareholder loans and private placements to meet our short term cash requirements. We have not entered into any definitive agreements with any shareholders or related parties for the provision of loans or advances. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, or generate significant material revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.      Contractual Obligations      As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.      Going Concern      We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or equity financing.             Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies       The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financialstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.      Basis of Presentation      The consolidated unaudited financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) and are expressed in US dollars. Our company s fiscal year end is January 31.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our company s actual results could differ from management s estimates and assumptions. Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the determination of impairment of intangibles and long lived assets, expected tax rates for future income tax recoveries and determining the fair values of financial instruments.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which is included in the ASC Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures). ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 also requires disclosures of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and a settlement within Level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of the adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on our company s consolidated financial statements.     In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, "Subsequent Events (Topic 855) Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements". The amendment eliminates the requirement for SEC filers to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. This standard had no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. Certain other recent accounting pronouncements have not been disclosed as they are not applicable to our company.     There are several new accounting pronouncements issued by FASB which are not yet effective. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by our company. Management does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on our company's financial position or operating results.               Item 3. Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures         Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely     decisions regarding required disclosure.     As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (also our principal executive officer, principal financial and accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance in the reliability of our reports as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended October 31, 2011 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       Much of the information included in this quarterly report includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". Such forward looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our business operations. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein.     Such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements" involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that important factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements".     Our common shares are considered speculative during the development of our new business operations. Prospective investors should consider carefully the risk factors set out below.       Risks Related to our Business        We have had negative cash flows from operations since inception. We will require significant additional financing, the availability of which cannot be assured, and if our company is unable to obtain such financing, our business may fail.      To date, we have had negative cash flows from operations and have depended on sales of our equity securities and debt financing to meet our cash requirements. Our ability to develop and, if warranted, commercialize our technologies, will be dependent upon our ability to raise significant additional financing. If we are unable to obtain such financing, we will not be able to fully develop our business. Specifically, we will need to raise additional funds to:                   support our planned growth and carry out our business plan;           continue scientific progress in our research and development programs;           address costs and timing of conducting clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals and patent prosecutions;           address competing technological and market developments; and           establish additional collaborative relationships.                We may not be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms as required. Even if financing is available, it may not be available on terms that are favourable to us or in sufficient amounts to satisfy our requirements. If we require, but are unable to obtain, additional financing in the future, we may be unable to implement our business plan and our growth strategies, respond to changing business or economic conditions, withstand adverse operating results and compete effectively. More importantly, if we are unable to raise further financing     when required, we may be forced to scale down our operations and our ability to generate revenues may be negatively affected.      We have a history of losses and nominal operating results, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.      Since February 15, 2007 (date of reporting as a development stage company), we have a net loss of $4,881,534. We can offer no assurance that we will operate profitably or that we will generate positive cash flow in the future. In addition, our operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not within our control, such as the level of competition and general economic conditions.     Our company's operations will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. No assurance can be given that we may be able to operate on a profitable basis.     Due to the nature of our business and the early stage of our development, our securities must be considered highly speculative. We have not realized a profit from our operations to date and there is little likelihood that we will realize any profits in the short or medium term. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful commercialization or licensing of our core technology, which itself is subject to numerous risks.     We expect to continue to incur development costs and operating costs. Consequently, we expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flows until our technology gains market acceptance sufficient to generate a sustainable level of income from the commercialization or licensing of our technology.      Our inability to complete our product development activities successfully may severely limit our ability to operate and finance operations.      Commercialization of our core technology will require significant additional research and development as well as substantial clinical trials. We believe that the United States will be the principal market for our technology, as will any country in the world where the need for anti cancer therapeutics, initially for skin cancer and melanomas, exists. We may not be able to successfully complete development of our core technology, or successfully market our technology. We, and any of our potential collaborators, may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval and intellectual property rights of our technology. Our research and development programs may not be successful. Our core technology may not prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials, and we may not obtain the intended regulatory approvals for our core technology. Whether or not any of these events occur, we may not have adequate resources to continue operations for the period required to resolve the issue delaying commercialization and we may not be able to raise capital to finance our continued operation during the period required for resolution of that issue.             We may lose our competitiveness if we are not able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights against infringement, and any related litigation may be time-consuming and costly  .     Our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. If any of our competitors copy or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or develop similar technologies independently, we may not be able to compete as effectively. The measures we have implemented to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights are currently based upon a combination of patents and trade secrets. This, however, may not be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and our other intellectual property rights. Further, the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual property rights. We may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, may result in substantial costs and a diversion of our company's resources. In addition, notwithstanding our rights to our intellectual property, other persons may bring claims against us alleging that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights or claims that our intellectual property rights are not valid. Any claims against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate, divert our attention and resources, result in the loss of goodwill associated with our business or require us to make changes to our technology.      Our company may become subject to intellectual property litigation which may harm our business.      Our success depends in part on our ability to develop commercially viable products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Although we have not been subject to any filed infringement claims, other patents could exist or could be filed which may prohibit or limit our ability to market our products or maintain a competitive position. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. Intellectual property litigation may divert management's attention from developing our technology and may force us to incur substantial costs regardless of whether we are successful. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, and force us to curtail or cease the development and commercialization of our technology.      If our company commercializes or tests our technology, our company will be subject to potential product liability claims which may affect our earnings and financial condition.      We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our core technology during research and development efforts, including clinical trials, or after commercialization, results in adverse affects. As a result, we may incur significant product liability exposure, which may exceed any insurance coverage that we obtain in the future. Even if we elect to purchase such issuance in the future, we may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance at reasonable cost and/or reasonable terms. Excessive insurance costs or uninsured claims may increase our operating loss and affect our financial condition.      If we fail to effectively manage the growth of our company and the commercialization or licensing of our technology, our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained.      As we proceed with the development of our technology and the expansion of our marketing and commercialization efforts, we expect to experience significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business. We will need to add staff to manage operations, handle business development efforts and perform finance and accounting functions. We anticipate that we will be required to hire a broad range of additional personnel in order to successfully advance our operations. This growth is likely to place a strain on our management and operational resources. The failure to develop and implement effective systems, or to hire and retain sufficient personnel for the performance of all of the functions necessary to effectively service and manage our potential business, or the failure to manage growth effectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.              Failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals will severely limit our ability to commercialize our technology.      We believe that it is important for the success of our business to obtain the approval of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States (FDA) before we commence commercialization of our technology in the United States, the principal market for our technology. We may also be required to obtain additional approvals from foreign regulatory authorities to apply for any sales activities we may carry out in those jurisdictions. If we cannot demonstrate the safety, reliability and efficacy of our technology, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could delay or withhold regulatory approval of our technology.     Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our technology, that approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Even after granting regulatory approval, the FDA and other regulatory agencies and governments in other countries will continue to review and inspect any future marketed products as well as any manufacturing facilities that we may establish in the future. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or facility may result in restrictions on the product, including a withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, governmental regulatory agencies may establish additional regulations which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our technology.      Even if we obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our products, lack of commercial acceptance may impair our business.      Our product development efforts are primarily directed toward obtaining regulatory approval for our Hepatitis C product treatments. Our products may not be employed in all potential applications being investigated, and any reduction in applications may limit the market acceptance of our products and our potential revenues. As a result, even if our products are developed into marketable products and we obtain all required regulatory approvals, we cannot be certain that our products will be adopted at a level that would allow us to operate profitably.      If we do not keep pace with our competitors, technological advancements and market changes, our technology may become obsolete and our business may suffer.      The market for our technology is very competitive, is subject to rapid technological changes and varies for different individual products. We believe that there are potentially many competitive approaches being pursued that compete with our technology, including some by private companies for which information is difficult to obtain.     Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and have developed products and processes that directly compete with our technology. Our competitors may develop, or may in the future develop, new technologies that directly compete with our technology or even render our technology obsolete. Our technology is designed to develop a topical treatment for skin cancer and melanoma. Even if we are able to demonstrate improved or equivalent results from our technology, researchers and practitioners may not use our technology and we may suffer a competitive disadvantage. Finally, to the extent that others develop new technologies that address the targeted application for our current technology, our business will suffer.             Our ability to hire and retain key personnel will be an important factor in the success of our business and a failure to hire and retain key personnel may result in our inability to manage and implement our business plan.      We are highly dependent upon our management personnel such as the loss of the services of one or more of our management may impair management's ability to operate our company. We have not purchased key man insurance on any of these individuals, which insurance would provide us with insurance proceeds in the event of their death. Without key man insurance, we may not have the financial resources to develop or maintain our business until we could replace the individual or to replace any business lost by the death of that person. The competition for qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate is intense. In addition, in order to manage growth effectively, we must implement management systems and recruit and train new employees. We may not be able to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain or to hire qualified personnel as required, we may not be able to adequately manage and implement our business.      Most of our assets and all of our directors and officers are outside the United States, with the result that it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or any of our directors or officers.      Although we are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada, United States, our principal business office is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Outside the United States, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments against us that are obtained in the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon civil liability provisions of federal securities laws. In addition, a majority of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and nearly all of the assets of these persons and our assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to affect service of process within the United States upon such persons or to enforce against us or such persons judgments predicated upon the liability provisions of United States securities laws. There is substantial doubt as to the enforceability against us or any of our directors and officers located outside the United States in original actions or in actions of enforcement of judgments of United States courts or liabilities predicated on the civil liability provisions of United States federal securities laws. In addition, as the majority of our assets are located outside of the United States, it may be difficult to enforce United States bankruptcy proceedings against us. Under bankruptcy laws in the United States, courts typically have jurisdiction over a debtor's property, wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. Courts outside of the United States may not recognize the United States bankruptcy court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have trouble administering a United States bankruptcy case involving a Nevada company as debtor with most of its property located outside the United States. Any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court obtained by you in the United States may not be enforceable.      Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and any change in such regulation may have a material adverse effect on our company.      There is no assurance that the laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction, will not be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business. The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on our company. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our operations.              Risks Related to our Common Stock        A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations  .     A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations has been and will be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.     The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.      If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing shareholders.      Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares will result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.      Trading of our stock may be restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission's penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.      The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.              The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.      In addition to the "penny stock" rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.      Our common stock is illiquid and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors which are unrelated to our operations .     Our common stock currently trades on a limited basis on the OTC Bulletin Board. Trading of our stock through the OTC Bulletin Board is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in the stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.       Other Risks        Trends, Risks and Uncertainties      We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.       Item 2.
