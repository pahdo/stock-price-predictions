  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  UNAUDITED 

1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation.   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fossil Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries (the  Company ). 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s financial position as of   October 1, 2016  , and the results of operations for the thirteen-week periods ended   October 1, 2016   (   Third   Quarter ) and   October 3, 2015   ( Prior Year Quarter ), respectively, and the thirty-nine week periods ended   October 1, 2016   ( Year To Date Period ) and   October 3, 2015   ( Prior Year YTD Period ). All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. 
  These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). Operating results for the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the full fiscal year. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company has not made any changes in its significant accounting policies from those disclosed in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Business.   The Company is     a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Its principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, the Company has a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which its products are marketed. The Company's products are distributed globally through various distribution channels, including wholesale in countries where it has a physical presence, direct to the consumer through its retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where the Company does not maintain a physical presence. The Company's products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of its customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on its extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, the Company is able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. 
  Hedging Instruments.   The Company is exposed to certain market risks relating to foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company actively monitors and attempts to manage these exposures using derivative instruments including   foreign exchange forward contracts   ("  forward contracts  ") and interest rate swaps. The Company s foreign subsidiaries periodically enter into   forward contracts   to hedge the future payment of intercompany inventory transactions denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward contracts to manage fluctuations in Japanese yen exchange rates that will be used to settle future third-party inventory component purchases by a U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiary. If the Company was to settle its euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and U.S dollar   forward contracts   as of   October 1, 2016  , the result would have been a net gain of approximately   $3.6 million  , net of taxes. This unrealized gain is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes on the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Additionally, to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the cash flows being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts would be recognized in other income (expense)-net on the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Also, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in interest expense in the period in which the payment is settled. To reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates adversely affecting the Company s investment in foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries, the Company periodically enters into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses from net investment hedges are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income (loss), and will be reclassified into earnings in the event the Company's underlying investments are liquidated or disposed. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative  
  
   6 

purposes. See  Note 10 Derivatives and Risk Management  for additional disclosures about the Company s use of derivatives. 
  Operating expenses.   Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) and restructuring charges. SG A expenses include selling and distribution expenses primarily consisting of sales and distribution labor costs, sales distribution center and warehouse facility costs, depreciation expense related to sales distribution and warehouse facilities, the four-wall operating costs of the Company s retail stores, point-of-sale expenses, advertising expenses and art, design and product development labor costs. SG A also includes general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of administrative support labor and  back office  or support costs such as treasury, legal, information services, accounting, internal audit, human resources, executive management costs and costs associated with stock-based compensation.     Restructuring charges include costs to reorganize, refine and optimize the Company s infrastructure and store closures.  
  Earnings Per Share ( EPS ).   Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS adjusts basic EPS for the effects of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during each period using the treasury stock method. 
  The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the computations of both basic and diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share data): 

Approximately   1.6   million,   1.5 million  ,   0.6 million   and   0.5 million   weighted shares issuable under stock-based awards were not included in the diluted EPS calculation at the end of the   Third   Quarter, Year To Date Period, Prior Year Quarter, and Prior Year YTD Period, respectively, because they were antidilutive. Approximately   1.1 million   weighted performance shares were not included in the diluted EPS calculation at the end of the Third Quarter and Year to Date Period as the performance targets were not met. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards.   In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ). ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2016-16. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows     (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice with respect to these items. ASU 2016-05 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. This standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of  
  
   7 

cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2016-09, but the adoption may create volatility in the Company's effective tax rate.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04,   Liabilities Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20)- Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products   ( ASU 2016-04 ). ASU 2016-04 entitles a company to derecognize amounts related to expected breakage to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur. ASU 2016-04 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2016-04. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification    ( ASU 2016-02 ), which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting,   Leases (Topic 840)  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and modifies accounting, presentation and disclosure for both lessors and lessees. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Many of the Company s leases are considered operating leases and are not capitalized under ASC 840. Under ASC 842 the majority of these leases will qualify for capitalization and will result in the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities once the new standard is adopted.  The Company is in the process of reviewing lease contracts to determine the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 affects reporting entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out or average cost. Specifically, ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ), to provide guidance on management s responsibility to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. This standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The new revenue standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows either a full retrospective adoption to all periods presented or a modified retrospective adoption approach with the cumulative effect of initial application of the revised guidance recognized at the date of initial application. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ).  ASU 2016-08 is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ). ASU 2016-10     clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ). ASU 2016-12 clarifies three aspects of Topic 606, including the objective of the collectability criterion, the measurement date for noncash consideration and the requirements for a completed contract. ASU 2016-12 also includes a practical expedient for contract modifications. Additionally, the amendments allow an entity to exclude all sales taxes collected from customers from the transaction price. The Company expects to identify similar performance obligations under ASC 606 as compared to current guidance under ASC 605. As a result, we expect the timing of our revenue recognition to remain substantially unchanged.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.   In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the following provisions, which had no material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, were adopted effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2016:  
     ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
             
    ASU 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period 

2. ACQUISITIONS AND GOODWILL 
  Fossil Spain Acquisition.      On August 10, 2012, the Company s joint venture company, Fossil, S.L. ( Fossil Spain ), entered into a Framework Agreement (the  Framework Agreement ) with several related and unrelated parties, including General De Relojeria, S.A. ( General De Relojeria ), the Company s joint venture partner. Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, Fossil Spain was granted the right to acquire the outstanding   50%   of its shares owned by General De Relojeria upon the expiration of the joint venture agreement on December 31, 2015. The Company completed the acquisition of these shares in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, at which time Fossil Spain became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, the fixed and previously remaining variable components of the purchase price were settled in the amounts of   4.3 million   euros (approximately   $4.8 million   as of the settlement date) and   3.5 million   euros (approximately   $3.9 million   as of the settlement date), respectively. As of January 1, 2013, pursuant to the Framework Agreement, the Company assumed control over the board of directors and the day-to-day management of Fossil Spain, and began consolidating Fossil Spain, instead of treating it as an equity method investment. 
  Misfit, Inc. Acquisition.      On December 22, 2015, the Company acquired Misfit, Inc. ("Misfit"), an innovator and distributor of wearable technology and stylish connected devices. Misfit was a U.S.-based, privately held company. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to acquire a scalable technology platform that can be integrated across the Company's multi-brand portfolio, a native wearable technology brand and a pipeline of innovative products. Misfit s position in the wearable technology space combined with their software and hardware engineering teams enables the Company to expand its addressable market with new distribution channels, products, brands and enterprise partnerships. 
  The purchase price was   $215.4 million   in cash, net of cash acquired and subject to working capital adjustments, and   $1.7 million   in replacement awards attributable to precombination service. At closing,   $12.5 million   of the cash payment was placed into an escrow fund for the Company for working capital adjustments and indemnification obligations of the seller incurred within 12 months from the closing date.  The Company received   $0.8 million   from the escrow during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 as a working capital settlement and has recorded a receivable for additional claims incurred. To fund the cash purchase price, the Company utilized cash on hand and approximately   $60 million   of availability under its   $1.05 billion   revolving line of credit. The results of Misfit's operations have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements since December 22, 2015.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, while transaction costs of   $8.4 million   associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Because the total purchase price exceeded the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, goodwill was recorded equal to the difference. The element of goodwill that is not separable into identifiable intangible assets represents expected synergies. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the preliminary estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of December 22, 2015, the effective date of the acquisition (in thousands): 

Purchase accounting adjustments during the Year To Date Period include a   $5.9 million   reduction to inventories,   $4.0 million   increase to current liabilities,   $3.8 million   reduction to total transaction consideration,   $3.7 million   reduction to long-term liabilities,   $3.6 million   increase to goodwill and a   $1.2 million   reduction to accounts receivable. The amounts shown above may change in the near term as management continues to assess the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. A change in this valuation may also impact the income tax related accounts and goodwill. The goodwill recognized from the acquisition has an indefinite useful life and will be included in the Company s annual impairment testing. 
  Goodwill.     The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows (in thousands): 

__________________________________________________________________________________ 
  (1) All goodwill resulting from the Misfit acquisition was recorded in the Americas segment as of January 2, 2016, on a preliminary basis.  This line item includes an allocation of the goodwill across reporting segments and also purchase accounting adjustments made during the Year To Date Period.

3. INVENTORIES 
  Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): 

4. WARRANTY LIABILITIES 
  The Company s warranty liability is recorded in accrued expenses-other in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Warranty liability activity consisted of the following (in thousands): 

_______________________________________________ 
  (1) Changes in cost estimates related to preexisting warranties are aggregated with accruals for new standard warranties issued and foreign currency changes. 

5. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s income tax expense and related effective rates were as follows (in thousands, except percentage data): 

The higher effective tax rate in the Third Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter is primarily attributable to favorable differences between the income tax returns filed and the tax provisions made for those tax liabilities. These differences were recorded as discrete items in the Prior Year Quarter that more than offset the higher structural rate. The higher effective tax rate in the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period is primarily attributable to the recognition of income tax benefits due to the settlement of audits and favorable differences between the income tax returns filed and the tax provisions made for those tax liabilities in the Prior Year YTD Period that more than offset the higher structural rate.  The lower projected structural rate for 2016 is largely due to the projected shift in earnings mix towards foreign income which is taxed at lower statutory rates. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was   $22.2 million  , of which   $19.5 million   would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods, if recognized. The Company is subject to examinations in various state and foreign jurisdictions for its 2009-2015 tax years, none of which the Company believes are significant, individually or in the aggregate. Tax audit outcomes and timing of tax audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. 
  The Company has classified uncertain tax positions as long-term income taxes payable, unless such amounts are expected to be paid within twelve months of the condensed consolidated balance sheet date. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had recorded   $0.5 million   of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for positions that are expected to be settled within the next twelve months. Consistent with its past practice, the Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax overpayments and income tax underpayments in income tax expense and income taxes receivable/payable. At  
  
   11 

October 1, 2016  , the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet was   $2.1 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. For the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, the Company accrued income tax-related interest expense of   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 

6. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Common Stock Repurchase Programs.   Purchases of the Company s common stock are made from time to time pursuant to its repurchase programs, subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through the open market. Repurchased shares of common stock are recorded at cost and become authorized but unissued shares which may be issued in the future for general corporate or other purposes. The Company may terminate or limit its stock repurchase program at any time. In the event the repurchased shares are canceled, the Company accounts for retirements by allocating the repurchase price to common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The repurchase price allocation is based upon the equity contribution associated with historical issuances. The repurchase programs are conducted pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. 
  During the Year to Date period, the Company effectively retired   0.1 million   shares of common stock repurchased under its repurchase programs. The effective retirement of repurchased common stock decreased common stock by   $1,100  , additional paid-in capital by   $0.2 million  , retained earnings by   $5.0 million   and treasury stock by   $5.2 million  . At   January 2, 2016   and   October 1, 2016  , all treasury stock had been effectively retired. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   $824.2 million   of repurchase authorizations remaining under its combined repurchase programs. However, under the Company's First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"), the Company is restricted from making open market repurchases of its common stock. See "Note 14 Debt Activity" for additional disclosures about the First Amendment.  
  The following tables reflect the Company s common stock repurchase activity for the periods indicated (in millions):

9. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company reports segment information based on the  management approach . The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company s reportable segments. 
  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company s reportable operating segments are comprised of (i) Americas, (ii) Europe and (iii) Asia. Each reportable operating segment includes sales to wholesale and distributor customers, and sales through Company-owned retail stores and e-commerce activities based on the location of the selling entity. The Americas segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Canada, Latin America and the United States. The Europe segment primarily includes sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. The Asia segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products and services. 
  The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the selling entity. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Global strategic initiatives such as brand building and omni channel activities and general corporate expenses, including certain administrative, legal, accounting, technology support costs, equity compensation costs, payroll costs attributable to executive management, brand management, product development, art, creative/product design, marketing, strategy, compliance and back office supply chain expenses are not allocated to the various segments because they are managed at the corporate level internally. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

10. DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
  Cash Flow Hedges.   The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are the fluctuations in global currencies that will ultimately be used by non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries to settle future payments of intercompany inventory transactions denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, the Company projects future intercompany purchases by its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries generally over a period of up to   24 months  . The Company enters into   forward contracts  , generally for up to   85%   of the forecasted purchases, to manage fluctuations in global currencies that will ultimately be used to settle such U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward contracts to manage fluctuations in Japanese yen exchange rates that will be used to settle future third-party inventory component purchases by a U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiary.   Forward contracts   represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon settlement date and exchange rate. These   forward contracts   are designated as single cash flow hedges. Fluctuations in exchange rates will either increase or decrease the Company s U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows from these inventory transactions, which will affect the Company s U.S. dollar earnings. Gains or losses on the   forward contracts   are expected to offset these fluctuations to the extent the cash flows are hedged by the   forward contracts  .  
  These   forward contracts   meet the criteria for hedge accounting, which requires that they represent foreign currency-denominated forecasted transactions in which (i) the operating unit that has the foreign currency exposure is a party to the hedging instrument and (ii) the hedged transaction is denominated in a currency other than the hedging unit s functional currency. 
  At the inception of each forward contract designated as a cash flow hedge, the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness under the critical terms matched method at inception and at least quarterly throughout the life of the hedging relationship. If the critical terms (i.e., amounts, currencies and settlement dates) of the forward contract match the terms of the forecasted transaction, the Company concludes that the hedge is effective. 
  For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, the Company s hedges resulted in no ineffectiveness in the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, and there were no components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for the   Third   Quarter, Prior Year Quarter, Year To Date Period or Prior Year YTD Period. 
  All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the equity section of the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet until such derivative s gains or losses become realized or the cash flow hedge relationship is terminated. If the cash flow hedge relationship is terminated, the derivative s gains or losses that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows occur. However, for cash flow hedges that are terminated because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur in the original specified time period, the derivative s gains or losses are immediately recognized in earnings. There were no gains or losses reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges in the   Third   Quarter, Prior Year Quarter, Year To Date Period or Prior Year YTD Period. Hedge accounting is discontinued if it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective. The Company records all forward contract hedge assets and liabilities on a gross basis as they do not meet the balance sheet netting criteria because the Company does not have master netting agreements established with the derivative counterparties that would allow for net settlement. 
  
   18 

As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding   forward contracts   designated as cash flow hedges that were entered into to hedge the future payments of inventory transactions (in millions): 

The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its outstanding debt. To manage the interest rate risk related to its   $231.3 million   U.S.-based term loan (as amended and restated on March 9, 2015, the "Term Loan ), the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 26, 2013 with a term of approximately   five years  . The objective of this hedge is to offset the variability of future payments associated with interest rates on the Term Loan. The interest rate swap agreement hedges the   1-month London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") based variable rate   debt obligations under the Term Loan. Under the terms of the swap, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of   1.288%   per annum to the swap counterparty plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Company s consolidated leverage ratio (the  Ratio ) from   1.50%   if the Ratio is less than   1.00   to   1.00  , to   2.75%   if the Ratio is greater than or equal to   3.00   to   1.00  ). The notional amount amortizes over the remaining life of the Term Loan to coincide with repayments on the underlying loan. The Company receives interest from the swap counterparty at a variable rate based on 1-month LIBOR. This hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge. 
  Net Investment Hedges.   The Company is also exposed to risk that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact its net investment in foreign operations. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into a forward contract designated as a net investment hedge to reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on   45.0 million   euros of its total investment in a wholly-owned, euro-denominated foreign subsidiary. The hedge was settled during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 resulting in a net gain of   $0.5 million   net of taxes that was recognized in the currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
  The effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the ineffectiveness of net investment hedges. Should any portion of a net investment hedge become ineffective, the ineffective portion will be reclassified to other income (expense)-net on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will not be reclassified into earnings until the Company s underlying investment is liquidated or dissolved. 
  Non-designated Hedges.   The Company also periodically enters into   forward contracts   to manage exchange rate risks associated with certain intercompany transactions and for which the Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had non-designated   forward contracts   of approximately   $2.0 million   on   28.0 million   rand associated with a South African rand-denominated foreign subsidiary. Changes in the fair value of derivatives, not designated as hedging instruments, are recognized in earnings when they occur.

At the end of the   Third   Quarter, the Company had   forward contracts   designated as cash flow hedges with maturities extending through September 2018. As of   October 1, 2016  , an estimated net gain of   $3.1 million   is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates. See  Note 1 Financial Statement Policies  for additional disclosures on foreign currency hedging instruments. 

11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820,   Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ), establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 
     Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
     Level 2   Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. 
     Level 3   Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assumptions. 
  ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. 
  The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 1, 2016   (in thousands): 

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   January 2, 2016   (in thousands): 

22 

The fair values of the Company s deferred compensation plan assets are based on quoted prices. The deferred compensation plan assets are recorded in intangible and other assets-net in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the Company s   forward contracts   are based on published quotations of spot currency rates and forward points, which are converted into implied forward currency rates. The fair values of the interest rate swap assets and liabilities are determined using valuation models based on market observable inputs, including forward curves, mid-market price and volatility levels. See  Note 10 Derivatives and Risk Management  for additional disclosures about the interest rate swaps and   forward contracts  . 
  The Company has evaluated its short-term and long-term debt as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016   and believes, based on the interest rates, related terms and maturities, that the fair values of such instruments approximated their carrying amounts. As of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these accounts. 
  In accordance with the provisions of ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  , property, plant and equipment-net with a carrying amount of   $13.1 million   related to retail store leasehold improvements and fixturing was written down to a fair value of   $0.6 million  , and related key money in the amount of   $2.0 million   was deemed not recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge of   $14.5 million   during the Year To Date Period. 
  The fair values of assets related to Company-owned retail stores were determined using Level 3 inputs. Of the   $14.5 million   impairment expense,   $10.3 million  ,   $1.6 million   and   $0.4 million   were recorded in restructuring charges in the Americas, Europe, and Asia segments, respectively, and   $2.2 million   was recorded in SG A in the Europe segment. 

23 

12. INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS 
    
  The following table summarizes intangible and other assets (in thousands): 

Key money is the amount of funds paid to a landlord or tenant to acquire the rights of tenancy under a commercial property lease for a certain property. Key money represents the  right to lease  with an automatic right of renewal. This right can be subsequently sold by the Company or can be recovered should the landlord refuse to allow the automatic right of renewal to be exercised. Key money is amortized over the initial lease term, which ranges from approximately   four   to   18 years  . 
  Amortization expense for intangible assets was approximately   $3.7 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   Third   Quarter and Prior Year Quarter, respectively, and   $11.2 million   and   $3.7 million   for the Year To Date Period and Prior Year YTD Period, respectively. Estimated aggregate future amortization expense by fiscal year for intangible assets is as follows (in thousands): 

24 

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Litigation.   The Company is occasionally subject to litigation or other legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any currently pending legal matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on the business or financial condition of the Company. 
    Sale-leaseback.   During the Third Quarter, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback agreement for its approximately   518,000   square foot warehouse and distribution center in Dallas, Texas.  The sales price was   $33.0 million  . The transaction resulted in a gain of   $6.7 million   net of taxes and fees in the Third Quarter and a deferred gain of   $13.2 million   to be amortized to rent expense over the initial lease term. The leaseback has a   10  -year term with   two     5  -year renewal options and is classified as an operating lease.  As of October 1, 2016, the estimated future minimum lease payments under the lease were as follows (in thousands):   

14. DEBT ACTIVITY 
  On August 8, 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment. The First Amendment adds two new levels to the applicable margin pricing grid used to calculate the interest rate that is applicable to base rate loans and LIBOR rate loans under the Company s credit facility and increases the applicable margin at each pricing level for LIBOR rate loans by   25   basis points and for base rate loans by   25   basis points. Additionally, the First Amendment provides for the net cash proceeds from certain debt issuances by the Company in excess of   $25.0 million   to be applied, first, to prepay the term loans under the Company s credit facility and, for the excess, if any, to prepay the revolving credit loans under the Company s credit facility with a corresponding reduction in the revolving credit commitment by the amount of such excess proceeds. The First Amendment also modifies the negative covenant on restricted payments set forth in the credit facility in such a manner as to prohibit the Company's ability to make open market repurchases of the Company's common stock. Furthermore, the First Amendment changes the consolidated total leverage ratio that the Company must comply with for fiscal quarters ending on or after June 30, 2016 from   2.50  :1.00 to   3.25  :1.00.  
  In connection with the First Amendment, the Company and certain of its material domestic subsidiaries entered into a Collateral Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Company and such subsidiaries granted liens on all or substantially all of their assets in order to secure the Company s obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated March 9, 2015 (as amended, restated or otherwise modified, including pursuant to the First Amendment, the  Credit Agreement ) and the other loan documents (the  Obligations ). Additionally, certain of the Company s domestic subsidiaries entered into a Guaranty Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which such subsidiaries guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations. 
  The Company made principal payments of   $6.3 million   and   $15.6 million   under its Term Loan during the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, respectively. The Company also made net payments of   $3.0 million   and   $67.0 million   under its U.S. revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Credit Facility") during the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, respectively. Borrowings were primarily used to fund capital expenditures, normal operating expenses and stock repurchases and were more than offset by payments on debt. Amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had available borrowing capacity of   $299.7 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was favorably impacted by a   $176.8 million   international cash balance. The Company incurred approximately   $1.7 million   and   $4.9 million   of interest expense related to the Term Loan during the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, respectively, including the impact of the related interest rate swap. The Company incurred  
  
   25 

approximately   $4.1 million   and   $11.5 million   of interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility during the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, respectively. The Company incurred approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.2 million   of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs during the   Third   Quarter and Year To Date Period, respectively.  
   
  15. RESTRUCTURING 
  The Company implemented a multi-year restructuring program in the Third Quarter to reinvent the Company, strengthen the foundation of the Company for the future and support long-term sales growth and profitability objectives.  The program is intended to touch all aspects of the business, enhance operating capabilities, create greater efficiencies and take advantage of the Company's considerable scale. The Company will review and adjust its overall structure with the goal of streamlining the Company's ability to respond to the changing needs and demands of customers, and will examine and adjust its store fleet to reflect the evolving shopping habits of today's consumer. The Company is in the early phases of the program, although the Company estimates total restructuring charges of up to approximately   $150.0 million   will be recorded predominantly during fiscal years 2017 and 2018, with some charges recognized in the current fiscal year. The costs incurred in the Third Quarter include professional services and costs related to store closures. The following tables show a rollforward of the liability incurred for the Company s restructuring plan (in thousands):

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Fossil Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries for the   thirteen   and thirty-nine week periods ended   October 1, 2016   (the    Third   Quarter  and  Year To Date Period,  respectively) as compared to the   thirteen   and thirty-nine week periods ended   October 3, 2015   (the  Prior Year Quarter  and  Prior Year YTD Period,  respectively). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. 
  General 
  We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men s and women s fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels, including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. 
  Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL        website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon.com, Dillard s, JCPenney, Kohl s, Macy s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the United States, our network of Company-owned stores included 99 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 142 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of   October 1, 2016  . In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website,   www.fossil.com  , as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. 
  Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in approximately   150   countries worldwide through   23   Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately   80   independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 236 retail stores and 133 outlet stores as of   October 1, 2016  . Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. 
  Our business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war and military action both in the U.S. and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to procure our products from manufacturers for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products. 
  Our business is also subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contract manufacturers  control. 
  Future sales and earnings growth are also contingent upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner while continuing to develop innovative products in the respective markets in which we compete. As is typical with new products, including our lines of connected accessories, market acceptance of new designs and products that we may introduce is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. We believe that we can drive long-term growth with brand building, innovation through design, fashion and new materials and introducing new technology and functionality into our accessories, while continuing to provide a solid value proposition to consumers across all of our brands. 
  The majority of our products are sold at retail price points ranging from $85 to $600. We believe that the price/value relationship and the differentiation and innovation of our products, in comparison to those of our competitors, will allow us to maintain or grow our market share in those markets in which we compete. Historically, during recessionary periods, the  
  
   28 

strength of our balance sheet, our strong operating cash flow and the relative size of our business with our wholesale customers, in comparison to that of our competitors, have allowed us to weather recessionary periods for longer periods of time and generally resulted in market share gains to us. 
  Our international operations are subject to many risks, including foreign currency fluctuations and risks related to the global economy. Generally, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of other countries in which we operate will reduce the translated amounts of sales and operating expenses of our subsidiaries, which results in a reduction of our consolidated operating income. We manage these currency risks by using derivative instruments. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are the future payments by non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries of intercompany inventory transactions denominated in U.S. dollars. We enter into   foreign exchange forward contracts   ("  forward contracts  ") to manage fluctuations in global currencies that will ultimately be used to settle such U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. We are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt, which we manage with an interest rate swap. 
  For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . 

Results of Operations 
  Executive Summary.   During the   Third   Quarter, net sales   decreased     4%  , as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, with minimal overall sales impact due to currency. Although we continued to face headwinds in the traditional watch category, we performed well against our strategic objectives which we believe have the ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and improved profitability. The advances we are making in these areas of our business give us confidence that we have the appropriate long-term strategies in place.  
  During the Third Quarter, sales of     FOSSIL branded products were flat (increased 1% in constant currency) during the Third Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, driven by growth in Asia and Europe offset by declines in the Americas. Watches in particular performed well, largely due to the launch of our media campaign behind our second-generation Fossil Q products. Increases in FOSSIL branded watch sales were offset by declines in jewelry and leathers.  Sales of our SKAGEN branded products increased 9% (8% in constant currency) as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, including growth in all major product categories with a particularly strong performance in watches. Sales of SKAGEN branded product in Europe and Asia offset a decline in the Americas. We believe the positive performance of FOSSIL and SKAGEN branded watches in the continually challenging retail environment validates our strategies and investments to grow the brands.   
  Our multi-brand global watch portfolio decreased 2% (same in constant currency) during the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. We experienced growth in our newer brands, KATE SPADE NEW YORK        and TORY BURCH       , which was more than offset by decreases by nearly all of the other brands in our portfolio. The wholesale channel continues to be challenging, particularly in the traditional watch market.  The watch portfolio benefited from the launch of MICHAEL KORS ACCESS.  The new line of wearables was supported by a strong marketing campaign from the brand, and so far, sales have exceeded our expectations.  In less than one year, we have fully integrated our Misfit acquisition into our organization, leveraged their platform and deployed new technology and functionality into selected owned and licensed brands, with more to launch for the holiday season during the fourth quarter. We are focused on the wearable technology opportunities across all of the product categories. We believe these new products represent the future for fashion accessories and that our capabilities and strategic advantages provide us with the best opportunity to succeed in the category. 
  The following table presents as reported and constant currency net sales percentage change information by brand for the Third Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter:  

Global comparable store sales decreased 3% during the   Third   Quarter as positive comparable store sales in Asia were offset by declines in the Americas, while Europe was flat. Globally, our Fossil brand outlets outperformed our full-price stores, which also put some additional pressure on our margins.  Our relatively stronger outlet performance was driven by deeper promotions and easier year-over-year comparable store sales comparisons. Fossil Q continued to perform well in our full-priced  
  
   29 

stores, though that performance was more than offset by declines in both traditional watches and leathers.  Traffic continues to be challenging in our retail channel as double-digit traffic declines continue to pressure performance. However, we are improving conversion through the continued investments in digital marketing and omni-channel capabilities including our Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") initiatives. While a small part of our direct-to-consumer business, our e-commerce sales increased nearly 50% in the Third Quarter compared to the Prior Year Quarter.   
  The growing interest in connected accessories, and our early success in the space, reinforce our plans to deploy our resources behind this category and our most compelling growth opportunities. We have begun working on a new multi-year restructuring plan, focused on our growth opportunities, including connected accessories, and improving overall profitability.  While it is early in the process, we envision a comprehensive plan that will evolve our model and the way we work, the way we develop product and the way we bring our products to market.  We expect the program will touch all aspects of our business as we enhance our operational capabilities, gain greater efficiencies and take optimal advantage of our considerable scale.  We will review and adjust our overall structure with the goal of streamlining the way we work to respond to the changing needs and demands of our customers.  Additionally, we will examine and adjust our store fleet to reflect the evolving shopping habits of today s consumer.  Our goal is to, over time, improve our financial performance and build an improved operating platform that is nimble and responsive and will be in a position to drive long term shareholder value.   
  During the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, gross profit decreased primarily driven by lower sales     due to continuing headwinds in the traditional watch category. The gross margin rate also declined, mainly as a result of promotional activity in our outlets to drive sales. Wearables, which currently have lower margins than traditional watches, also negatively affected margins, along with an increased mix of off-price sales in the wholesale channel. Additionally, the gross margin rate included an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 40 basis points. Increased operating expenses for the   Third   Quarter were driven by restructuring expenses partially offset by gains from real estate sales.  Excluding those items, operating expenses were slightly higher than the Prior Year Quarter due to Misfit purchase accounting related costs, as lower core infrastructure expenses offset investments to build our wearables infrastructure. Additionally, other income decreased as we had fewer gains on foreign currency contracts during the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter.  During the   Third   Quarter, our financial performance, including the unfavorable impacts of currencies, resulted in earnings of   $0.36   per diluted share. 
  Constant Currency Financial Information 
  As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.  
  As a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), the following discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.  We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable. 

Quarterly Periods Ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015    
  Consolidated Net Sales.   Net sales   decreased     $33.3 million   or   4.3%   (3.8% in constant currency), for the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. Global watch sales   decreased     $13.8 million   or   2.4%   (1.9% in constant currency), while our leathers products   decreased     $11.5 million   or   11.0%   (10.5% in constant currency) driven by decreases in FOSSIL.  During the   Third   Quarter, our jewelry business   decreased     $6.8 million   or   10.1%   (8.9% in constant currency). 
  
   30 

Net sales information by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

In the   Third   Quarter, the translation of foreign-based net sales into U.S. dollars   decreased   reported net sales by approximately   $3.9 million  , including   unfavorable   impacts of   $7.0 million   and   $1.2 million   in our Europe and Americas segments, respectively, partially offset by favorable impacts of   $4.3 million   in Asia compared to the Prior Year Quarter. 
  The following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment (dollars in millions): 

Americas Net Sales.   Americas net sales   decreased     $30.0 million   or   7.7%   (7.4% in constant currency), during the   Third   Quarter in comparison to the Prior Year Quarter, driven by traditional watches and leathers. During the   Third   Quarter, our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $13.3 million or 4.6% (4.2% in constant currency), while our leathers business decreased $12.0 million or 16.9% (16.9% in constant currency) and our jewelry category decreased $3.5 million or 13.5% (13.4% in constant currency). During the   Third   Quarter, FOSSIL, KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH brands continued to deliver solid increases in watches that were offset by declines in nearly all of the other brands in the portfolio, although our MICHAEL KORS wearable launch did drive an improved trend for the brand.  While watches were down in the Third Quarter, we did observe sequential year-over-year improvement from the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, with improved sell-in in our wholesale business due to our launch of new wearable product.  In our traditional watch category, sell-out trends at wholesale took a modest step down, although U.S. department store trends remained stable.  Comparable store sales declined in the region as modest positive comparable store sales in Canada were more than offset by negative comparable store sales in the U.S. 
  The following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): 

31 

Europe Net Sales  .   Europe net sales   decreased     $17.1 million   or   6.6%   (3.9% in constant currency), led by a decline in watches and jewelry and to a lesser extent leathers, during the   Third   Quarter in comparison to the Prior Year Quarter. Our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $9.9 million or 5.2% (2.4% in constant currency), while our jewelry category decreased $5.3 million or 13.5% (11.7% in constant currency) and our leathers business decreased $1.3 million or 6.0% (2.4% in constant currency) in the   Third   Quarter. Within the region, growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN was offset by a decline in nearly all of the brands in the licensed portfolio with the exception of KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH. Modest growth in the Middle East and Eastern European markets was offset by declines in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. We experienced a modest decline in sell-through for traditional watches in some key markets in the wholesale channel. Comparable stores were flat, with positive comparable store sales in our outlets offsetting declines in our owned full-priced stores.  
  The following table sets forth product net sales for the Europe segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): 

Asia Net Sales.   Net sales in Asia   increased     $13.8 million   or   11.5%   (7.9% in constant currency). The increase was driven by watches, followed by growth in jewelry and leathers. Constant currency growth in South Korea, India and China was partially offset by a decline in Japan. During the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, our watch category increased $9.2 million or 8.9% (5.4% in constant currency), our jewelry category increased $2.1 million or 123.5% (128.4% in constant currency) and leathers increased $1.8 million or 14.5% (11.8% in constant currency). Comparable store sales in the region increased modestly with positive comparable store sales in both our owned outlet and full-price concepts. 
  The following table sets forth product net sales for the Asia segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): 

The following table sets forth the number of stores by concept on the dates indicated below: 

32 

During the   Third   Quarter, we opened five new stores and closed ten stores.  
  A store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable store sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.  
  Gross Profit.   Gross profit of   $385.1 million   in the   Third   Quarter   decreased     7.8%   in comparison to   $417.7 million   in the Prior Year Quarter driven by lower sales primarily due to continuing headwinds in the traditional watch category. Gross profit margin rate   decreased     200   basis points to   52.2%   in the   Third   Quarter compared to   54.2%   in the Prior Year Quarter. The gross margin rate declined mainly as a result of promotional activity in our outlets to drive sales. Wearables, which currently have lower margins than traditional watches, also negatively affected margins, along with an increased mix of off-price sales in the wholesale channel. Additionally, the gross margin rate included an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 40 basis points.  
  Operating Expenses.   Total operating expenses in the   Third   Quarter   increased   by   $11.9 million   or   3.5%   to   $353.9 million   compared to   $342.0 million   in the Prior Year Quarter.  Restructuring costs of $14.5 million in Third Quarter were partially offset by a $10.0 million gain from real estate sales. Increases in wearables infrastructure and Misfit purchase accounting related expenses were partially offset by lower core infrastructure costs.  Marketing expenses declined slightly due to timing, as we moved some planned investments into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The translation of foreign-denominated expenses during the   Third   Quarter decreased operating expenses by approximately $1.2 million as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses   increased     370   basis points to   48.0%   in the   Third   Quarter as compared to   44.3%   in the Prior Year Quarter.  
  Consolidated Operating Income.   Operating income   decreased   to   $31.2 million   in the   Third   Quarter as compared to   $75.7 million   in the Prior Year Quarter, driven by decreased sales and gross margin rate. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin   decreased   to   4.2%   in the   Third   Quarter compared to   9.8%   in the Prior Year Quarter and included a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies.  
  During the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter, the positive impact of currencies on sales in Asia was more than offset by currency headwinds in Europe and the Americas. On a constant currency basis, sales and gross profit decreased in the Americas and Europe and increased in Asia. Promotions to drive business in our outlets continued to be the most significant gross profit margin headwind across all segments. Gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by wearables, where margins are currently lower than traditional watches and an increased mix of off-price sales in the wholesale channel in the Americas. In the Third Quarter, total operating expenses increased compared to the Prior Year Quarter, with increased restructuring costs across all segments and Misfit purchase accounting related costs and increased wearables infrastructure expenses in our corporate costs. These expenses were partially offset by the benefit from real estate sales in the Americas and Europe. 
  Operating income by segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Interest Expense.   Interest expense   increased   by   $1.9 million   during the   Third   Quarter as a result of higher interest rate spreads due to our higher leverage ratio and amended credit facility. 
  Other Income (Expense)-Net.   During the   Third   Quarter, other income (expense)-net   decreased   by   $5.2 million   to   $1.6 million   in comparison to the Prior Year Quarter. This change was primarily driven by lower net foreign currency gains resulting from mark-to-market hedging and other transactional activities as compared to the Prior Year Quarter. 
  Provision for Income Taxes  .   Income tax expense for the   Third   Quarter was   $6.5 million  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   25.0%  . For the Prior Year Quarter, income tax expense was   $17.3 million  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   22.3%  . The   higher   effective tax rate in the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter was primarily attributable to favorable differences between the income tax returns filed and the tax provisions made for those tax liabilities.  These  
  
   33 

differences were recorded as discrete items in the Prior Year Quarter that more than offset the higher structural rate. The lower projected structural rate for 2016 is largely due to the projected shift in earnings mix towards foreign income which is taxed at lower statutory rates. 
  Net Income Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc.     Third   Quarter net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc.   decreased   to   $17.4 million  , or   $0.36   per diluted share, in comparison to   $57.5 million  , or   $1.19   per diluted share, in the Prior Year Quarter.     Diluted earnings per share in the   Third   Quarter as compared to the Prior Year Quarter included a $0.17 decrease due to increased restructuring costs. The translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and less net foreign currency gains resulting from mark-to-market hedging and other transactional activities decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.15. Diluted earnings per share was also unfavorably impacted by a $0.09 per diluted share decrease due to the amortization of acquired Misfit intangible assets and of related contingent equity grants. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $0.16 favorable impact to diluted earnings per share due to the sale of real estate. 

Fiscal Year To Date Periods Ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015    
  Consolidated Net Sales.   Net sales   decreased     $153.2 million   or   6.9%   (5.6% in constant currency), for the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. Global watch sales   decreased     $127.5 million   or   7.5%   (6.2% in constant currency). Our jewelry product category   decreased     $14.1 million   or   7.6%   (6.4% in constant currency), while our leathers category   decreased     $8.1 million   or   2.8%   (1.4% in constant currency), during the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. Global comparable store sales decreased 3.2% in our owned retail stores, with positive comparable store sales results in Europe and Asia more than offset by a decline in the Americas. Comparable store sales declined in all major product categories. 
  Net sales information by product category is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

In the Year To Date Period, the translation of foreign-based net sales into U.S. dollars decreased reported net sales by approximately   $27.1 million  , including unfavorable impacts of   $14.1 million  ,   $9.6 million   and   $3.4 million  , in our Europe, Americas and Asia segments, respectively. 
  The following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment (dollars in millions): 

Americas Net Sales.   For the Year To Date Period, Americas net sales   decreased     $101.7 million   or   8.9%   (8.1% in constant currency), compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. Sales performance in the Year To Date Period was principally driven by sales declines in watches of $73.8 million or 8.6% (7.7% in constant currency). Our leathers and jewelry categories also declined $16.1 million or 8.4% (7.8% in constant currency) and $7.8 million or 10.9% (10.4% in constant currency), respectively. Comparable store sales decreased moderately in our owned retail stores during the Year To Date Period.

The following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): 

Europe Net Sales  .   For the Year To Date Period, Europe net sales   decreased     $53.4 million   or   7.4%   (5.4% in constant currency), compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. The sales performance was driven by a $45.2 million or 8.5% decrease in watches (6.5% in constant currency) and a $10.1 million or 9.3% decrease in jewelry (7.9% in constant currency) while our leathers business increased $2.8 million or 5.0% (8.0% in constant currency). Comparable store sales increased slightly in our owned retail stores during the Year To Date Period.  
  The following table sets forth product net sales for the Europe segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions): 

Asia Net Sales.   For the Year To Date Period, Asia net sales   increased     $1.9 million   or   0.5%   (1.4% in constant currency), compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. The sales performance was principally driven by a $5.2 million or 13.3% increase in our leathers category (16.0% in constant currency) and a $3.8 million or 70.4% increase in jewelry (72.0% in constant currency), partially offset by a $8.6 million or 2.7% decrease in watches (1.9% in constant currency). Comparable store sales in the region increased slightly in our owned retail stores. 
  The following table sets forth product net sales for the Asia segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions):

Gross Profit.   For the Year To Date Period, gross profit margin   decreased     260   basis points to   52.3%   compared to   54.9%   in the Prior Year YTD Period. The   decreased   gross profit margin was primarily driven by the same factors impacting the Third Quarter, including an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 90 basis points. 
  Operating Expenses.   For the Year To Date Period, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales   increased   to   49.4%   compared to   45.9%   in the Prior Year YTD Period.  Increased restructuring costs were partially offset by real estate sales. Increases in wearables infrastructure and Misfit purchase accounting related costs were partially offset by reduced store expenses and lower core infrastructure expenses. The Year To Date Period included a $9.9 million favorable impact from the translation of foreign-based expenses into U.S. dollars.  
  Consolidated Operating Income.   Operating income   decreased   by   $141.3 million  , or   69.8%  , in the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin   decreased   to   2.9%   in the Year To Date Period as compared to   9.0%   in the Prior Year YTD Period and was negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies. 
  During the Year To Date Period, sales and gross margins were negatively impacted by currencies in all regional segments as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period. During the Year To Date Period, gross profit margin was negatively impacted by promotional activities to drive retail sales in our outlets in all geographies and an increased mix of sales in the Americas wholesale off-price channel to manage inventory levels. These unfavorable impacts to gross profit margin were partially offset by a favorable impact from our pricing initiatives. During the Year To Date Period, operating expenses deleveraged in the Americas and Europe segments largely due to fixed expenses on lower sales.  
  During the Year To Date Period, the translation of foreign-based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars decreased operating income by approximately $24.5 million. Operating income by segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):  

Interest Expense.   Interest expense   increased   by   $5.1 million   during the Year To Date Period as a result of higher interest rate spreads due to our higher leverage ratio and amended credit facility. 
  Other Income (Expense)-Net.   During the Year To Date Period, other income (expense)-net   decreased   by   $21.9 million   to   $6.4 million   in comparison to the Prior Year YTD Period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net foreign currency hedging gains in the Year To Date Period compared to the Prior Year YTD Period, and the non-recurrence of a $5.2 million gain recorded in the Prior Year YTD Period related to an interest rate hedge settlement. 
  Provision for Income Taxes  .   Income tax expense for the Year To Date Period was   $13.2 million  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   27.5%  . For the Prior Year YTD Period, income tax expense was   $58.7 million  , resulting in an effective income tax rate of   27.1%  . The   higher   effective tax rate in the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period was primarily attributable to the recognition of income tax benefits due to the settlement of audits and favorable differences between the income tax returns filed and the tax provisions made for those tax liabilities in the Prior Year YTD Period that more than offset the higher structural rate. The lower projected structural rate for 2016 is largely due to the projected shift in earnings mix towards foreign income which is taxed at lower statutory rates. 
  Net Income Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc.   Year To Date Period net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc.   decreased   by   80.6%   to   $29.2 million  , or   $0.60   per diluted share, in comparison to   $150.3 million  , or   $3.06   per diluted share, in the Prior Year YTD Period. Diluted earnings per share in the Year To Date Period as compared to the Prior Year YTD Period decreased $0.63 due to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and less net foreign currency gains resulting from mark-to-market hedging and other transactional activities. Diluted earnings per share was also unfavorably impacted by a $0.29 per diluted share decrease due to the amortization of acquired Misfit intangible assets and of related contingent equity grants. Partially offsetting these decreases were a $0.16 favorable impact to diluted earnings per share due to the sale of real estate and a $0.12 favorable impact to diluted earnings per share due to decreased restructuring costs. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  
   36 

Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures and strategic investments such as acquisitions. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the   Third   Quarter was   $236.0 million  , including $231.9 million held in banks outside the U.S., in comparison to cash and cash equivalents of   $301.6 million   at the end of the Prior Year Quarter and   $289.3 million   at the end of fiscal year   2015  . We believe cash from operating activities as well as amounts available under our U.S. credit facilities are sufficient to meet our cash needs in the U.S. for the next 12 months. 
  For the Year to Date Period, we generated operating cash flow of   $59.4 million  . This operating cash flow combined with cash on hand and funds generated from real estate sales was utilized to fund $83.6 million in net repayments on our credit facilities and   $53.5 million   of capital expenditures. Cash flows provided by operations consisted primarily of net income of   $34.8 million   adjusted by net non-cash expenses of   $73.8 million  , partially offset by a net increase of   $49.2 million   in working capital items. 
  Accounts receivable, net of allowances,   decreased   by   2.8%   to   $321.3 million   at the end of the   Third   Quarter compared to   $330.4 million   at the end of the Prior Year Quarter. Days sales outstanding for our wholesale businesses for the   Third   Quarter remained relatively constant at 53 days compared to 52 days in the Prior Year Quarter. 
  Inventory at the end of the   Third   Quarter was   $699.6 million  , which represented a   6.3%     decrease   from the end of the Prior Year Quarter ending inventory balance of   $746.3 million  . 
  The following tables reflect our common stock repurchase activity under our repurchase programs for the periods indicated (in millions): 

__________________________________________________________________________________ 
  (1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company completed this repurchase plan. 
  We effectively retired   0.1 million   shares of common stock repurchased under our repurchase plans during the Year to Date Period. We account for the retirements by allocating the repurchase price, which is based upon the equity contribution associated with historical issuances, to common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The effective retirement of common stock repurchased during the Year to Date Period decreased common stock by approximately   $1,100  , additional paid-in capital by   $0.2 million  , retained earnings by   $5.0 million   and treasury stock by   $5.2 million  . We effectively retired   2.7 million   shares of our common stock during the Prior Year YTD Period that was repurchased under our repurchase programs.     The effective retirement of common stock repurchased during the Prior Year YTD Period decreased common stock by approximately   $27,300  , additional paid-in capital by   $0.7 million  , retained earnings by   $228.8 million   and treasury stock by   $229.5 million  . At   January 2, 2016   and   October 1, 2016  , all treasury stock had been effectively retired. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had a total of   $824.2 million   of repurchase authorizations remaining under our combined repurchase programs. However, under our First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment"), we are restricted from making open market repurchases of its common stock.  
  
   37 

At the end of the   Third   Quarter, we had working capital of   $1.0 billion   compared to working capital of   $1.1 billion   at the end of the Prior Year Quarter. Additionally, at the end of the   Third   Quarter, we had approximately   $26.4 million   of short-term borrowings and   $697.4 million   in long-term debt. 
  On March 9, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for (i) revolving credit loans in the amount of $1.05 billion (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), with an up to $20.0 million subfacility for swingline loans (the  Swingline Loan ), and an up to $10.0 million subfacility for letters of credit, and (ii) a term loan in the amount of $231.3 million (the  Term Loan ). The Credit Agreement expires and is due and payable on May 17, 2018. The Credit Agreement amended and restated that certain credit agreement, dated as of May 17, 2013, as amended (the  Prior Agreement ). 
  On August 8, 2016, we entered into the First Amendment. The First Amendment adds two new levels to the applicable margin pricing grid used to calculate the interest rate that is applicable to base rate loans and LIBOR rate loans under the credit facility and increases the applicable margin at each pricing level for LIBOR rate loans by 25 basis points and for base rate loans by 25 basis points. Additionally, the First Amendment provides for the net cash proceeds from certain debt issuances in excess of $25.0 million to be applied, first, to prepay the term loans under our credit facility and, for the excess, if any, to prepay the revolving credit loans under our credit facility with a corresponding reduction in the revolving credit commitment by the amount of such excess proceeds. Furthermore, the First Amendment changes the consolidated total leverage ratio that we must comply with for fiscal quarters ending on or after June 30, 2016 from 2.50:1.00 to 3.25:1.00.  
  In connection with the First Amendment, we, along with certain of our material domestic subsidiaries, entered into a Collateral Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which, together with such subsidiaries, we granted liens on all or substantially all of their assets in order to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents (the  Obligations ). Additionally, certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a Guaranty Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which such subsidiaries guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations. 
  As of August 8, 2016, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at (i) the base rate (defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (c) London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of one month plus 1.0%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies, based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio, from 0.50%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 1.75%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies, based upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, from 1.50%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 2.75%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00).  
  Amounts outstanding under the Swingline Loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin. Interest based upon the base rate is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest based upon the LIBOR rate is payable on the last day of the applicable interest period. 
  Financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require us to maintain (i) a consolidated total leverage ratio no greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio no less than 3.50 to 1.00. 
  During the Year to Date Period, we made principal payments of   $15.6 million   under the Term Loan. Additionally, we had net principal payments of   $67.0 million   under the Revolving Credit Facility at an average annual interest rate of 2.20%. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had   $200.0 million   and   $522.0 million   outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. As of   October 1, 2016   we also had unamortized debt issuance costs, which reduce the corresponding debt liability, of   $4.5 million  . In addition, we had $0.9 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at   October 1, 2016  . Amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had   $299.7 million   in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was favorably impacted by a   $176.8 million   international cash balance. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were mainly used to fund capital expenditures, normal operating expenses and common stock repurchases. At   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to all our credit facilities. 
  For fiscal year   2016  , we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $65 million to $70 million. Of this amount, we expect approximately 65% will be for strategic growth, including investments in omni-channel, global concessions and technology, approximately 20% will be for retail store expansion and renovation and approximately 15% will be for technology and facilities maintenance. Our capital expenditure budget and allocation of it to the foregoing investments are estimates and are subject to change. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available  
  
   38 

under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  During the Third Quarter, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback agreement for its approximately 518,000 square foot warehouse and distribution center in Dallas, Texas.  The leaseback has a 10-year term with two 5-year renewal options and is classified as an operating lease.  The following table identifies the contractual obligations associated with the sale-leaseback as of   October 1, 2016   (in thousands):   

There were no material changes to our contractual obligations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  , other than noted above. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there were no material changes to our off balance sheet arrangements as set forth in commitments and contingencies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  , except as disclosed in Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation reserves and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in  Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . 

Forward-Looking Statements 
  The statements contained and incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expected financial position, results of operations, business and financing plans found in this  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The words  may,   believes,   expects,   plans,   intends,   estimates,   anticipates  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

   39 

In addition to the factors listed above, our actual results may differ materially due to the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risks and uncertainties set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 2, 2016  . Accordingly, readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should consider these facts in evaluating the information and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency risk relates to the euro and, to a lesser extent, the   British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso and Australian dollar   as compared to the U.S. dollar. Due to our vertical nature whereby a significant portion of goods are sourced from our owned entities, we face foreign currency risks related to the necessary current settlement of intercompany inventory transactions. We employ a variety of operating practices to manage these market risks relative to foreign currency exchange rate changes and, where deemed appropriate, utilize   forward contracts  . These operating practices include, among others, our ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars at spot rates and to maintain U.S. dollar pricing relative to sales of our products to certain distributors located outside the U.S. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward contracts to manage fluctuations in Japanese yen exchange rates that will be used to settle future third-party inventory component purchases by a U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiary. The use of   forward contracts   allows us to offset exposure to rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. We use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and do not use them for speculation or for trading. There were no significant changes in how we managed foreign currency transactional exposure in the   Third   Quarter, and management does not anticipate any significant changes in such exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposure in the near future. 
  We are exposed to risk that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our net investment in foreign operations. To manage this risk, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we entered into a forward contract designated as a net investment hedge to reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on 45.0 million euros of our total investment in a euro-denominated foreign subsidiary. The hedge was settled during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, resulting in a net gain of $0.5 million net of taxes that was recognized in the currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
  The following table shows our outstanding   forward contracts   designated as cash flow hedges for inventory transactions (in millions) at   October 1, 2016   and their expiration dates. 

If we were to settle our euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and U.S. dollar based   forward contracts   hedging inventory transactions as of   October 1, 2016  , the net result would have been a net gain of approximately $3.6 million, net of taxes. As of   October 1, 2016  , a 10% unfavorable change in the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies to which we have balance sheet transactional exposures would have decreased net pre-tax income by $11.0 million. The translation of the balance sheets of our foreign-based operations from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of   October 1, 2016  , a 10% unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the foreign currencies to which we have exposure would have reduced consolidated stockholders' equity by approximately $64.7 million. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  
   40 

We are subject to interest rate volatility with regard to debt borrowings. Effective July 26, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a term of approximately five years to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our Term Loan. We will continue to evaluate our interest rate exposure and the use of interest rate swaps in future periods to mitigate our risk associated with adverse fluctuations in interest rates. 
  Based on our variable-rate debt outstanding as of   October 1, 2016  , excluding the   $200.0 million   outstanding under our Term Loan hedged with an interest rate swap agreement, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $5.3 million. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  ( Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective as of   October 1, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   Third   Quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   41 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  There are no legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which our properties are subject, other than routine litigation incidental to our business, which is not material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  The following table shows our common stock repurchases based on settlement date for the fiscal quarter: 
  ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

_______________________________________________ 
  (1)                      During the   Third   Quarter, 182 shares of repurchased common stock were acquired from grantees in connection with income tax withholding obligations arising from vesting of restricted stock grants. These shares were not part of our publicly announced program to repurchase shares of common stock. 
  (2)                      In November 2014, we announced a common stock repurchase program pursuant to which $1.0 billion could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. This $1.0 billion repurchase program has a termination date of December 2018. In addition, we have a $30.0 million common stock repurchase program with no termination date.

Each Revolving Credit Loan by a Revolving Credit Lender shall be in a principal amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans requested on such occasion.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Credit Loans hereunder until the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. 
  Section 2.2        Swingline Loans  .

(b)        Refunding  . 
  (i)        Swingline Loans shall be refunded by the Revolving Credit Lenders on demand by the Swingline Lender.  Such refundings shall be made by the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages and shall thereafter be reflected as Revolving Credit Loans of the Revolving Credit Lenders on the books and records of the Administrative Agent.  Each Revolving Credit Lender shall fund its respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of Revolving Credit Loans as required to repay Swingline Loans outstanding to the Swingline Lender upon demand by the Swingline Lender but in no event later than 1:00 p.m. on the next succeeding Business Day after such demand is made.

  (ii)        The Borrower shall pay to the Swingline Lender on demand the amount of such Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received from the Revolving Credit Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full the outstanding Swingline Loans requested or required to be refunded.  In addition, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge any account maintained by the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (up to the amount available therein) in order to immediately pay the Swingline Lender the amount of such Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received from the Revolving Credit Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full the outstanding Swingline Loans requested or required to be refunded.

Further, each Revolving Credit Lender agrees and acknowledges that if, prior to the refunding of any outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section, one of the events described in   Section 12.1(i)   or   (j)   shall have occurred, each Revolving Credit Lender will, on the date the applicable Revolving Credit Loan would have been made, purchase an undivided participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be refunded in an amount equal to its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loan.  Each Revolving Credit Lender will immediately transfer to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation, and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will deliver to such Revolving Credit Lender a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount.  Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Revolving Credit Lender s participating interest in a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its participating interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Credit Lender s participating interest was outstanding and funded).

If the Borrower fails to specify a type of Loan in a Notice of Borrowing, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans in any such Notice of Borrowing, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

Subject to   Section 5.7   hereof, the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to disburse the portion of the proceeds of any Revolving Credit Loan requested pursuant to this Section to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender has not made available to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Loan.

Business Days before each date of prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Loan, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Rate Loans, Base Rate Loans, Swingline Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender.  If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date set forth in such notice.  Partial prepayments shall be, except for mandatory prepayments required under   Section 2.4(b)   or   Section 4.4(b)  , in an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof with respect to Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans), $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans and $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof with respect to Swingline Loans.

  (d)        Other Mandatory Prepayments  .  Upon the occurrence of any event triggering the prepayment requirement (i) under   Section 4.4(b)(i)   or   4.4(b)(ii)   and in the event the Borrower elects not to prepay Term Loans pursuant to   Section 4.4(b)   or if proceeds remain after the prepayment of the Term Loan Facility pursuant to   Section 4.4(b)   or (ii) under   Section 4.4(b)(iii)   and proceeds remain after the prepayment of the Term Loan Facility pursuant to   Section 4.4(b)  , the Borrower shall promptly deliver a Notice of Prepayment to the Administrative Agent and upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders.

  Section 3.5        Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower  .  In the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees, and, in the case of the Existing Letters of Credit, the Borrower agrees to cause Fossil Partners, to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Loan as provided for in this Section or with funds from other sources), in same day funds, the Issuing Lender on each date on which the Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft paid under any Letter of Credit for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in   Section 3.3(c)   incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment.  Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender that the Borrower intends to reimburse the Issuing Lender for such drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting that the Revolving Credit Lenders make a Revolving Credit Loan as a Base Rate Loan on such date in the amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any amounts referred to in   Section 3.3(c)   incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, and the Revolving Credit Lenders shall make a Revolving Credit Loan as a Base Rate Loan in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount of the related drawing and costs and expenses.  Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with this Section to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in   Section 2.3(a)   or   Article VI  .  If the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Loans which were then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full. 
  Section 3.6        Obligations Absolute  .  The Borrower s obligations under this   Article III   (including, without limitation, the Reimbursement Obligations) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  The Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower s Reimbursement Obligations under   Section 3.5   shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Lender s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to the Borrower.  The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 

Section 3.7        Effect of Letter of Credit Application  .  To the extent that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this   Article III  , the provisions of this   Article III   shall apply. 
  Section 3.8        Guaranty by the Borrower of Reimbursement Obligations under Existing Letters of Credit  .  The Borrower hereby guarantees the payment, promptly when due, of all Reimbursement Obligations of Fossil Partners with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit.

Loan or any portion thereof as to which the Borrower has not duly specified an interest rate as provided herein shall be deemed a Base Rate Loan. 
  (b)        Interest Periods  .  In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower, by giving notice at the times described in   Section 2.3   or   5.2  , as applicable, shall elect an interest period (each, an    Interest Period   ) to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period shall be a period of one (1) week, one (1) month, two (2) months, three (3) months or six (6) months;   provided   that: 
  (i)        the Interest Period shall commence on the date of advance of or conversion to any LIBOR Rate Loan and, in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods, each successive Interest Period shall commence on the date on which the immediately preceding Interest Period expires; 
  (ii)        if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day;   provided   that, if any Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Rate Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day;

  (iv)        no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable; and 
  (v)        there shall be no more than ten (10) outstanding Interest Periods in effect at any time. 
  (c)        Default Rate  .

  (d)        Interest Payment and Computation  .  Interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing March 31, 2015; and interest on each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and if such Interest Period extends over three (3) months, at the end of each three (3) month interval during such Interest Period.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest provided hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year).

In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem  

applicable hereto.  In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall at the Administrative Agent s option (i) promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or (ii) apply such excess to the principal balance of the Obligations on a pro rata basis.

  Section 5.2        Notice and Manner of Conversion or Continuation of Loans  .    Provided   that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Borrower shall have the option to (a) convert at any time following the third Business Day after the Closing Date all or any portion of any outstanding Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof into one or more LIBOR Rate Loans and (b) upon the expiration of any Interest Period, (i) convert all or any part of its outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans in a principal amount equal to $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof into Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or (ii) continue such LIBOR Rate Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans.  Whenever the Borrower desires to convert or continue Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable prior written notice in the form attached as Exhibit E (a    Notice of Conversion/Continuation   ) not later than 12:00 noon three (3) Business Days before the day on which a proposed conversion or continuation of such Loan is to be effective specifying (A) the Loans to be converted or continued, and, in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan to be converted or continued, the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (B) the effective date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of such Loans to be converted or continued, and (D) the Interest Period to be applicable to such converted or continued LIBOR Rate Loan.  If the Borrower fails to give a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation prior to the end of the Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loan, then the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan.  Any such automatic conversion to a Base Rate Loan shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan.  If the Borrower requests a conversion to, or continuation of, LIBOR Rate Loans, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swingline Loan may not be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the affected Lenders of such Notice of Conversion/Continuation. 
  Section 5.3        Fees  .

Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of each such payment, the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each such Lender at its address for notices set forth herein its Commitment Percentage in respect of the relevant Credit Facility (or other share as provided herein) of such payment and shall wire advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent on account of the principal of or interest on the Swingline Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts payable to the Swingline Lender shall be made in like manner, but for the account of the Swingline Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of the Issuing Lender s fees or L/C Participants  commissions shall be made in like manner, but for the account of the Issuing Lender or the L/C Participants, as the case may be.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of the Administrative Agent s fees or expenses shall be made for the account of the Administrative Agent, and any amount payable to any Lender under   Section 5.9  ,   5.10  ,   5.11   or   14.3   shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lender.  Subject to   Section 5.1(b)(ii)  , if any payment under this Agreement shall be specified to be made upon a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing any interest if payable along with such payment.

  (c)        Authorization regarding Certain Payments  .  To facilitate the payment of certain amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrower (i) shall maintain at least one of its principal deposit accounts with Wells Fargo (or any successor Administrative Agent) and (ii) authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge such deposit account and/or any other deposit account maintained by the Borrower with Wells Fargo (or any successor Administrative Agent), up to the amount available therein, in order to pay any principal (including unreimbursed amounts drawn under Letters of Credit), interest or fees then due by the Borrower under this Agreement, any Note or the Fee Letter (but excluding costs and expenses or indemnification obligations payable under   Section 14.3  ).  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (A) the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to effectuate any such charge referred to in this   Section 5.4(c)  , (B) if and to the extent that the Administrative Agent does effectuate any such charge, the same may cause an overdraft which may result in the depository bank s refusal to honor other items drawn on such account until adequate deposits are made to such account, and (C) if and to the extent that such a charge is not made, the Borrower is nonetheless obligated to pay all such amounts when due in accordance with this Agreement, the Notes and/or the Fee Letter (as applicable). 
  Section 5.5        Evidence of Indebtedness  . 
  (a)        Extensions of Credit  .  The Extensions of Credit made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Extensions of Credit made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Revolving Credit Note and/or a Swingline Note, as applicable,  

which shall evidence such Lender s Revolving Credit Loans and/or Swingline Loans, as applicable, in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the date, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
  (b)        Participations  .  In addition to the accounts and records referred to in   Section 5.5(a)  , each Revolving Credit Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolving Credit Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Credit Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
  Section 5.6        Adjustments  .  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations (other than pursuant to   Section 5.9  ,   5.10  ,   5.11   or   14.3  ) greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;   provided   that: 
  (i)        if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and 
  (ii)        the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in   Section 5.14   or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
  Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Credit Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Credit Party in the amount of such participation. 
  Section 5.7        Obligations of Lenders  . 
  (a)        Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of any proposed borrowing and (ii) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   Sections 2.3(b)   and   4.2   and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the daily average Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the  

Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
  (b)        Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent  .  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case maybe, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
  (c)        Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit  .  The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit are several and are not joint or joint and several.  The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Loan requested by the Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date. 
  Section 5.8        Changed Circumstances  . 
  (a)        Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability  .  In connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or any Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower.  Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower shall either (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan together with accrued interest thereon (subject to   Section 5.1(d)  ), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period; or (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, the Borrower shall convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Loan to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period. 
  (b)        Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability  .  If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force  

of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan or any Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders.  Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR hereunder, (ii) all Base Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to LIBOR and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR for the remainder of such Interest Period. 
  Section 5.9        Indemnity  .  The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense (including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained) which may arise or be attributable to each Lender s obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor.  The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender s reasonable discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical.  A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the factual basis for, and calculations used in, determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. 
  Section 5.10        Increased Costs  . 
  (a)        Increased Costs Generally  .  If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Lender; 
  (ii)        subject any Recipient to any Taxes of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by   Section 5.11   and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender); or 
  (iii)        impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of  

any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        Capital Requirements  .  If any Lender or the Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender or such Issuing Lender the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered.   
  (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement  .  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the factual basis for, and calculations used in, determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in   Section 5.10(a)   or   5.10(b)   and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)        Delay in Requests  .  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Issuing Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  Section 5.11        Taxes  . 
  (a)        Defined Terms  .  For purposes of this   Section 5.11  , the term  Lender  includes the Issuing Lender and the term  Applicable Law  includes FATCA. 
  (b)        Payments Free of Taxes  .  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes; except as required by Applicable Law.  If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  (c)        Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower  .  The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 

(d)        Indemnification by the Borrower  .  The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender for any amount in respect of any such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses if written demand therefor was not made by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender within 180 days from the date on which such party makes payment for such penalties, interest or expenses;   provided     further   that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses arising out of the retroactive application of any such Indemnified Tax.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (e)        Indemnification by the Lenders  .  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties     to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 14.9(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this   paragraph (e)  . 
  (f)        Evidence of Payments  .  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this   Section 5.11  , such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  (g)        Status of Lenders  .   
  (i)        Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in   Sections 5.11(g)(ii)(A)  ,   5.11(g)(ii)(B)   and   5.11(g)(ii)(D)   below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  (ii)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
  (A)        Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from  

time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax; 
  (B)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (1)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (2)        executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
  (3)        in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit K-1   to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a  bank  within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a  controlled foreign corporation  described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a    U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate   ) and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E; or 
  (4)        to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit K-2   or   Exhibit K-3  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit K-4   on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
  (C)        any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding Tax duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)        if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the  

Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this   clause (D)  ,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (h)        Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this   Section 5.11   (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 5.11  ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this   paragraph (h)   (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this   paragraph (h)  , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this   paragraph (h)   the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
  (i)        Survival  .  Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
  Section 5.12        Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  . 
  (a)        Designation of a Different Lending Office  .  If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 5.10  , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 5.11  , then such Lender shall, at the request of the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 5.10   or   Section 5.11  , as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  (b)        Replacement of Lenders  .  If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 5.10  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 5.11  , and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with   Section 5.12(a)   within ten (10) Business Days following such request for compensation or request for payment, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender hereunder or becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 14.9  ), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to   Section 5.10   or   Section 5.11  ) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that: 

(i)        the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 14.9  ; 
  (ii)        such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under   Section 5.9  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (iii)        in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 5.10   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 5.11  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
  (iv)        such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law; 
  (v)        in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  Section 5.13        Incremental Loans  .   
  (a)        At any time, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more (x) incremental term loan commitments (any such incremental term loan commitment, an    Incremental Term Loan Commitment   ) to make one or more additional term loans (any such additional term loans, an    Incremental Term Loan   ) and/or (y) increases in the Revolving Credit Commitments (any such increase, an    Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment    and, together with the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, the    Incremental Loan Commitments   ) to make revolving credit loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (any such increase, an    Incremental Revolving Credit Increase    and, together with the Incremental Term Loans, the    Incremental Loans      provided   that (i) the total aggregate principal amount for all such Incremental Loan Commitments shall not (as of any date of incurrence thereof) exceed an amount of additional Indebtedness which would cause the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as of the Fiscal Quarter most recently ended prior to the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional Indebtedness, to exceed 2.00 to 1.00; and (ii) the total aggregate amount for each Incremental Loan Commitment (and the Incremental Loans  made thereunder) shall not be less than a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or, if less, the remaining amount permitted pursuant to the foregoing clause (i).  Each such notice shall specify the date (each, an    Increased Amount Date   ) on which the Borrower proposes that any Incremental Loan Commitment shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to Administrative Agent. 
  (b)        The Borrower may invite any Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender and/or any Approved Fund, and/or any other Person reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to provide an Incremental Loan Commitment (any such Person, an    Incremental Lender    provided, however, that no such Person may be an Incremental Lender unless such Person meets all of the requirements of an assignee of the rights and obligations of a Lender under   Section 14.9   of this Agreement.  Any proposed Incremental Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of any Incremental Loan Commitment may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Loan Commitment.   
  (c)        Any Incremental Loan Commitment shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date;   provided   that:

No delay or failure to take action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default.  No course of dealing between the  Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or their respective agents or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or to constitute a waiver of any Event of Default. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Credit Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with   Section 12.2   for the benefit of all the Lenders and the Issuing Lender;   provided   that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with   Section 14.4   (subject to the terms of   Section 5.6  ), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Credit Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and   provided  ,   further  , that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to   Section 12.2   and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in   clauses (b)  ,   (c)   and   (d)   of the preceding proviso and subject to   Section 5.6  , any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders. 
  Section 12.4        Crediting of Payments and Proceeds  .  In the event that the Obligations have been accelerated pursuant to   Section 12.2   or the Administrative Agent or any Lender has exercised any right or remedy set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, all payments received by the Lenders upon the Obligations and all net proceeds from the enforcement of the Obligations shall be applied: 
  First  , to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts, including attorney fees, payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such, the Issuing Lender in its capacity as such and the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such (ratably among the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause First payable to them);

  Last  , the balance, if any, after the Revolving Credit Commitment has terminated and all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Applicable Law.

Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of   Article XIII   for itself and its Affiliates as if a  Lender  party hereto.

  (b)        to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under   Section 3.3  ,   Section 5.3   and   Section 14.3  . 
  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding. 

Section 12.6        Credit Bidding  .

  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
  Section 13.1        Appointment and Authority  .  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Wells Fargo to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term  agent  herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law.  Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
  The Administrative Agent shall also act as the  collateral agent  under the Loan Documents, as applicable, and each of the Secured Parties hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Secured Party for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Credit Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including, without limitation, to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Secured Parties).  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as  collateral agent  and any co agents, sub agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this   Article XIII   for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of   Article XIII   and   XIV   (including   Section 14.3  , as though such co agents, sub agents and attorneys in fact were the  collateral agent  under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
  Section 13.2        Rights as a Lender  .  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that Wells Fargo may have a participation or other interest in the Commercial Letter of Credit Facility. 

Section 13.3        Exculpatory Provisions  .   
  (a)        The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder and thereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
  (i)        shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
  (ii)        shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents),   provided   that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and 
  (iii)        shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
  (b)        The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in   Section 14.2   and   Section 12.2  ) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Lender. 
  (c)        The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in   Article VI   or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
  Section 13.4        Reliance by the Administrative Agent  .  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 

Section 13.5        Delegation of Duties  .  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights, remedies and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights, remedies and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Credit Facility as well as activities as Administrative Agent. 
  Section 13.6        Resignation of Administrative Agent  . 
  (a)        The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Resignation Effective Date   ), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  (b)        If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to   clause (d)   of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Removal Effective Date   ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
  (c)        With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and   Section 14.3   shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
  (d)        Any resignation by, or removal of, Wells Fargo as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender.  Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender, (ii) the retiring Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the  

other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor Issuing Lender shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
  Section 13.7        Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders  .  Each Lender and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
  Section 13.8        No Other Duties, etc.    Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the syndication agents, documentation agents, co agents, bookrunner, lead manager, arranger, lead arranger or co arranger listed on the cover page or signature pages hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder.  
  Section 13.9        Collateral and Guaranty Matters  .  Each of the Lenders (including its or any of its Affiliate s capacities as a Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any counterparty to any Specified Hedge Agreement or Specified Cash Management Arrangement that was a Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender at the time such agreement was executed): 
  (a)        to release any Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties (whether or not on the date of such release there may be outstanding Specified Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations not then due), under any Loan Document (i) upon repayment of all outstanding principal of and all accrued interest on the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, payment of all outstanding fees and expenses hereunder, the termination of all Commitments and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, or (iii) subject to   Section 14.2  , if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders; 
  (b)        to subordinate or release any Lien on any non-material portion of the Collateral (whether or not on the date of such subordination or release there may be outstanding Specified Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations not then due) granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Permitted Lien; and 
  (c)        to release any Subsidiary Guarantor (whether or not on the date of such release there may be outstanding Specified Obligations or contingent indemnification obligations not then due) from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement and any other Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. 
  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement pursuant to this Section. 
  Section 13.10        Release of Liens and Guarantees of Subsidiaries  .  If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Borrower or any other Credit Party in a transaction permitted by this Agreement (including by way of merger, consolidation or in connection with the sale of a Subsidiary permitted hereunder), then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of the Borrower or such other Credit Party, shall execute and deliver without recourse, representation or warranty all releases or other documents necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created by any of the Security Documents on such Collateral.  In the case of any  

such sale, transfer or disposal of any property constituting Collateral in a transaction constituting an Asset Disposition permitted pursuant to   Section 11.5  , the Liens created by any of the Security Documents on such property shall be automatically released (without need for further action by any person).  At the request and sole expense of the Borrower, a Subsidiary that is a Credit Party shall be released from all its obligations under this Agreement and under all other Loan Documents in the event that all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by this Agreement (including by way of merger or consolidation) and if no Event of Default exists or would result therefrom, and the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of the Borrower, shall execute and deliver without recourse, representation or warranty all releases or other documents necessary or desirable to evidence or confirm the foregoing. 
  Section 13.11        Specified Cash Management Arrangements and Specified Hedge Agreements  .  No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of   Section 12.4   or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Security Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this   Article XIII   to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Specified Hedge Agreements and Specified Cash Management Arrangement unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Specified Hedge Agreements and Specified Cash Management Arrangement, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, unless expressly set forth therein, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (including Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York), without reference to the conflicts or choice of law principles thereof that would require application of another law (but giving effect to federal laws relating to national banks). 
  (b)        Submission to Jurisdiction  .  Each of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of New York sitting in New York, New York and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action, litigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court.

  (c)        Waiver of Venue  .  The Borrower and each other Credit Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, litigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to   Section 14.5(b)  .  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, litigation or proceeding in any such court. 
  (d)        Service of Process  .  Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in   Section 14.1  .  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

  (C)        the consents of the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  (iv)        Assignment and Assumption  .

  (vii)        Certain Additional Payments  .  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested, but not funded by, the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities which constitute a part of the Obligations then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this   clause (vii)  , then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to   Section 14.9(c)  , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Section 5.9  ,   Section 5.10  ,   Section 5.11   and   Section 14.3   with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with   paragraph (d)   of this section (other than a purported assignment to a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, which shall be null and void). 
  (c)        Register  .  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of (and stated interest on) the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (but only to the extent of entries in the Register that are applicable to such Lender), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  (d)        Participations  .  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,  

the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under   Section 14.3(c)   with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). 
  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver or modification described in   Section 14.2   that directly affects such Participant and could not be affected by a vote of the Required Lenders.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 5.9  ,   Section 5.10   and   Section 5.11   (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under   Section 5.11(g)   (it being understood that the documentation required under   Section 5.11(g)   shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   Section 14.9(b)  ;   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of   Section 5.12   as if it were an assignee under   Section 14.9(b)  ; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 5.10   or   Section 5.11  , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of   Section 5.12(b)   with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 14.4   as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 5.6   as though it were a Lender. 
  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)        Certain Pledges  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

  (a)        All representations and warranties set forth in   Article VII   and all representations and warranties contained in any certificate or any of the Loan Documents (including, but not limited to, any such representation or warranty made in or in connection with any amendment thereto) shall constitute representations and warranties made under this Agreement.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)        Certain Fees  . 

(A)        No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
  (B)        Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit commissions pursuant to   Section 3.3   for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to   Section 5.14  . 
  (C)        With respect to any Commitment Fee or letter of credit commission not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2) pay to each Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender s or Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
  (iv)        Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .

Subject to   Section 14.23  , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)        Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans  .

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by Applicable Law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker s board or office of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk.  The Administrative Agent may disclaim all warranties in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, including, without limitation, all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like.  The Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.  Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor s premises or elsewhere.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages, or demands result solely from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, in each case against whom such claim is asserted.  If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by Applicable Law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least ten (10) Business Days before such sale or other disposition. 
  Section 5.2    Specific Remedies  . 
  (a)        Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default: 
  (i)        the Administrative Agent may communicate with Account Debtors of any Account subject to a Security Interest and upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Grantor shall notify (such notice to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) its Account Debtors subject to a Security Interest that such Accounts have been assigned to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties; 
  (ii)        upon the request of the Administrative Agent, whenever any Grantor shall receive any cash, money, checks or any other similar items of payment relating to any Collateral (including any Proceeds of any Collateral), subject to the terms of any Permitted Liens, such Grantor agrees that it will, within one (1) Business Day of such receipt, deposit all such items of payment into a cash collateral account at the Administrative Agent (the    Collateral Account   ) or in a Deposit Account (other than an Excluded Deposit Account) at a Controlled Depositary, and until such Grantor shall deposit such cash, money, checks or any other similar items of payment in the Collateral Account or in a Deposit Account (other than an Excluded Deposit Account) at a Controlled Depositary, such Grantor shall hold such cash, money, checks or any other similar items of payment in trust for the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and as property of the Secured Parties, separate from the other funds of such Grantor, and the Administrative Agent shall have the right in to transfer or direct the transfer of the balance of each Deposit Account (other than an Excluded Deposit Account) to the Collateral Account.  All such Collateral and Proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent  

hereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent in the Collateral Account as collateral security for all of the Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in   Section 5.3  ; 
  (iii)        the Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or distributions made in respect of any Collateral constituting Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests or other Proceeds paid in respect of any such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests, and any or all of any such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests may, at the option of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter exercise (A) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such Investment Property or any such Partnership/LLC Interests at any meeting of shareholders, partners or members of the relevant Issuers or otherwise and (B) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate, partnership or limited liability company structure of any Issuer or upon the exercise by any Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of such Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability except to account for property actually received by it, but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or option and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.  In furtherance thereof, each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer with respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property and Partnership/LLC Interests to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully protected in so complying following receipt of such notice and prior to notice that such Event of Default is no longer continuing, and (ii) except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends, distributions or other payments with respect to any Investment Property or Partnership/LLC Interests directly to the Administrative Agent; and 
  (iv)        the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to (but shall not be required to):  (A) proceed to perform any and all obligations of the applicable Grantor under any Material Contract constituting Collateral and exercise all rights of such Grantor thereunder as fully as such Grantor itself could, (B) do all other acts which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or proper to protect its Security Interest granted hereunder, provided such acts are not inconsistent with or in violation of the terms of any of the Credit Agreement, of the other Loan Documents or Applicable Law, and (C) sell, assign or otherwise transfer any Material Contract constituting Collateral in accordance with the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and Applicable Law, subject, however, to the prior approval of each other party to such Material Contract to the extent required under the Material Contract. 
  (b)        Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given written notice to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent s intent to exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to   Section 5.2(a)  , each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends, payments or other distributions made in respect of any Investment Property and any Partnership/LLC Interests, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and other corporate, company and partnership rights with respect to any Investment Property and Partnership/LLC Interests. 
  Section 5.3    Application of Proceeds  .  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of the Collateral or any Proceeds of the Collateral in payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in accordance with   Section 12.4   of the Credit Agreement.  Only after (a) the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of Applicable Law, including, without limitation, Section 9-610 and Section 9-615 of the UCC, (b) the payment in full of the Obligations (other than (1)  

contingent indemnification obligations not then due and (2) the Specified Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall have been made) and (c) the termination of the Commitments, shall the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same (if such Person is not a Grantor). 
  Section 5.4    Waiver, Deficiency  .  Each Grantor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any Applicable Law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof.  Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements to collect such deficiency.

in respect of any Collateral; (E) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (F) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (G) to the extent constituting Collateral, license or assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (H) generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent was the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent s option and such Grantor s expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things that the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Administrative Agent s and the other Secured Parties  Security Interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do. 
  (b)        If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement in accordance with the provisions of   Section 6.1(a)  .

  (d)        Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof in accordance with   Section 6.1(a)  .  All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the Security Interests created hereby are released. 
  Section 6.2    Duty of Administrative Agent  .  The sole duty of Administrative Agent with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative Agent deals with similar property for its own account.  None of the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party or any of their respective Related Parties shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof.  The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party or any of their respective Related Parties to exercise any such powers.  The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their respective Related Parties shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
  Section 6.3    Authority of Administrative Agent  .  Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting from or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

  Section 7.5    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process  . 
  (a)        Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (including Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York), without reference to the conflicts or choice of law principles thereof that would require application of another law (but giving effect to federal laws relating to national banks). 
  (b)        Submission to Jurisdiction  .  Each Grantor irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether relating to this Agreement or the transactions relating hereto in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York state     court or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.  Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action, litigation or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Grantor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
  (c)        Waiver of Venue  .  Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, litigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
  (d)        Service of Process  .  Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in   Section 14.1     of the Credit Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. 
  (e)        Appointment of the Borrower as Agent for the Grantors  .  Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Borrower to act as its agent for service of process and notices required to be delivered under this Agreement or under the other Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that receipt by the Borrower of any summons, notice or other similar item shall be deemed effective receipt by each Grantor and its Subsidiaries. 
  Section 7.6    Waiver of Jury Trial  .  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS   SECTION 7.6  . 
  Section 7.7    Injunctive Relief  .  Each Grantor recognizes that, in the event such Grantor fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties.  Therefore, each Grantor  

agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, at the option of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
  Section 7.8    No Waiver By Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies  .  The enumeration of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties set forth in this Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies, all of which shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or that may now or hereafter exist at law or in equity or by suit or otherwise.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to   Section 7.2  ), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default.  No delay or failure to take action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.  A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.  No course of dealing between any Grantor, the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party or their respective agents or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.   
  Section 7.9    Successors and Assigns  .  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; except that no Grantor may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders (except as otherwise provided by the Credit Agreement). 
  Section 7.10    Survival of Indemnities  .  Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties are entitled under the provisions of   Section 7.3   and any other provision of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against events arising after such termination as well as before. 
  Section 7.11    Severability of Provisions  .  Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions hereof or thereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
  Section 7.12    Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith by facsimile or in electronic (  i.e.    pdf  or  tif ) form shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other document or instrument, as applicable. 
  Section 7.13    Integration  .  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Credit Agreement, the provisions of the Credit Agreement shall control, and in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any other Security Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control;   provided   that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. 
  Section 7.14    Acknowledgements  . 

(a)        Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that (i) it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement and has reviewed and understands the same and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor. 
  (b)        Each Issuer party to this Agreement acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Agreement and agrees to be bound thereby and to comply with the terms thereof insofar as such terms are applicable to it.

  (b)        Subject to   Section 13.9     of the Credit Agreement, if any of the Collateral shall be sold or otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases or other documents reasonably necessary or desirable to evidence the release of the Liens created hereby on such Collateral.  In the event that all the Capital Stock of any Grantor that is a Subsidiary of the Borrower shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then, at the request of the Borrower and at the expense of the Grantors, such Grantor shall be released from its obligations hereunder and, at the reasonable request of the Borrower and at the expense of the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall, within a commercially reasonable period of time, execute and deliver to the Borrower any releases or other documents reasonably necessary or desirable to evidence such release. 
  Section 7.16    Additional Grantors  .

All powers of attorney and other authorizations granted to the Secured Parties, the Administrative Agent and any Persons designated by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the Obligations (other than (1) contingent indemnification obligations not then due, (2) the Specified Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall have been made and (3) Letters of Credit that have been Cash Collateralized or other arrangements with respect thereto have been made that are satisfactory to the Issuing Lender) remain unpaid or unsatisfied, any of the Commitments remain in effect or the Credit Facility has not been terminated.
