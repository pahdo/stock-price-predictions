PART I         Item 1. Business         DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS          Company Business      Golden Matrix Group, Inc.

      Table of Contents             Item 6. Selected Financial Data       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.       Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        Forward-looking statements      This report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as  anticipate ,  expects ,  intends ,  plans ,  believes ,  seeks  and  estimates  and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Form 10-K. Investors should carefully consider all of such risks before making an investment decision with respect to the Company s stock. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for Golden Matrix Group, Inc. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management.     At July 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $2,296. In order to meet our budgeted cash requirements over the next 12 months, we anticipate raising money from equity financing from the sale of our common stock and loans from shareholders and third parties. If we are not successful in raising additional financing, we anticipate that we will not be able to proceed with our business plan. In such a case, we may decide to discontinue our current business plan and seek other business opportunities. Any business opportunity would require our management to perform due diligence on possible acquisitions. Such due diligence would likely include purchase investigation costs such as professional fees by consultants. It is anticipated that additional funds will be required to close any possible acquisition. During this period, we will need to maintain our periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal and accounting costs. Although we are actively exploring such opportunities, there can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will be successful. If no other such opportunities are available and we cannot raise additional capital to sustain minimum operations, we may be forced to discontinue business. We do not have any specific alternative business opportunities in mind and have not planned for any such contingency.     Based on the nature of our business, we anticipate incurring operating losses in the foreseeable future. We base this expectation, in part, on the fact that we need to complete development of our online gaming sites and invest in the acquisition of players. Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include the following:                   our ability to raise additional funding;                        competition in the online gaming technology area; and                        the regulatory climate for online gaming.                       8       
      Table of Contents          Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate substantial recurring revenues, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     The following Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Form 10-K.       COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2016 TO THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2015       Results of Operations         Revenues       We generated $ 20,000 revenues during the year ended July 31, 2016 as compared to $ 0 for the year ended July 31, 2015. The increase of the revenue was mainly due to the change of business content related to the management of a casino s back-office and providing online gaming software system during 2016.       General and administrative Expenses       During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $541,645 and $2,039,931, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of the termination agreement on consulting and legal services. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of office expenses, consulting fees, management fees, legal fees and accounting and audit fees.        Amortization and impairment       During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, amortization and impairment expense was $4,674,712 and $0, respectively. The increase was due to the impairment of the intellectual property  We Buy Gold  acquired on November 6, 2015 and December 7, 2015, and the Gaming IP and know-how acquired on February 22, 2016.       Interest Expense       During the years ended July31, 2016 and 2015, interest expense was $4,551,795 and $$803,149, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the decrease of interest expense occurred on the insurance of convertible debt during year 2015.       Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative liability - note conversion feature       Unrealized loss on derivative liability - note conversion feature was $2,959,471 for the year ended July 31, 2016 as compared to unrealized loss of $221,809 for the year ended July 31, 2015. The change primarily resulted from the fluctuation of the Company s stock price which impacted the value of the derivative liability.                  9       
      Table of Contents            Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt       Gain on extinguishment of debt was $2,701,378 for the year ended July 31, 2016 as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2015. The change primarily resulted from the Cancellation and Release agreement signed on May 25, 2016.       Net Loss       We incurred net losses of $10,006,245 and $2,621,271 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net loss was a result of the items discussed above.     There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we have not generated enough revenues to cover our expenses and continue to suffer recurring losses.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      Our cash used in operating activities for the year ended July 31, 2016 was $1,296 as compared to $2,010,636 for the year ended July 31, 2015. The decrease in cash used in operations was primarily attributable to the collections of receivable from our customers in 2015.     Our cash provided by financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2016 was $1,000 as compared to $2,010,000, for the year ended July 31, 2015. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable and common stock issued for cash.     The Company had $2,296 in cash at July 31, 2016. We believe the Company will be able to raise adequate resources to implement its strategic objectives in upcoming quarters, although we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such additional financing, on acceptable terms, or at all, which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures, including reductions of personnel and capital expenditures. Failure to raise new capital or to operate a viable business with reduced operating costs and other expenditures may cause the business to fail, which, in turn, will result in the loss of the investments of our investors.  There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then our venture will fail.      Off-balance sheet arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.       Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.       Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM       To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Golden Matrix Group, Inc.:      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Golden Matrix Group, Inc. ( the Company ) as of July 31, 2016 and the related statement of operations, stockholders  equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.      We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Golden Matrix Group, Inc., as of July 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.     The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     /s/ B F Borgers CPA PC      B F Borgers CPA PC  Lakewood, CO  November 14, 2016              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM      To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   Source Gold Corp.     We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Source Gold Corp. as of July 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Source Gold Corp. at July 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Source Gold Corp. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company had an accumulated deficit at July 31, 2015, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year then ended. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     /s/ Scrudato   Co., PA  Califon, New Jersey     October 30, 2015                      See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION       Golden Matrix Group, Inc. ( GMGI  or the  Company ), a Nevada corporation, formed on June 4, 2008, under the name Ibex Resources Corp., has a global presence with offices in Las Vegas Nevada and Sydney Australia. GMGI s sophisticated social gaming software supports multiple languages including English and Chinese.     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of GMGI include the accounts of GMGI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, companies IRC Exploration Ltd., ( IRC ) a company incorporated in Alberta, Canada on August 1, 2008; Northern Bonanza Inc., ( NBI ) a company incorporated in Ontario, Canada on June 30, 2010; Source Bonanza LLC, ( SB ) a Limited Liability Company incorporated in Nevada, USA on June 18, 2010; and Vulture Gold LLC ( Vulture ), a Nevada Limited Liability Company which was acquired on August 7, 2010, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. All intercompany balances have been eliminated.       NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN       The accompanying consolidated financial statements of GMGI have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and had a net working capital deficit of $3,981,442 at July 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for GMGI to continue as a going concern. GMGI s management plans on raising cash from public or private debt or equity financing, on an as needed basis, and in the longer term, revenues from the gambling business. GMGI s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on these additional cash financings, and ultimately upon achieving profitable operations through the development of its gambling business.      NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Reclassification      Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.      Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.             Allowance for doubtful accounts      The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no allowances for doubtful accounts.      Long Lived Assets      Long-lived assets to be held and used or disposed of other than by sale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used or disposed of other than by sale are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.      Intangible Assets      Intangible assets consist of expenditures for domain names and certain intellectual properties acquired for an online horse racing product the Company is developing. The intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized over its estimated useful life of 3 years.      Derivative Instruments       Derivatives are measured at their fair value on the balance sheet. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations.       Debt Discount      Debt discount is amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method.      Revenues      Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.             Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:                    Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;                        Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and                        Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.          Our financial instruments include cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, notes payable, convertible notes payable, advances from shareholder, and derivative liabilities. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. The derivative liabilities are stated at their fair value as a level 3 measurement. The Company used a Black-Scholes model to determine the fair values of these derivative liabilities.       Stock-Based Compensation      Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for stock and stock options awarded in return for services rendered. The expense is measured at the grant-date fair value of the award and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, which is typically the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures that it expects will occur and records expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest.      Income Taxes      Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, and (b) net operating loss carry forwards. No net provision for refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statement of operations because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carry forward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized.       Loss Per Common Share       Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of any outstanding stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period represented or the date of issuance, whatever is late, and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net income (loss) position at the calculation date.     There are no common stock equivalents outstanding and, thus, diluted and basic loss per share is the same.             Subsequent Events      GMGI evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued for disclosure purposes.      Recently Issued Accounting Standards       In May 2014, a pronouncement was issued that creates common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance supersedes most preexisting revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with an option to adopt the standard one year earlier. The new standard is to be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.     In February 2016, a pronouncement was issued that creates new accounting and reporting guidelines for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.      The Company does not believe that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.      NOTE 4   INTANGIBLE ASSETS       On November 6, 2015 and December 7, 2015, the Company purchased 100% interest in the intellectual property  We Buy Gold.  The Company expects the intellectual property to bring value to the Company for the first three years of its service and as such the property is classified as a definitive asset and is amortized over a 3-year period. During the year ended July 31, 2016, management evaluated the carrying value on the intellectual property  We Buy Gold.  and recorded an impairment of $1,800,000 due to uncertain recoverability.     On February 22, 2016 the Company entered into a Know-How and Asset Purchase Agreement with Luxor Capital, LLC, whereby the Company acquired Gaming IP and know-how. The purchase price for these assets consisted of a convertible note in the amount of $2,874,712, included $2,374,712 payable to Luxor Capital, LLC and 1,666,667 shares of the Company s common stock. During the year ended July 31, 2016, management evaluated the carrying value on the intellectual property and recorded an impairment of $2,874,712 due to uncertain recoverability.

The promissory note is unsecured, interest free and repayable upon demand.     The note may be converted at the option of the holder into Common stock of the Company. The fixed conversion price is $0.01 per share. Accordingly the note may be converted into 2,000 common shares of the Company.     The Company determined that this Promissory note should be accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 470-20 which addresses  Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features". The beneficial conversion feature is calculated at its intrinsic value (that is, the difference between the conversion price $0.01 and the fair value of the common stock into which the debt is convertible at the commitment date (per share being $0.08), multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt is convertible. The valuation of the beneficial conversion feature recorded cannot be greater than the face value of the note issued.      Promissory Note #5      On October 30, 2012, the Company received funding pursuant to a convertible promissory note in the amount of $12,000. The promissory note is unsecured; bears interest at 8% per annum, and matured on October 30, 2012. Any principal amount not paid by the maturity date bears interest at 22% per annum.

A portion of the proceeds from issuance of the convertible debt, equal to the intrinsic value, is allocated to additional paid-in capital. Because the debt is due on demand and is convertible at the date of issuance, the valuation of the beneficial conversion feature is charged to interest expense at the date of issuance.

The fair value of the conversion future of the notes was recognized as a derivative liability instrument and will be measured at fair value at each reporting period.             During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded derivative liabilities for embedded conversion features related to convertible notes payable of face value $3,085,745 and $279,167 respectively. During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, $1,490,608 and $96,990 respectively of convertible notes payable and accrued interest was converted into common stock of the Company. For the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company performed a final mark-to-market adjustment for the derivative liability related to the convertible notes of and the carrying amount of the derivative liability related to the conversion feature of $5,570,955 and $214,648 respectively, was re-classed to additional paid in capital on the date of conversion in the statement of shareholders  deficit. During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a loss of $4,102,907 and gain of $221,809 respectively, based on the change in fair value (mark-to market adjustment) of the derivative liability associated with the embedded conversion features in the accompanying statement of operations.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure       There have been no changes in or disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosure during the two fiscal years through to the date of this Report.          Item 9A. Controls and Procedures        Disclosure controls and procedures       The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the year ended July 31, 2016 covered by this Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.     Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting      The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company s internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:                  n     Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;                             n     Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and                             n     Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.         Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.            With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016 based upon the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of July 31, 2016. The Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses at July 31, 2016:              1.     Lack of oversight by independent directors in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;        2.     Lack of functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;        3.     Insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting and to allow for proper monitoring controls over accounting;        4.     Insufficient written policies and procedures over accounting transaction processing and period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.        To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures:                  n     The Company will add sufficient number of independent directors to the board and appoint an audit committee.                             n     The Company will add sufficient knowledgeable accounting personnel to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.                             n     Upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel, the Company will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures.        The additional hiring is contingent upon the Company s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity or debt for its continued operational activities and corporate expenses. Management expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.     We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls are a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when necessary.     This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Included in the Act is a provision that permanently exempts smaller public companies that qualify as either a Non-Accelerated Filer or Smaller Reporting Company from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls      The Company s management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.       Item 9B.
