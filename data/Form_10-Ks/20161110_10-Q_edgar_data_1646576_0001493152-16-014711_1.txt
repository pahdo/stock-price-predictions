NOTE
1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  

In
the opinion of management, the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 which has been derived from audited financial statements
and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary
to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 or for any future period.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management s
Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2016.

NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $1,200,300 and continuously incurred a net operating loss
of $265,488 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through June 30,
2017 is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes
the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they
become due.  

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies
as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.  

Basis
                                         of presentation    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ).  

Basis
                                         of consolidation

balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

Use
                                         of estimates    

In
preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

  FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ))  

  (Unaudited)  

Cash
                                         and cash equivalents    

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.  

Accounts
                                         receivable    

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical collection trends and aging of receivables. Management also periodically
evaluates individual customer s financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to make adjustments
in the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.  

Subscriptions
                                         receivable     

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $30,000 share subscriptions receivable from a shareholder. There
was no subscriptions receivable as of September 30, 2016.  

Revenue
                                         recognition     

In
accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605   Revenue Recognition  , the
Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue.
Revenue from trading of retail goods is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred and there are no continuing obligations
to the customer. Title and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to and accepted by the customer when the products are collected
by the customer at the Company s office. Revenue is recorded net of sales discounts, returns, allowances, and other adjustments
that are based upon management s best estimates and historical experience and are provided for in the same period as the
related revenues are recorded. Based on limited operating history, management estimates that there was no sales return for the
period reported.  

The
Company derives its revenue from sales of goods to individuals. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when products are sold
and accepted by the customers and there are no continuing obligations to the customer.  

Cost
                                         of revenues    

Cost
of revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to the customers.  

Income
                                         taxes    

The
provision of income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes  
( ASC Topic 740 ). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
Topic 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial
statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC Topic 740, tax positions must initially
be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the
tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has
a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the
position and relevant facts.  

The
Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial conditions or results
of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company conducts major businesses in Hong Kong and is subject
to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file tax returns that are subject to examination
by the foreign tax authority.  

Net
                                         loss per share    

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260   Earnings per share  . Basic loss per
share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional
common shares were dilutive.  

Foreign
                                         currencies translation    

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations.

  NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ))  

  (Unaudited)  

The
reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiary in Anguilla is United States Dollars ( US$ ). The Company s
subsidiary in Hong Kong maintains its books and record in Hong Kong Dollars ( HK$ ), which is functional currency
as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.  

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated
into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,   Translation of Financial Statement  , using the exchange rate
on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses
resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders  equity.  

Translation
of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective
periods:  

Related
                                         parties    

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly,
to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.  

Fair
                                         value of financial instruments    

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits
and other receivables, accounts payable, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the
short-term nature of these financial instruments.  

The
Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC
Topic 820-10 ), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820-10 establishes
a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
    1  : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;    

Level
    2  : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and    

Level
    3  : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
    own assumptions    

Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined
with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  

Recent
                                         accounting pronouncements    

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.  

NOTE
5 - SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 42,600 shares of its common stock at $1.5 per share
for aggregate gross proceeds of $63,900 for initial public offering.  

As

stock issued and outstanding. There are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.  

NOTE
6 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company issued convertible promissory notes (collectively the  Convertible Notes ) to investors
in an aggregated principal and accrued interest of $888,410 and $66,477, respectively. The Convertible Notes bear interest at
a rate of 8% per annum with a maturity of two years, due in 2017  2018. The principal and accrued interest are payable in
a lump sum at the maturity. The notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of
$0.25 per share at the note holders  sole and exclusive option.

Company
Overview  

Rito
Group Corp.(the  Company  or  Rito ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 24,
2015. Rito Group Corp is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International Limited, a Company
organized under the laws of the British Colony, Anguilla. It should be noted that the wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International
Ltd. owns 100% of Rito International Enterprise Company Limited, a Hong Kong Company.  

At
this time we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary and share the same business plan of our subsidiary which
is the sale of miscellaneous retail goods. To date the goods sold have been sold through the individual efforts of our management
by selling to personal contacts, and the sales have consisted of stainless steel and crystal accessories from Steela + Steelo
as well as cookware from Malox. Sino Union International Limited also shares the same business plan of Rito International Enterprise
Company Limited.  

The
future business of Rito is the development of  Rito Online mall  which will provide a platform for merchants and customers
to facilitate transactions and take advantage of the growth opportunity we have identified in Hong Kong s E-Commerce Industry.
The Rito Online Mall has not yet been developed and is not operational at this time.  

Results
of Operation   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated revenue in the amount of $14,315 while for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company generated revenues in the amount of $5,601. Our gross profits for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $782 while for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,110. The increase in revenue is due to a larger size
of sales order from a customer. The decrease in gross profit is due to increasing cost of sales. We believe that in order to attract
more customers in the future we must increase our marketing efforts and or develop new products.  

General
and administrative expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we have had general and administrative expenses in the amount of $247,468 while for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 we have had general and administrative expenses in the amount of $170,290. These expenses
are comprised of information technology development expenses of $125,627, marketing expenses of $55,772 and advertising and promotion
of $18,948.  

Net
loss   

Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $265,488 while our net loss for the three months ended September 30,
2015 was $170,991. The net loss mainly derived from the general and administrative expenses incurred.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Cash
Used In Operating Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities was $210,097 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $115,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The cash used in operating activities were a result of our
net loss attributable to information technology development expenses, marketing expenses and advertising and promotion.  

Cash
Used In Investing Activities    

Net
cash used in investing activities was $0 and $11,987 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The
cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was resulted from the purchase of plant and equipment.  

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities    

Net
cash provided by financing activities were $62,859 and $461,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
The cash provided by financing activities was contributed from the aggregate proceeds of $63,900 from the issuance of shares in
initial public offering for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and offset by the paid interest of $1,041 on convertible
notes.  

There
were no advances from directors for the three months ended September 30, 2016 while the total advances from directors and a related
company amounted to $25,719 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

In
regards to all of the above transactions we claim an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation
S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Regulation S ) for the above sales of the stock since the sales of the
stock were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions,
and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates,
or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.  

Going
Concern  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $1,200,300 and incurred a continuous net operating loss
of $265,488 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation
as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent
realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements  

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to our stockholders as of September 30, 2016.  

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4 Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:     

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

We
know of no materials, active or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceedings
or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any beneficial shareholder
are an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to us.
