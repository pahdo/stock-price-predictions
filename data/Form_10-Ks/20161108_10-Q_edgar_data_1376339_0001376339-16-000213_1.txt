MIMEDX GROUP, INC. 
  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015 
   
           1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) from interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Changes to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU  ) to the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ).  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented have been included.  Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year.  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015  , has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  
  You should read these condensed consolidated financial statements together with the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.  
  The Company operates in   one   business segment, Regenerative Biomaterials, which includes the design, manufacture, and marketing of products and tissue processing services for the Wound Care, Surgical, Sports Medicine, Ophthalmic and Dental market categories. The MiMedx allograft product families include our: dHACM family with AmnioFix , EpiFix  and EpiBurn  brands; Amniotic Fluid family with OrthoFlo brand; Umbilical family with EpiCord  and AmnioCord  brands; Placental Collagen family with CollaFix  and AmnioFill  brands; Bone family with Physio  brand; and Skin family with AlloBurn  brand. AmnioFix,  EpiFix, and EpiBurn are our tissue technologies processed from human amniotic membrane; OrthoFlo is an amniotic fluid derived allograft;  EpiCord  and AmnioCord  are derived from the umbilical cord; Physio is a bone grafting material comprised of 100% bone tissue with no added carrier; AlloBurn is a skin product derived from human skin designed for the treatment of burns; and CollaFix, our next brand we plan to commercialize, is our collagen fiber technology, developed with our patented cross-linking polymers, designed to mimic the natural composition, structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues in order to augment their repair.   
   
           2. 
    Significant Accounting Policies 
     Please see Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , for a description of all significant accounting policies.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized. Generally, the Company does not require collateral or any other security to support its receivables. 
  The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing receivables. The Company determines the allowance based on factors such as historical collection experience, customers' current creditworthiness, customer concentrations, age of accounts receivable balance and general economic conditions that may affect the customers' ability to pay.  
  Inventories 
  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value.  The Company assesses the valuation of its inventory on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for the Company's excess inventory charge. The Company's excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with operations to maximize recovery of excess inventory.  The value of inventory as of September 30, 2016 includes a fair value step - up connected with the January 2016 acquisition of Stability Inc. of approximately   $600,000  , which is comprised of approximately   $2.1 million   as of the date of the acquisition less amortization of approximately   $1.5 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Please see Note 4 contained herein. 
  
   8 

Revenue Recognition 
  The Company sells its products through a combination of a direct sales force and independent stocking distributors and representatives in the U.S. and independent distributors in international markets. The Company recognizes revenue when title to the goods transfers to customers, provided there are no material remaining performance obligations required of the Company or any matters of customer acceptance. In cases where the Company utilizes distributors or ships product directly to the end user, it recognizes revenue upon shipment provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.  A portion of the Company's revenue is generated from inventory maintained at hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices.  For these products, revenue is recognized at the time the product has been used or implanted.  The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and allowances as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.   
  Acquisitions 
  Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the Company s results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. 
    
  Contingent consideration is recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent payments are recognized in earnings. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of an earn out based on sales less direct production costs, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of these payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates and increases or decreases as revenue estimates or expectation of timing of payments changes. 
  Patent Costs 
  The Company incurs certain legal and related costs in connection with patent applications for tissue-based products and processes. The Company capitalizes such costs to be amortized over the expected life of the patent to the extent that an economic benefit is anticipated from the resulting patent or alternative future use is available to the Company and are included in Intangible Assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company capitalized approximately   $515,000   of patent costs during the first nine months of   2016  .  The Company capitalized approximately   $594,000   of patent costs during the first nine months of 2015. 
  Treasury Stock 
  The Company accounts for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method. Treasury stock which is reissued for the exercise of option grants and the issuance of restricted stock grants is accounted for on a first - in first - out (FIFO) basis. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") issued, both effective and 
  not yet effective. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with 
  Customers  (ASU 2014-09) that requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when 
  companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. This update is effective for annual reporting 
  periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein and requires expanded disclosures. The Company 
  is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes". ASU 2015-17 
  simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the 
  balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, 
  and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption 
  is permitted. The Company adopted this standard, prospectively, at the beginning of the fourth quarter 2015 to simplify 
  reporting with the release of the valuation allowance as disclosed in Note 12. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee 
  should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from both capital and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  
   9 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)". The standard is 
  intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share - based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update may be applied retrospectively or prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  All other ASUs issued and not yet effective for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and through the date of this report, were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 

3. 
    Liquidity and Management s Plans 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $18,338,000   of cash and cash equivalents.  The Company reported total current assets of approximately   $106,290,000   and current liabilities of approximately   $41,578,000   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company believes that its anticipated cash from operating and financing activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and availability under its line of credit will enable the Company to meet its operational liquidity needs and fund its planned investing activities for the next year. 

4. Acquisition of Stability Inc. 
    
  On January 13, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Stability Inc., d/b/a Stability Biologics ("Stability"), a provider of human tissue products to surgeons, facilities, and distributors serving the surgical, spine, and orthopedic sectors of the healthcare 
  industry. As a result of this transaction, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Stability in exchange for 
  $6,000,000   cash,   $3,346,000   in stock, represented by   441,009   shares of our common stock, and assumed debt of   $1,771,000  .  Additional one time costs incurred in connection with the transaction totaled   $1,088,000   and are included within selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Contingent consideration may be payable in a formula determined by sales less certain expenses for the years 2016 and 2017. As of September 30, 2016, the contingent consideration was valued at   $25,620,000   and is shown in the schedule below as fair value of earn-out. The Company used a third party specialist to assist us with the valuation. The contingent consideration was classified as a liability. 
    
  The Company has evaluated the contingent consideration for accounting purposes under GAAP and has determined that the 
  contingent consideration is within the scope of ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity" whereby a financial instrument, 
  other than an outstanding share, that embodies a conditional obligation that the issuer may settle by issuing a variable number 
  of its equity shares shall be classified as a liability if, at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or 
  predominantly on variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares. 
    
  The actual purchase price was based on cash paid, the fair value of our stock on the date of the acquisition, and direct costs 
  associated with the combination. The actual purchase price has been preliminarily allocated as of September 30, 2016 (in 
  thousands) and is subject to change: 

10 

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination as defined by FASB Topic 805 - "Business Combinations". The fair value of the contingent consideration is measured as a Level 3 instrument. The contingent consideration liability is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and will be remeasured quarterly until purchase accounting is completed based on the assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. The increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in anticipated revenue levels and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. As the fair value measured is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as  
  
   11 

Level 3. The income valuation approach was applied in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration using a discounted cash flow valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs comprised of projected sales and certain expenses. The values assigned to intangible assets are subject to amortization. The intangible assets were assigned the following lives for amortization purposes: 

Estimated useful life (in years) 
      Intangible asset: 

Customer relationships 
      
    12 
      Patents and know-how 
      
    20 
      Trade name and Trademarks 
      
    Indefinite 
      Non compete agreements 
      
    4 
      Licenses and permits 
      
    2 

Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price paid over the identifiable net assets and liabilities acquired at fair value. 
  Goodwill was determined using the residual method based on an independent appraisal of the assets and liabilities acquired in 
  the transaction and is preliminary as of September 30, 2016 and is subject to change. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as defined by FASB Topic 350 - "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other". 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma summary financial information presents the consolidated results of operations for the Company as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. The pro forma results are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had occurred on the date indicated or indicative of the results that may occur in the future. 
    
  Unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands) is as follows: 

The 2016 supplemental pro forma earnings were adjusted to exclude   $1,088,000   of acquisition-related legal, audit and other 
  costs, net of tax. The 2015 supplemental pro forma earnings were adjusted to include   $1,186,000   of amortization costs related to recorded intangible assets with defined useful lives, and   $1,471,000   of inventory step-up charges as a result of the acquisition for comparability to 2016. The number of shares outstanding used in calculating the income per share for 2015 was adjusted to include   441,009   shares issued as part of the purchase price and assumed to be issued on January 1, 2015. 

5. Short Term Investments 
  Short term investments consisted of approximately   $3,000,000   of FDIC insured certificates of deposit held with various financial institutions as of December 31, 2015. The cost of these instruments approximated their fair market value at December 31, 2015.

  Also included in net property and equipment is approximately   $1.0 million   in leasehold improvements paid for by the landlord of the Company's main facility with a corresponding liability included in other liabilities which is amortized over the term of the lease. 
  Depreciation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, was approximately   $2,394,000   and   $1,247,000  , respectively, and approximately   $838,000   and   $470,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

Within   30 days   after the receipt by the Company of approval by the FDA allowing the sale of the first licensed product, the Company is required to pay an additional   $200,000   to the licensor.  Due to its contingent nature, this amount is not recorded as a liability. The Company will also be required to pay a royalty of   3%   on all commercial sales revenue from the licensed products. The Company is also obligated to pay a   $50,000   minimum annual royalty payment over the life of the license. 
               (c) 
    Patents in Process consist of capitalized external legal and other registration costs in connection with internally developed tissue-based patents that are pending. Once issued, the costs associated with a given patent will be included in Patents   Know-How under intangible assets subject to amortization. 
      Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, was approximately   $1,889,000   and   $699,000  , respectively, and   $631,000   and   $234,000   for   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  Expected future amortization of intangible assets as of    September 30, 2016  , is as follows (in thousands): 

(a) Estimated amortization expense for the year ending December 31, 2016, includes only amortization to be recorded after   September 30, 2016  . 

9. Credit Facility 
    
  On October 12, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain 
  lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement establishes a senior secured revolving 
  credit facility in favor of the Company with a maturity date of October 12, 2018 and an aggregate lender commitment of up to 
  $50 million  . The Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility of up to   $35 million  , which can be 
  exercised as one or more revolving commitment increases or new term loans, all subject to certain customary terms and 
  conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus   1.5%   to   2.25%  . 
  Fees paid in connection with the initiation of the credit facility totaled approximately   $500,000  . These deferred financing costs 
  are being amortized to interest expense over the   three  -year life of the facility. The Credit Agreement contains customary 
  representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default. As of September 30, 2016, there were   no   outstanding revolving loans under the credit facility.

10. Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
  Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options, restricted stock, and warrants using the treasury stock method.  
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands except share data): 

(a) Securities outstanding that are included in the computation above, utilizing the treasury stock method are as follows: 

11. Equity 
  Stock Incentive Plans     
  The Company has   four   share-based compensation plans which provide for the granting of equity awards, including qualified incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation awards and restricted stock awards to employees, directors, consultants and advisors: the MiMedx Group, Inc. 2016 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), which was approved by shareholders on May 18, 2016; the MiMedx Group, Inc. Assumed 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Assumed 2006 Plan  the MiMedx Inc. 2007 Assumed Stock Plan (the  Assumed 2007 Plan  and the MiMedx Group Inc. Amended and Restated Assumed 2005 Stock Plan (the  Assumed 2005 Plan ). The awards are subject to a vesting schedule as set forth in each individual agreement. The Company currently intends to use only the 2016 Plan to make future grants.  

15 

Activity with respect to the stock options is summarized as follows: 

(a) 
    Includes forfeiture adjusted unvested shares. 
     The intrinsic value of the options exercised during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $5,283,449  .  
  Following is a summary of stock options outstanding and exercisable at   September 30, 2016  : 

Total unrecognized compensation expense related to granted stock options at   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $2,150,652   and will be charged to expense ratably through May 2017.  
  The fair value of options granted by the Company is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate.  Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of peer companies and other factors estimated over the expected term of the options.  The term of employee options granted is derived using the  simplified method,  which computes expected term as the mid point between the weighted average time to vesting and the contractual maturity.  The simplified method was used due to the Company's lack of sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded.  The term for non-employee options is generally based upon the contractual term of the option.  The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the period of the expected term or contractual term as described. 
  The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model are set forth in the following table: 
  
   16 

There were   no   options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Restricted Stock Awards                                                     
  Activity with respect to restricted stock awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized as follows:    

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $23,767,731   of total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to time-based, nonvested restricted stock.  That expense is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of   2.0   years, which approximates the remaining vesting period of these grants.  All shares noted above as unvested are considered issued and outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized stock-based compensation as follows (in thousands):  

Treasury Stock 
    On May 12, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $10 million   of our common stock from time to time, through December 31, 2014.  The Board subsequently extended the program until December 31, 2016.  In December 2014, the Board increased the authorization to   $20 million   and further increased the authorization in 2015 to   $60 million  .  The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon the Company's stock price, economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations. The Company may initiate, suspend or discontinue purchases under the stock repurchase program at any time. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   1,338,616   shares of its common stock for a purchase price of approximately   $10,338,000   before brokerage commissions of approximately   $40,000  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $3,936,000   of availability remaining under the repurchase program. 
  Additionally, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reissued   2,854,189   shares from the Treasury for restricted stock grants and stock option exercises, net of forfeitures, and as partial consideration to the shareholders of Stability, with an aggregate carrying value of approximately   $23,257,728  . 

17 

12. Income taxes    
    
  The effective tax rates for continuing operations of   31.5%   and   3.2%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, were determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate and include, in 2016, the impact of discrete items of approximately   $900,000  . The effective tax rate for the 2016 period increased approximately   28.3%   when compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to the   $15.4 million   valuation allowance release recorded in 2015 and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the valuation allowance previously recorded against the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, did not include the expense of the current period U.S. taxable income.  As of the end of September 2016, the projected annual effective tax rate for 2016 is approximately   41.0%  . 

13. Supplemental disclosure of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing activities: 
       
  Selected cash payments, receipts, and noncash activities are as follows (in thousands): 

14. Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  Contractual Commitments 
  In addition to the capital leases noted above in Note 7, the Company has entered into operating lease agreements for facility space and equipment.  These leases expire over the next   eight years   and generally contain renewal options.  The Company anticipates that most of these leases will be renewed or replaced upon expiration.  The Company also has commitments for meeting space and to various charitable organizations.  The estimated annual lease payments, meeting space and charitable organization commitments are as follows (in thousands): 

Rent expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, was approximately   $1,311,000   and   $956,000  , respectively, and was approximately   $453,000   and   $363,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and is allocated among cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Letters of Credit 
  As a condition of the lease for the Company's main facility, the Company is obligated under standby letters of credit in the amount of approximately   $103,000  .  These obligations are reduced at various times over the life of the lease. 
  FDA Untitled Letter and Draft Guidance 
  On August 28, 2013, the FDA issued an Untitled Letter alleging that the Company's micronized allografts do not meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and that, as a result, MiMedx would need a  
  
   18 

biologics license to lawfully market those micronized products. Since the issuance of the Untitled Letter, the Company has been in discussions with the FDA to communicate its disagreement with the FDA's assertion that the Company's allografts are more than minimally manipulated. To date, the FDA has not changed its position that the Company's micronized products are not eligible for marketing solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, but discussions are continuing. The Company continues to market its micronized products but is also pursuing the Biologics License Application ( BLA ) process for certain of its micronized products. 
    
  On December 22, 2014, the FDA issued for comment  Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Minimal Manipulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.  Essentially the Minimal Manipulation draft guidance takes the same position with respect to micronized amniotic tissue that the FDA took in the Untitled Letter to MiMedx 16 months earlier. The Company submitted comments asserting that the Minimal Manipulation draft guidance represents agency action that goes far beyond the FDA s statutory authority, is inconsistent with existing HCT/P regulations and the FDA s prior positions, and is internally inconsistent and scientifically unsound. On October 28, 2015, the FDA issued for comment, "Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Homologous Use of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products." The Company submitted comments on this Homologous Use draft guidance as well. On September 12 and 13, 2016, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain input on the Homologous Use draft guidance and the previously released Minimal Manipulation draft guidance, as well as other recently issued guidance documents on HCT/Ps. The Company awaits further decision from FDA on the draft guidances, but anticipates this will be a lengthy process. 
    
  If the FDA does allow the Company to continue to market a micronized form of its sheet allografts without a biologics license either prior to or after finalization of the draft guidance documents, it may impose conditions, such as labeling restrictions and compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Although the Company is preparing for these requirements in connection with its pursuit of a BLA for certain of its micronized products, earlier compliance with these conditions requires significant additional time and cost investments by the Company. It is also possible that the FDA will not allow the Company to market any form of a micronized product without a biologics license even prior to finalization of the draft guidance documents and could even require the Company to recall its micronized products. Revenues from micronized products comprised approximately   12%   of the Company's revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Patent Litigation 
    
  MiMedx continues to diligently enforce its intellectual property against several entities. Currently, there are   four   actions pending, as described below: 
    
  The Liventa Action 
    
  On April 22, 2014, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Liventa Bioscience, Inc. ("Liventa"), Medline Industries, Inc. ("Medline") and Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Inc. ("MTF") for permanent injunctive relief and unspecified damages (the "Liventa Action"). In addition to the allegations of infringement of MiMedx's patents, the lawsuit asserts that Liventa and Medline knowingly and willfully made false and misleading representations about their respective products to providers, patients, and in some cases, prospective investors. Though the terms of the agreement are confidential, the parties have reached an amicable settlement of the false advertising claims for an undisclosed sum. The patent infringement claims are still pending as described below. 
    
  MiMedx asserts that Liventa (formerly known as AFCell Medical, Inc.), Medline and MTF infringed and continue to infringe certain of the Company's patents relating to the MiMedx dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane ("dHACM") allografts. MTF is the tissue processor while Liventa and Medline are the distributors of the allegedly infringing products. On May 30, 2014, defendants filed answers to the Complaint, denying the allegations in the Complaint. They also raised affirmative defenses of non-infringement, invalidity, laches and estoppel. MTF and Medline also filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity. Defendants filed parallel Inter Partes Review ("IPR") proceedings which are discussed below. We expect the case to go to trial in 2017. 
    
  The Bone Bank Action 
    
  On May 16, 2014, the Company also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Transplant Technology, Inc. d/b/a Bone Bank Allografts ("Bone Bank") and Texas Human Biologics, Ltd. ("Biologics") for permanent injunctive relief and unspecified damages (the "Bone Bank Action"). The Bone Bank Action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. This lawsuit similarly asserts that Bone Bank and Biologics infringed certain of the Company's patents through the manufacturing and sale of their placental-derived tissue graft products. On July 10, 2014, Defendants filed an answer to the Complaint, denying the allegations in the Complaint. They also raised affirmative defenses of non-infringement and invalidity  
  
   19 

and filed counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity. Defendants also filed parallel IPR proceedings which are further discussed below. Discovery is closed and we expect the case to go to trial in the early part of 2017. 
    
  The NuTech Action 
    
  On March 2, 2015, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against NuTech Medical, Inc. ("NuTech") and DCI Donor Services, Inc. ("DCI") for permanent injunctive relief and unspecified damages. This lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The lawsuit alleges that NuTech and DCI have infringed and continue to infringe the Company's patents through the manufacture, use, sale, and/or offering of their tissue graft product. The lawsuit also asserts that NuTech knowingly and willfully made false and misleading representations about its products to customers and/or prospective customers. The case is currently in the discovery phase. 
    
  The Vivex Action 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Company also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Vivex BioMedical ( Vivex ) for permanent injunctive relief and unspecified damages (the "Vivex Action"). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The patent at issue is the 8,709,494 patent (the "494" patent). Vivex answered MiMedx s Complaint and filed Counterclaims of noninfringement and invalidity.     
    
  Pending IPRs 
    
  In addition to defending the claims in the pending district court litigations, defendants in the Liventa and Bone Bank cases have challenged certain of the Company's patents in several IPR proceedings to avoid the high burden of proof of proving invalidity by "clear and convincing evidence" in the district court litigations. An inter partes review (or "IPR") is a request for a specialized group within the United States Patent and Trademark Office to review the validity of a plaintiff's patent claims. The defendants in the Bone Bank Action challenged the validity of the Company's 8,597,687 (the "687" patent) and the 494 patent; while the defendants in the Liventa Action challenged the validity of the Company's 8,372,437 and 8,323,701 patents (the "'437" and "'701" patents, respectively). 
    
  On June 29, 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board ("PTAB") denied the Bone Bank defendants' request for institution of an IPR with respect to the '494 patent (EpiFix) on all   seven   challenged grounds. On August 18, 2015, the PTAB also denied the Liventa defendants' request for institution of an IPR with respect to the '701 patent (AmnioFix) on all   six   challenged grounds. That is, the PTAB decided in each case that the defendants failed to establish a reasonable likelihood that defendants would prevail in showing any of the challenged claims of the '494 or the '701 patent were unpatentable. 
    
  On July 10, 2015, the PTAB issued an opinion allowing a review of the '687 patent to proceed, although on only   two   of the   five   challenged grounds. The parties decided to forego oral arguments. On July 7, 2016, the PTAB issued an opinion finding that the challenged claims, which relate to embossment and not configuration, were invalid for obviousness. On August 18, 2015, the PTAB issued an opinion allowing a review of the '437 patent to proceed, although only on   one   of the   seven   challenged grounds. On August 16, 2016, the PTAB issued an opinion finding that the challenged claims were unpatentable.  MiMedx has filed a notice of appeal of the PTAB s decision regarding the '437 patent.

  Recent Events 
    
  On December 22, 2014, the FDA issued for comment  Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Minimal Manipulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.  Essentially the Minimal Manipulation draft guidance takes the same position with respect to micronized amniotic tissue that the FDA took in the Untitled Letter to MiMedx 16 months earlier. The Company submitted comments asserting that the Minimal Manipulation draft guidance represents agency action that goes far beyond the FDA s statutory authority, is inconsistent with existing HCT/P regulations and the FDA s prior positions, and is internally inconsistent and scientifically unsound. On October 28, 2015, the FDA issued for comment, "Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Homologous Use of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products." The Company submitted comments on this Homologous Use draft guidance as well. On September 12 and 13, 2016, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain input on the Homologous Use draft guidance and the previously released Minimal Manipulation draft guidance, as well as other recently issued guidance documents on HCT/Ps. The Company awaits further decision from FDA on the draft guidances, but anticipates this will be a lengthy process.

Selling expense increases were driven by costs associated with expanding the Company's direct sales organization, increased commissions due to higher sales volume, an increase in share-based compensation, and the addition of staff and normal operating costs of Stability.  Additional spending increases included one time costs of approximately $1,088,000 related to the acquisition of Stability, support costs related to medical reimbursement, accounting, information technology infrastructure to help manage the growth of the business, and legal costs due to patent litigation.  Selling, General and Administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, professional fees, sales commissions, sales training costs, industry trade show fees and expenses, product promotion and product literature costs, facilities costs and other sales, marketing and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation.   
  Income Taxes 
              The nine month effective tax rate of 31.5% includes discrete items related to certain favorable provision to return adjustments resulting from the recently filed 2015 income tax returns and a deferred tax rate adjustment.  This rate is an increase of approximately   28%   when compared to the same period of  2015, primarily due to the  valuation allowance release recorded in 2015 and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
          As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $18.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents.  The Company reported total current assets of approximately   $106.3 million   and total current liabilities of approximately   $41.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which represents a current ratio of 2.6 as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  On October 12, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement established a senior secured revolving credit facility in favor of the Company, with an aggregate lender commitment of up to $50 million. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding revolving loans under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility of up to $35 million, which can be exercised as one or more revolving commitment increases or new term loans, all subject to certain customary terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and events of default for senior secured credit agreements of this type. The covenants include (a) a requirement for the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00; (b) a requirement for the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00; and (c) a requirement for the Company to maintain minimum liquidity of $10 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Stability, the Company paid approximately $6 million in cash for the initial purchase price, paid off debt of approximately $1.8 million and provided initial working capital of approximately $4 million. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,338,616 shares of its common stock for a purchase price of approximately $10,338,000, before brokerage commissions of approximately $40,000 bringing the total amount spent under the program to approximately $56,064,000 since inception.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $3,936,000 of availability remaining under the repurchase program.  The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon the Company's stock price, economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations. The Company may initiate, suspend or discontinue purchases under the stock repurchase program at any time. 
   In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 109,394 shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock. 
  We believe that our anticipated cash from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, and availability under the Credit Agreement will enable us to meet our operational liquidity needs and fund our planned investing activities for the next year.

Contingencies 
  See Note 14 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 herein. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  Contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods.  The table below summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Discussion of cash flows 
  Net cash from operations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased approximately $5.4 million to approximately $  9.1 million  , compared to   $14.5 million   from operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily attributable to a decrease in net income compared to the prior year, as well as post acquisition working capital costs for Stability. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating cash decreased approximately $4.5 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net income compared to the prior year, as well as post acquisition working capital costs for Stability.  
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was approximately   $10.4 million  , compared to approximately   $2.3 million   for 2015.  Cash used for the acquisition of Stability totaled $7.6 million, and an additional $5.3 million was used for the purchase of equipment to expand production capacity, partially offset by maturing certificates of deposit of $3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cash utilized for investing activities increased approximately $600,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to maturing certificates of deposit which occurred in 2015. 
  Net cash used in financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased approximately $8.9 million to $8.8 million compared to $17.7 million of cash used during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included approximately $11.3 million for stock repurchases compared to $21.1 million in the prior year.  Additionally, the Company received $2.5 million from the exercise of stock options compared to approximately $3.5 million in the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cash utilized for financing activities increased by   $2.8 million   as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a greater amount of stock repurchases in 2016. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In addition to our GAAP results, we provide certain Non-GAAP metrics including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per share. The Company believes that the presentation of these measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding the Company's performance.   These measurements are not a substitute for GAAP measurements, although Company management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company's on-going financial performance from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP Net Income excluding: (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) other income (expense), (iii) interest income and expense, (iv) income taxes,  (v) one time acquisition related costs, (vi) the effect of purchase accounting due to acquisitions and (vii) share-based compensation expense.   Due to the impact of the acquisition of Stability in January 2016 and the release of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset on reported tax expense in 2015 on results, the Company has decided to provide additional adjusted non-GAAP measures to provide comparability of normal ongoing operating results. Beginning in 2016, the Company has reported Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS to normalize results for comparison purposes.  Adjusted Gross Margin consists of GAAP gross margin excluding amortization of inventory fair value step-up. Adjusted Net  
  
   25 

Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per share consists of GAAP net income excluding: (i) one time acquisition related costs, (ii) amortization of inventory fair value step-up, (iii) amortization of intangible assets and (iv) share-based compensation. Reconciliations of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP Gross Margin to Adjusted Gross Margin and GAAP Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 appear in the tables below. 
  The Company's Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $11.4 million   which is a reduction of   $(0.4) million   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The reduction was attributable to increased investments in support of growth of the business compared to the prior year.   The Company's Adjusted EBITDA for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $30.5 million   which is a reduction of   $(0.6) million    as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The reduction was attributable to increased investments in support of growth of the business compared to the prior year.

*Assumes a normalized tax rate of 42% for 2015 and 41% for 2016. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  In preparing financial statements, the Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations. Management continually reviews the Company's accounting policies and financial information disclosures. A summary of  significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements was provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  During the quarter covered by this report, there were no material changes to the accounting policies and assumptions previously disclosed. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  For the effect of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Based on our lack of market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016, we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of such date. 
  
   27 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
  The Company has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure procedures and controls or its internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are a party to various legal claims and actions incidental to our business. These items are more fully discussed in Note 14 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors  
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .    
   
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Stock Repurchases     
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding the purchases of the Company s equity securities made by or on behalf of the Company or any affiliated purchaser (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 10b-18) during the three month period ended September 30, 2016: 

28 

(a) Shares repurchased during the quarter include 27,800 shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock. 
    
  (b) On May 12, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of our common stock from time to time, through December 31, 2014. The Board subsequently extended the program until December 31, 2016. In December 2014, the Board increased the authorization to a total of $20 million and further increased the authorization in 2015 to a total of $60 million. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon the Company's stock price, economic and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate considerations. The Company may initiate, suspend or discontinue purchases under the stock repurchase program at any time. The above table sets forth information regarding the purchases of the Company s equity securities made under the repurchase program during the quarter prior to brokerage commissions of approximately $28,000.
