MAD CATZ INTERACTIVE, INC.   
     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)  
   
 (1) Basis of Presentation  
 Nature of Operations  
 Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. ( Mad Catz ) designs, manufactures (primarily through third parties in Asia), markets and distributes innovative interactive entertainment products marketed under its Mad Catz      (gaming) and Tritton      (audio) brands. Mad Catz products, which primarily include headsets, mice, keyboards, controllers, specialty controllers, and other accessories, cater to gamers across multiple platforms including in-home gaming consoles, handheld gaming consoles, PC and Mac computers, smart phones, tablets and other smart devices. Mad Catz distributes its products through many leading retailers around the globe. Mad Catz is incorporated in Canada and is operationally headquartered in San Diego, California. Mad Catz also maintains offices in Europe and Asia.  
 Basis of Accounting  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial information has been prepared by management, without audit, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2016 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date; however, it does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ).  
 The Company has incurred recurring losses from operations in each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2016, generated negative cash flows from operations in the year ended March 31, 2016 and has negative working capital as of September 30, 2016.  The Company expects to generate income from operations and cash flow in fiscal 2017, excluding sales and related expenses of Rock Band 4 products, by reducing its operating expenses as a result of the restructuring plan executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and through the sale of certain assets associated with the Company s flight, space, and farm simulation product line.  To meet its capital needs, the Company is also considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, equity sales under its  at-the-market  ( ATM ) equity offering program, additional equity financings, debt financings and other funding transactions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its fiscal 2017 financial plan or complete financing transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. If the Company is unable to become cash-flow positive or to raise additional capital as and when needed, or upon acceptable terms, such failure would have a significant negative impact on its financial condition. 
 Our primary operating subsidiary, Mad Catz, Inc. ( MCI ), maintains a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Sterling National Bank ( SNB ) to provide for a $20.0 million revolving line of credit subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventories, which changes throughout the year. The Loan Agreement expires on June 30, 2018. The Company is required to meet a monthly financial covenant based on a trailing twelve months  Adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ), as defined. Additionally, Mad Catz Europe Ltd. ( MCE ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, maintains a Master Facilities Agreement (the  Facilities Agreement ) with Faunus Group International, Inc. ( FGI ) to provide for a $10.0 million secured demand credit facility subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventories, which changes throughout the year. The Facilities Agreement has a three-year term, although FGI may terminate the facility at any time upon at least three months  notice. 
 The Company depends upon the availability of capital under the Loan Agreement and Facilities Agreement to finance operations. The Company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future sales and expenses. If the Company is unable to comply with the Adjusted EBITDA covenants contained in the Loan Agreement, as amended from time to time, SNB could declare the outstanding borrowings under the facility immediately due and payable. If the Company needs to obtain additional funds as a result of the termination of the Loan Agreement or Facilities Agreement or the acceleration of amounts due thereunder, there can be no assurance that alternative financing can be obtained on substantially similar or acceptable terms, or at all. The Company s failure to promptly obtain alternate financing could limit our ability to implement our business plan and have an immediate, severe and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In the event that no alternative financing is available, the Company would be forced to drastically curtail operations, or dispose of assets, or cease operations altogether.  
 In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the interim period presented reflect all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations as of and for such periods indicated. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes hereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements refer to the Company s fiscal years ending March 31 as its  fiscal  years. The Company generates a substantial percentage of net sales in the last three months of every calendar year, its fiscal  
 7 

third quarter. Results for the int  erim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be reported for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. All currency amounts are presented in U.S. dollars.  
 Principles of Consolidation  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mad Catz and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. References to the  Company,   we,   us,   our  and other similar words refer to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise.  
 Use of Estimates  
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Applying these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to asset impairments, reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, contingencies and litigation, valuation and recognition of share-based payments, warrant liabilities and income taxes. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates.  
 Sale of Saitek Assets 
 On September 15, 2016, the Company completed the sale of certain assets associated with the Company s flight, space, and farm simulation product line (the  Saitek assets ) to certain subsidiaries of Logitech International S.A. (collectively,  Logitech ) (see Note 7).                      
 The Company has followed the guidance in ASC 205-20,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Discontinued Operations,  as updated by Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08,  Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity . The Saitek assets do not represent a component of an entity, and therefore, the sale of the Saitek assets has not been presented as discontinued operations.  
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards  
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows, which addresses specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the updated standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, which amends  several aspects of share-based payment accounting. This guidance requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, with prospective application required. The guidance also changes the classification of such tax benefits or tax deficiencies on the statement of cash flows from a financing activity to an operating activity, with retrospective or prospective application allowed. Additionally, the guidance requires the classification of employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows, with retrospective application required.  This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which amends  the existing accounting standards for lease accounting and requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months, including those classified as operating leases. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs. Consistent with current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), the presentation of expenses and cash flows will depend primarily on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. The new standard also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases in order to provide additional information about the nature of an organization s leasing activities.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,  
 8 

2018. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable value,  thereby simplifying the current guidance under which and entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. For public business entities, the ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. The Company has elected to early adopt, prospectively, this guidance effective April 1, 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debit Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. This ASU clarified the guidance in ASC 2015-03 stating that the SEC staff would not object to a company presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement on the balance sheet as a deferred asset, regardless of whether there were any outstanding borrowings at period-end. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted these standards on a retrospective basis as of April 1, 2016. The Company will continue to defer and present the debt issuance costs related to its Loan Agreement and Facilities Agreement in Other assets and amortize them ratably over the term of the agreement.  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period subsequent to the date of the financial statements. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance is effective for all entities for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. As the requirements of this literature are disclosure only, adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company s financial condition or results of operations.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB agreed to defer by one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption as of the original effective date permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.  

(2) Fair Value Measurements  
 The carrying values of the Company s financial instruments, including cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes receivable/payable approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the bank loans and notes payable approximates their fair value as the interest rate and other terms are that which is currently available to the Company. 
 For a description of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 2 to the Company s 2016 consolidated financial statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  
 The following tables provide a summary of the recognized assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):  

9 

The following table provides a roll forward of the Company s level three fair value measurements during the six months ended September 30, 2016, which consist of the Company s warrant liabilities (in thousands):  

(3) Inventories  
 Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):  

Although the Company has sold all of the remaining inventory of products designed for the Rock Band 4 video game, a portion of the inventory was sold to a customer under extended payment terms that did not meet the criteria to be recognized as revenue in the current period under GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Therefore, $3.6 million of products designed for the Rock Band 4 video game is included in inventory as of September 30, 2016. 

4) Restricted Cash  
 Cash accounts that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage are presented as restricted cash. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $180,000 of restricted cash held by a bank in deposit accounts. This amount represents payments from customers into restricted bank accounts on September 30, 2016 that were subsequently automatically swept to repay borrowings under our bank loans.

(5) Securities Purchase Agreements   
 2015 Securities Purchase Agreement  
 On March 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2015 Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company sold (a) an aggregate of 8,980,773 shares of its common stock (the  2015 Shares ) and (b) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,490,387 shares of common stock of the Company ( 2015 Warrants  and, together with the 2015 Shares, the  2015 Securities ). The 2015 Securities were issued at a price equal to $0.41 for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3,682,000. The 2015 Warrants became exercisable on September 24, 2015 at a per share exercise price equal to $0.61 and expire on September 24, 2020. The 2015 Warrants are subject to limitation on exercise if the Holder or its affiliates would beneficially own more than 9.99%/4.99% of the total number of the Company s shares of common stock following such exercise. The 2015 Warrants also provide that in the event of a Company Controlled Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the 2015 Warrants), the Company may, at the election of the 2015 Warrant holder, be required to redeem all or a portion of the 2015 Warrants for cash in an amount equal to the Black-Scholes option pricing model value. As a result of this cash settlement provision, the 2015 Warrants are classified as liabilities and carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in net income (loss) until such time as the 2015 Warrants are exercised or expire. The fair value of the 2015 Warrants decreased from $300,000 as of March 31, 2016 to $297,000 as of September 30, 2016, which resulted in a $3,000 gain from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the six months ended September 30, 2016. The 2015 Warrants are not traded in an active securities market, and as such, the Company estimates the fair value of the of the warrant liability using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: 

Expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the 2015 Warrants. The Company believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of the Company s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the 2015 Warrants. The Company currently has no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of the 2015 Warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the 2015 Warrants. The risk-free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the Federal Reserve Board that is closest to the expected term of the 2015 Warrants.  
 Fluctuations in the fair value of the 2015 Warrants are impacted by unobservable inputs, most significantly the Company s common stock market price. Significant increases (decreases) in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.  
 2011 Securities Purchase Agreement 
 In April 2011, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2011 Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company sold (a) an aggregate of 6,352,293 shares of its common stock (the  2011 Shares ) and (b) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,540,918 shares of common stock of the Company ( 2011 Warrants  and, together with the 2011 Shares, the  2011 Securities ). The 2011 Securities were issued at a price equal to $1.92 for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $12,196,000. The 2011 Warrants became exercisable on October 21, 2011 at a per share exercise price equal to $2.56 and expire on October 21, 2016. The 2011 Warrants contain provisions that adjust the exercise price in the event the Company pays stock dividends, effects stock splits or issues additional shares of common stock at a price per share less than the exercise price of the 2011 Warrants.  
 The Company accounts for the 2011 Warrants with exercise price reset features as liabilities carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in net income (loss) until such time as the 2011 Warrants are exercised or expire. As a result of the March 2015 offering, described above, and pursuant to the terms of the 2011 Warrants, the exercise price of the 2011 Warrants was adjusted to $2.30 per share. 
 The fair value of the 2011 Warrants remained consistent at $0 as of March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, which resulted in no gain or loss from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the six months ended September 30, 2016.  
 11 

The 2011 Warrants are not traded in an active securities market, and as such, the Company estimated the fair value of the 2011 Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following as  sumptions:   

Expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility. Historical volatility is computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the 2011 Warrants. The Company believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of the Company s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these 2011 Warrants. The Company currently has no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these 2011 Warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the 2011 Warrants. The risk-free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the Federal Reserve Board that is closest to the expected term of the 2011 Warrants.  
 Fluctuations in the fair value of the 2011 Warrants are impacted by unobservable inputs, most significantly the assumption with regards to future equity issuances and their impact to the down-round protection feature. Significant increases in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement.  

(6) Restructuring and Severance Charges  
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management initiated a restructuring plan in order to lower operating costs, increase efficiencies and better align the Company s workforce with the needs of the business. In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company incurred total restructuring and related charges of approximately $2,990,000 in fiscal 2016, primarily related to severance and benefits afforded to terminated employees and officers. 
 The following table summarizes the restructuring and severance costs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

Employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. 
   
 Other costs consist primarily of costs to exit auto leases and other costs directly related to employee terminations in certain European locations. 

( 7) Sale of Saitek Assets   
 On September 15, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Saitek assets to Logitech. Logitech acquired all of the specific trademarks, equipment and tooling, inventory, technical data and records, and other related documents necessary for the designing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing of interactive flight, space, and farm simulation controllers previously marketed and sold by the Company primarily under the  Saitek  brand. Additionally, at their option, eight Mad Catz research and development employees resigned from the Company and accepted employment offers with Logitech. The Company received $11.0 million in cash at closing and $2.0 million was deposited in escrow with Bank of America, National Association, to fund any post-closing adjustments or claims. The Company recognized a net gain of $8.2 million on the sale of the Saitek assets, which is reflected in  Net gain on sale of Saitek assets  in its unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016. Title to all assets acquired by Logitech transferred upon closing. The net gain recognized does not include the two $1.0 million deposits made into the tooling and general escrow accounts by Logitech. The $1.0 million deposited in the tooling escrow account is eligible to be released on April 30, 2017 pending the completion of specific contractual deliverables, including transfer, setup, and testing of  
 12 

tooling. Any amounts recognized from this escrow account will be decreased by any Logitech claims and external costs incurred to complete the tooling transfers. The Compan  y believes that the fair value of the remaining obligation is less than the $1.0 million in escrow and is deferring the full amount as it is contingent upon completion of the specified deliverables in accordance with the transaction documents. The $1.0 mil  lion deposited in the general escrow account is eligible to be released on September 15, 2017. Any amounts from this account may be decreased by claims made by Logitech. The Company is not currently aware of any outstanding claims against the general escro  w account.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the transaction, the Company and Logitech also entered into several ancillary agreements as part of the transaction, including an Escrow Agreement governing the terms of the $2.0 million in escrow and a Transition Services Agreement governing the delivery of certain services and deliverables by the Company after completion of the transaction. 

(8) Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share  
 Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities unless inclusion of such securities would be anti-dilutive.  
 Outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 4,752,069 and 5,179,807 shares of the Company s common stock for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 7,939,958 and 7,930,617 shares of the Company s common stock for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income (loss) per share calculations because of their anti-dilutive effect during these periods. Outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,031,305 shares of the Company s common stock for each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were excluded from the diluted net income (loss) per share calculations because of their anti-dilutive effect during these periods.

 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our  refer, collectively, to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, and all references in this section to  Mad Catz  refer to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc.  
 This section contains forward-looking statements and forward looking information (collectively  forward-looking statements ) as defined in applicable securities legislation involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out under  Forward-looking Statements  herein and in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and in Part II Other Information   Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  
 OVERVIEW  
 Our Business  
 We design, manufacture (primarily through third parties in Asia), market and distribute innovative interactive entertainment products marketed under our Mad Catz    (gaming) and Tritton    (audio) brands. Our products, which primarily include headsets, mice, keyboards, controllers, specialty controllers, and other accessories, cater to gamers across multiple platforms including in-home gaming consoles, handheld gaming consoles, PC and Mac computers, smart phones, tablets and other smart devices. We distribute our products through many leading retailers around the globe. Mad Catz is incorporated in Canada and is operationally headquartered in San Diego, California. We also maintain offices in Europe and Asia.  
 Seasonality and Fluctuation of Sales  
 We generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year, our fiscal third quarter. Our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future, as a result of many factors, including: seasonal influences on our sales; unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends; the introduction of new videogame platforms or titles; the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season; and timing of introductions of new products.  
 Foreign Currency  
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, approximately 33% of total net sales were transacted outside of the Americas. The majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the U.S. dollar will cause foreign currency exchange gains and losses, which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience. Due to the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, among other factors, we cannot predict the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. There can be no assurances that we will not experience foreign currency exchange losses in the future. To date, we have not hedged against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in the future.  
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates remain consistent with those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 Net Sales  
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, net sales decreased 62% and 51%, respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. We experienced decreases in net sales in all regions driven primarily by decreased sales of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game, which launched in September 2015. Additionally, during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced increases in permanent and temporary price concessions due to promotional pricing programs with retailers to drive sell-through of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of products designed for consoles, particularly audio. We have started launching a new line of audio products designed for consoles for this holiday season, which we believe will continue to drive growth in audio sales. Declines in sales of our products designed for the PC and Mac, which represented 10% and 13% of our sales during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 8% and 11% during the same periods in prior year,   are due primarily to an  
 15 

increase in aggressive pricing competition in mice and keyboards, particularly in EMEA, and an aging product line. We have started launching a refresh of our gaming mice, w  hich we believe will drive growth in this category. We also experienced a decrease in sales of products developed for smart devices, which represented 2% and 3% of our sales during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, down from   3% and 5% during the same periods in prior year, driven primarily by controllers sold in APAC under a private label program in the prior year that did not recur in the current year.  
 From a geographical perspective, our net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):  

Our sales by platform as a percentage of gross sales were as follows (a):  

Our sales by product category as a percentage of gross sales were as follows (a):

Our sales by brand as a percentage of gross sales were as follows (a):   

(a)   
 
 Sales of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game and simulation products sold as part of the sale of Saitek assets are listed separately in each of the tables to provide comparable information for our ongoing product lines.      

Gross profit  
 Gross profit is defined as net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of product costs, cost of licenses and royalties, write-downs of inventory, cost of freight-in and freight-out and distribution center costs, including depreciation and other overhead costs.  
 The following table presents net sales, cost of sales and gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  

Gross profit for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 94% and 96%, respectively, due to the decrease in net sales, as well as the decrease in gross profit margin to 4% and 2% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 23% in each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin over the prior year periods was due primarily to an increase in permanent and temporary price concessions, which are recorded as a reduction in net sales. The increase in permanent and temporary price concessions was due to additional promotional pricing programs with retailers, primarily in EMEA and the Americas, to drive sell-through of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game. Additionally, product mix and additional freight expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 placed downward pressure on gross margin. We expect gross margin for the full year fiscal 2017 to decrease compared to fiscal 2016. We expect normalized gross margin for our ongoing Tritton and Mad Catz products to be between 20% and 24%, based on seasonality.  The decrease over previous expectations is due to the loss of Saitek product sales, which historically generated higher gross margins than our other products, and a lower sales base to cover fixed distribution costs. 
 17 

Operating Expenses   
 Operating expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):  

Sales and Marketing Expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll, commissions and travel costs for our worldwide sales and marketing staff, advertising expense and costs of operating our websites. The decrease in sales and marketing expense during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to prior year periods was primarily due to expense savings realized as a result of the restructuring activities implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, as well as lower cooperative advertising expense related to Rock Band 4 products. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the full year fiscal 2017, on an absolute dollar basis, to decrease compared to fiscal 2016 levels.   
 General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for our executive and administrative personnel, facilities costs and professional services, such as legal and accounting. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to prior year periods was primarily related to expense savings realized as a result of the restructuring activities implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect general and administrative expenses for the full year fiscal 2017, on an absolute dollar basis, to decrease from fiscal 2016 levels.   
 Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses include the costs of developing and enhancing new and existing products. The decrease in research and development expenses during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to prior year periods was primarily related to expense savings realized as a result of the restructuring activities implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect research and development expenses for the full year fiscal 2017, on an absolute dollar basis, to decrease compared to fiscal 2016 levels.   
 Restructuring and Severance Costs.  In fiscal 2017, we released $106,000 in restructuring and severance costs recognized in the year ended March 31, 2016, resulting from lower employer paid taxes on severance payments. These releases were partially offset by $103,000 of additional restructuring and severance costs incurred as a result of additional severance costs for impacted employees and terminating a warehouse agreement.   
 Amortization of Intangibles Expenses.  Amortization of intangibles expenses consist of the amortization of the acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions. We expect amortization of intangibles for the full year fiscal 2017, on an absolute dollar basis, to decrease compared to fiscal 2016 levels, due to the sale of the Saitek assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.   
 18 

Other Income (Expense)  
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding debt, foreign currency exchange gains or losses, change in fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreements entered into by the Company in 2011 and 2015, and other items that may be specific to a reporting period. The foreign currency exchange gains or losses are associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, which include the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese Yuan Renminbi ( CNY ), against the U.S. Dollar. Other income (expense) increased to $60,000 and $236,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $(1,379,000) and $(1,609,000) for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The change is primarily due to an increase in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities to a gain of $49,000 and $3,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from a loss of $(871,000) and $(917,000) for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Additionally, the change is due to an increase in foreign exchange gain to $286,000 and $820,000 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from foreign exchange loss of $(154,000) and $(93,000) in the same periods last year due primarily to changes in the exchange rates between the Pound Sterling and the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense, net, to $(277,000) and $(610,000) and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $(364,000) and $(621,000) in the same periods last year due to lower debt balances during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods last year. 
 Income Tax Expense  
 The income tax expense of $458,000 and $1,091,000, reflect effective tax rates of 10% and (210)% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense of $719,000 and $1,064,000, reflect effective tax rates of 11,983% and (24)% for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate is a blended rate for the different jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates depending on the taxable income in each jurisdiction and the statutory income tax rates in those jurisdictions, in which we do business. The income tax expense in the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 is the result of income tax recorded on the profitability of entities for which we no longer have valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets but not off setting income tax benefit for losses generated in our Hong Kong entity due to full valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. In addition, the income tax expense in the six months ended September 30, 2016 includes tax expense related to cancellations of stock options and the reversal of deferred tax assets related to the sale of the Saitek assets. 
 We do not record deferred income taxes on the approximate $24.5 million of undistributed earnings of our non-Canadian subsidiaries based upon our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings. We may be subject to income and withholding taxes if earnings of the non-Canadian subsidiaries were distributed. Considering the tax loss carry forwards in Canada and the related valuation allowance, the deferred tax liability on our undistributed earnings would be no more than $1.1 million at September 30, 2016.  
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 The table below provides a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):  

Our cash balance was $1.2 million and $2.4 million at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Additionally, our restricted cash balance was $180,000 and $680,000 at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Our primary sources of liquidity include borrowings under our Loan Agreement and Facilities Agreement (as discussed below under Financing Activities), cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and net proceeds from the sale of the Saitek assets. We may also supplement our cash flows from operations with proceeds from our at-the-market equity offering program ( ATM program ), although we have not done so to date. Due to the seasonality of our business (as discussed below under Operating Activities) cash provided by (used in) operating activities will fluctuate throughout our fiscal year.  
 19 

Equity Offerings  
 On November 4, 2015, the Company established an ATM program which allows us to sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of our common stock. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2016 and the six months ended September 30, 2016, we issued no shares of common stock under the program. 
 Operating Activities  
 Our cash flows from operating activities have typically included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of our products, offset by payments to vendors for materials and manufacture of our products. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflects a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.6 million and the net loss for the period before non-cash items (i.e. net gain on sale of Saitek assets, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and provision for deferred income taxes). These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.2 million and a decrease in inventory of $3.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflects the net loss for the period before non-cash items (i.e. depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and provision for deferred income taxes), a $19.8 million increase in accounts receivable resulting from the increase in net sales and an increase in inventory of $17.6 million as we started to build inventory, due to forecasted demand. These decreases in operating cash flow were offset partially by a $31.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to inventory purchases, accrued royalties and timing of payments. We are focused on effectively managing our overall liquidity position by continuously monitoring expenses and inventory levels and managing our accounts receivable collection efforts.  
 Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically experience a large build-up in inventories beginning during our second fiscal quarter ending September 30, with corresponding increases in accounts payable and our bank loan balance. These increases are in anticipation of the holiday selling season, which occurs during our third fiscal quarter ending December 31. However, due to the sale of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game and supply constraints, inventory decreased during our second fiscal quarter ended September 31, 2016. Additionally, accounts payable also decreased during this second fiscal quarter due to utilizing net proceeds from the sale of Saitek assets to reduce outstanding overdue balances with our vendors. A large percentage of our annual sales are generated during our third fiscal quarter and, typically, our inventories decrease and accounts receivable increase as a result of the annual holiday selling. However, due to sales of products related to the Rock Band 4 video game being less than originally forecasted during the holiday selling season, inventory levels increased during the third fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2015. During our fourth fiscal quarter ending March 31, the sales cycle completes with decreases in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and bank loan and net increase in cash. We forecast the expected demand for the holiday selling season months in advance to ensure adequate quantities of inventory. Our sales personnel forecast holiday sales based on information received from our major customers as to expected product purchases for the holiday season, and we also utilize mathematical modeling techniques to forecast demand based on recent point-of-sale activity. If demand does not meet expectations, the result will be excess inventories, and/or reduced sales and the overall effect could result in a reduction to cash flows from operating activities following payment of accounts payable.  
 Investing Activities  
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 of $10.2 million includes net proceeds from the sale of the Saitek assets of $10.6 million partially offset by capital expenditures to support our operations and were made up primarily of production molds, and to a lesser extent, computers and machinery and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2015 of $1.3 million mostly consisted of capital expenditures to support our operations and were made up primarily of production molds, and to a lesser extent, computers and machinery and equipment. 
 Financing Activities  
 Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016 of $5.1 million was primarily the result of net repayments under our Loan Agreement and Facilities Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2015 of $10.8 million was the result of net borrowings under our line of credit offset partially by repayments on a note payable. The changes in restricted cash of $500,000 represent the change in the payments from customers into a restricted bank account from March 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016 that were automatically swept to repay borrowings under our bank loans. 
 MCI maintains a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Sterling National Bank ( SNB ) to provide for a $20.0 million revolving line of credit subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventories, which changes throughout the year. The Loan Agreement expires on June 30, 2018. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, SNB will advance MCI up to 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivables, depending on dilution rates. Also, MCI may borrow against eligible inventory, subject to an inventory sublimit amount and certain other conditions. The inventory sublimit amount will be the lesser of 85% of net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, 60% of the lower of cost or net realizable value of eligible inventory, or 2.3333 times  
 20 

(which can be modified from time to time with approval from SNB) eligible accounts receivable under the Loan Agre  ement. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement accrue interest on the daily outstanding balance at 4.5% plus 30-day LIBOR rate per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%. MCI is also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.0% of the facility upon entry into the   Loan Agreement, an unused line fee equal to 0.25% per annum of the unused portion of the facility and a collateral monitoring fee of $1,500 per month. We are required to meet a monthly financial covenant based on a trailing twelve months  Adjusted EBITDA,   as defined. Our trailing twelve months  Adjusted EBITDA as of August 31, 2016 was lower than the required threshold and, accordingly, we were not in compliance with this covenant as of August 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, we received a waiver of the cove  nant default from SNB. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants. For periods subsequent to September 30, 2016, we believe we will be able to meet the covenants.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the   covenants subsequent to September 30, 2016 or that we would be able to obtain waivers from SNB to the extent we are not in compliance with the covenants. Additionally, MCE maintains a Master Facilities Agreement (the  Facilities Agreement ) with Faunus Gro  up International, Inc. ( FGI ) to provide for a $10.0 million secured demand credit facility subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventories, which changes throughout the year. The Facilities Agreement has a three-year term, alt  hough FGI may terminate the facility at any time upon at least three months  notice. Pursuant to the Facilities Agreement, FGI will advance MCE up to 85% of the value of eligible accounts receivable, depending on dilution rates. Also, MCE may borrow agains  t eligible inventory, subject to an inventory sublimit amount and certain other conditions.   
 We believe that our available cash balances, anticipated cash flows from operations, availability under our ATM program and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs for at least the next twelve months, and in the longer term. We depend upon the availability of capital under our Loan Agreement and Facilities Agreement to finance our operations.  Compliance with the fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA covenants contained in the Loan Agreement are closely tied to our fiscal 2017 financial plan. We also operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future sales and expenses. If we are unable to comply with the Adjusted EBITDA covenants contained in the Loan Agreement, as amended from time to time, SNB could declare the outstanding borrowings under the facility immediately due and payable. If we need to obtain additional funds as a result of the termination of the Loan Agreement or Facilities Agreement or the acceleration of amounts due thereunder, there can be no assurance that alternative financing can be obtained on substantially similar or acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to promptly obtain alternate financing could limit our ability to implement our business plan and have an immediate, severe and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In the event that no alternative financing is available, we would be forced to drastically curtail operations, or dispose of assets, or cease operations altogether.  
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from the information provided in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.  
 21 

ADJUSTED EBITDA (Loss)   
 Adjusted EBITDA (loss), a non-GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) financial measure, represents net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, the gain/loss on the change in the fair value of the related warrant liabilities, and goodwill impairment, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor is it being presented as an alternative to operating or net loss as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As defined, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. We believe, however, that in addition to the performance measures found in our financial statements, Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of operating performance in comparing our performance on a consistent basis over prior periods, as it removes from operating results the impact of our capital structure, including the interest expense resulting from our outstanding debt, and our asset base, including depreciation and amortization of our capital and intangible assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for our lender. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as follows (in thousands):  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not historical fact and constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and constitute  forward-looking information  as defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively  forward-looking statements ). These forward-looking statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, business development, market and competitive position, financial results, expected revenue, expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of our existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs. These statements relate to our expectations, hopes, beliefs, anticipations, commitments, intentions and strategies regarding the future, and may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   should,   plan,   estimate,  and  potential,  among others. Specifically this document contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the continuance of significant seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations, inventories, receivables, payables and cash; the sufficiency of funds available to meet operational needs; the ability to meet the financial covenants under our existing loan agreements; the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the possible use of financial hedging techniques; our expectations regarding sales, gross margins and operating expenses; and the potential release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.  
 The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect management s current beliefs and expectations and are based on information currently available to management, as well as its analysis made in light of its experience, perception of trends, current conditions, expected developments and other factors and assumptions believed to be reasonable and relevant in the circumstances. These assumptions include, but are not limited to: continuing demand by consumers for videogames and accessories, continued financial viability of our largest customers, continued access to capital to finance our working capital requirements and the continuance of open trade with China, where the preponderance of our products are manufactured.  
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and are subject to important factors and events that could cause our actual business, prospects and results of operations to differ materially from the historical information contained in this Form 10-Q, and from those that may be expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements for the reasons detailed in Part I   Item 1A.   Risk Factors of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Part II Other Information   Item 1A. We believe that many of the risks detailed in our other SEC filings are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate, and will likely be present in all periods reported. The fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and we assume no

obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward-looking statements, except as may be required by applicable law.   

Item 4.   
 
     Controls and Procedures     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rules 13a-15(b) we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (who is also the Chief Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report.

PART II   OTHER   INFORMATION   

Item 1.   
 
     Legal Proceedings     

 In March 2016, Performance Design Products LLC ( PDP ), filed a complaint against MCI for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The complaint is styled  Performance Design Products LLC v. Mad Catz, Inc ., Civil Action No. 16-cv-0629-GPC-RBB and it alleges that MCI has infringed and continues to infringe U.S. Patent No. D624,078 (the   078 Patent ) by making, using, offering for sale, selling, and/or importing in the United States the Street Fighter V FightPad PRO covered by one of more claims of the  078 Patent.  The complaint was formally served on MCI in March 2016.  In May 2016, MCI move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim against MCI.  In June 2016, the Court granted MCI s motion to dismiss, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and entered judgment in MCI s favor. On July 29, 2016, PDP filed its notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ( Federal Circuit ).  On October 11, 2016, the parties notified the Federal Circuit that they had reached an agreement to dismiss the appeal.  That same day, the Federal Circuit dismissed PDP s appeal.  The outcome of these proceedings did not have any material adverse effect on the Company.  
 In addition to the foregoing matter, from time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We will also, from time to time, when appropriate in management s estimation, record reserves in our financial statements for pending litigation. Litigation is expensive and is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in any such matters could adversely impact our operating results or financial condition. Additionally, any litigation to which we may become subject could also require significant involvement of our senior management and may divert management s attention from our business and operations. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of any current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days within which to object to or contest such Third Party Claim;  provided ,  however , that no action taken, or not taken, by the Indemnified Party with respect to or relating in any way to the Claim Notice, the Third Party Claim or the facts underlying such Third Party Claim prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) days period shall impact, reduce or otherwise harm such Indemnified Party s right to indemnification pursuant to this Article VI.  If the Indemnifying Party does not object to or contest such Third Party Claim within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted the Third Party Claim and deemed to agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all or any portion of the requested Losses. If the Indemnifying Party (i) provides written notice to the Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent that the Indemnifying Party agrees that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all or any portion of the requested Losses or (ii) the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have accepted a Third Party Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent, on behalf of the Sellers, and Swiss Buyer shall provide written notice to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release any relevant amount of the Escrow Funds or Tooling Escrow Funds, as applicable, to Swiss Buyer.

The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (the   Notice Period  ) to notify the Indemnified Party (with a copy of such notice to the Escrow Agent) that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim unless (i) the Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party in the Claim Notice that it has determined in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim may materially and adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages, (ii) the Third Party Claim has been brought or asserted by a Government Entity, or (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks or could, if resolved in the favor of the asserting or claiming party, reasonably be expected to result in the award or imposition of preliminary, temporary or permanent injunctive relief, specific performance, equitable relief or

Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense at its expense unless (i) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interests between them, or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of Section 6.4(c), in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party with respect to such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) any monetary Liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. 
     (c)  If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not entitled to defend the Third Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Party s election to defend the Third Party Claim as provided in Section 6.4(a), or (iii) after assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within five (5) days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense;  it   being   understood   that  the Indemnified Party s right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by the defense;  it   being   further   understood   that  that the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in such Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to defend the Third Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Party s election to defend the Third Party Claim as provided in Section 6.4(a), the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim in an amount that exceeds the Escrow Amount without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; it being understood that the failure by the Indemnifying Party to consent to any such compromise or  
 48 

settlement within thirty (30) days of notice thereof shall be unreasonable, unless such Indemnifying Party provides written reasons for such failure to consent, with sufficient detail,   within such thirty (30) day period  .  
 (d)  The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including by keeping the other party fully informed of the status of such Third Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such party is not represented by its own counsel, and by providing access to each other s relevant business records and other documents, and employees;  it   being   understood   that  the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be Losses. 
 (e)  The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each use its Best Efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. 
 (f)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Indemnifying Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect to such proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on each such Indemnifying Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim and the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim and deemed to agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all or any portion of the requested Losses. If the Indemnifying Party (i) provides written notice to the Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent that the Indemnifying Party agrees that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all or any portion of the requested Losses or (ii) the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have accepted a Direct Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent, on behalf of the Sellers, and Swiss Buyer shall provide written notice to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release any relevant amount of the Escrow Funds or Tooling Escrow Funds, as applicable, to Swiss Buyer.

A  final determination  shall exist when (a) the parties to the dispute have reached an a  greement in writing, (b) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final Order or judgment, or (c) if after the Closing the parties shall have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a fina  l determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto.

The remedies expressly provided in this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for and means of recourse between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 
     Section 6.10   Effect of Buyers  Knowledge .  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss under this Article VI   notwithstanding the fact that any Buyer, any Indemnified Party or any of their respective Affiliates had knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto, and that the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon the representations and warranties, covenants and obligations contained in the Transaction Documents shall not be affected in any way by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. 
     Section 6.11   Specific Performance .  Each Seller and each Buyer each acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy.  Each party accordingly agrees that, in addition to other rights or remedies, each party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and to obtain preliminary, temporary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or  
 51 

threatened breach of this Agreement   or the Ancillary A  greements  , without posting any bond or other undertaking.  
   Section 6.12   Subordination .   
 (a)  Each Seller and Canada Holdco agrees and acknowledges that the Intercompany Subordinated Debt is and shall be subject, subordinate and rendered junior, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations of Sellers and Canada Holdco to Buyers now existing or hereafter arising under any Transaction Document, including all Losses of any Buyer Indemnified Party, whether or not allowed as a claim in any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding, including all Losses accruing after the filing of a petition initiating any such proceeding, whether or not allowed in a claim in such proceeding (any such obligations are referred to collectively as the   Senior Indebtedness  ).  Each of the Sellers and Canada Holdco hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Section 6.12 by Buyers, and each Seller and Canada Holdco hereby waives notice of and consents to the making, amount and terms of the Senior Indebtedness which may exist or be created from time to time, subject to the other provisions of this Article VI.  The provisions of this Section 6.12 shall constitute a continuing offer made for the benefit of and to all Buyers, and each Buyer is hereby irrevocably authorized to enforce such provision. 
 (b)  In the event that any Seller or Canada Holdco shall make, and/or any Seller or Canada Holdco or any of their respective Affiliates shall receive from any source whatsoever, any payment on Intercompany Subordinated Debt in contravention of this Agreement, then and in any such event such payment shall be deemed to be the property of, segregated by, received by, and held in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of, Buyers, and shall be promptly paid over and delivered to Buyers in the form received (with any necessary indorsement) to be applied, pro rata (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in the case of noncash property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment of the Senior Indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (c)  Each Seller and Canada Holdco will be permitted to make payments on the Intercompany Subordinated Debt so long as the aggregate amount set forth in unresolved Claim Notices and Direct Claim Notices are less than the sum of the then remaining Escrow Amount and Tooling Escrow Amount (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any portion of the Escrow Amount or the Tooling Escrow Amount that is the subject of any claim that has not been resolved at such time). 
 (d)  Upon any payment or distribution of all or any of the assets of any Seller or Canada Holdco of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other property, in the event of: 
 (i)  any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to any such Seller, or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets; 
 52 

(ii)    any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of any Seller or Canada Holdco, whether voluntary or   involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy; or  
 (iii)   any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshaling of assets and liabilities of any Seller or Canada Holdco; 
 then, and in any such event, unless Buyers shall otherwise agree in writing, Buyers shall receive payment in full in cash of all amounts due or to become due (whether or not the Senior Indebtedness has been declared due and payable prior to the date on which the Senior Indebtedness would otherwise have become due and payable) on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness (including post-petition interest, costs, fees and expenses, whether or not allowed as a claim) before Sellers and Canada Holdco and their respective Affiliates or anyone claiming through or on their behalf (including any receiver, trustee, or otherwise) are entitled to receive any payment on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on or other amounts payable in respect of the Intercompany Subordinated Debt, and to that end, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Intercompany Subordinated Debt in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or similar event, shall be paid or delivered directly to Buyers for the application (in the case of cash) to, or as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment of the Senior Indebtedness until the Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash. 
 (e)  If any proceeding, liquidation, dissolution or winding up referred to in clause (d) above is commenced by or against any Seller: 
 (i)  Buyers are hereby irrevocably authorized and empowered (in their own names or in the name of any such Seller or Canada Holdco or otherwise), but shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment or distribution in respect of the Intercompany Subordinated Debt above and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs of claim and take such other action (including voting the Intercompany Subordinated Debt or enforcing any security interest or other lien securing payment of the Intercompany Subordinated Debt) as Buyers may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights or interests of Buyers hereunder; provided, that in the event Buyers take such action, Buyers shall apply all proceeds first, to the payment of the costs of enforcement of this Agreement, and second, to the pro rata payment and/or prepayment of the Senior Indebtedness; and 
 (ii)  each Seller and Canada Holdco shall duly and promptly take such action as Buyers may request (A) to collect the Intercompany Subordinated Debt for the account of Buyers and to file appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of the Intercompany Subordinated Debt, (B) to execute and deliver to Buyers such powers of attorney, assignments, or other instruments as Buyers may reasonably request in order to enable them to enforce any and all claims with respect to, and any security interests and other liens securing payment of, the Intercompany Subordinated Debt and (C) to collect and receive any and all payments or distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the Intercompany Subordinated Debt. 
 53 

(f)    This Section 6.12 is a continuing agreement of subordination and shall continue in effect and be binding upon each Seller and Canada Holdco until payment and performance in full in cash of the Senior Indebtedness. The subordination  s, agreements, and priorities set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect regardless of whether any party hereto in the future seeks to rescind, amend, terminate, or reform, by litigation or otherwise, its respective agreements with any other Se  ller until the expiration of the last of the survival periods and any related claims set forth in  Section 6.1.   
 (g)  This Section 6.12 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Senior Indebtedness is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Seller or Canada Holdco or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

Any provision of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements may be amended or waived only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Buyer and each Seller, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.  No notice or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or the right of the party giving a notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.  No waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except for the specific instance for which it is given.
