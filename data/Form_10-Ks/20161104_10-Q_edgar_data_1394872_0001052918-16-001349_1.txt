NOTE 1:  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
   
 On June 23, 2014, AWG International Water Corporation changed its corporate name to Ambient Water Corporation by amending articles of incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State.  This corporate action was recommended by the board of directors and approved by written consent of majority shareholders in lieu of a special meeting.  The Company also changed the name of its wholly owned subsidiary to Ambient Water, Inc. from AWG International, Inc.  Both name change amendments were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State's office on June 23, 2014. 
   
 Ambient Water Corporation ( AWGI  or  the Company ), designs and sells Atmospheric Water Generation products.  These products harvest water from the humidity in the atmosphere to produce pure drinkable water.  AWGI utilizes contract manufacturers to assemble its products.  The Company markets and sells its products through a network of domestic and international distributors with clearly identified geographic territories.  AWGI is one of the pioneers of atmospheric water generation technology for extracting water from humidity in the air. Drawing from the renewable ocean of water vapor in the air that we breathe, our patented technology cost effectively transforms humidity into an abundant source of clean water near the point of use. Our scalable and modular systems can be configured for a number of water-sensitive applications ranging from oil and gas exploration to drought relief to vertical farming. Our systems can also be configured to produce high quality drinking water for homes, offices, and communities. 
   
 On July 10, 2012, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) by and among AWG International Water Corporation and AWG International, Inc.  On July 10, 2012, AWG International Water Corporation acquired AWG International, Inc. (the  Business Combination ), which became a wholly owned subsidiary of AWG International Water Corporation. AWG International Water Corporation incorporated on December 19, 2005, under the laws of the State of Nevada, and is headquartered in Spokane Valley, Washington.  The Company s previous name was MIP Solutions, Inc.  MIP Solutions, Inc. was considered a shell company prior to the business combination. 
   
 The Company follows the accounting guidance outlined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification guidelines. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-K. They may not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2016.  The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three (3) months and nine (9)) months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been made.  Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context 
   
 The Company s financial statements include certain estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates. 
   
 Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.  These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported losses, total assets, or stockholders equity. 
   
    Year End and Principles of Consolidation    
   
 These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s consolidated fiscal year-end is December 31.

Ambient Water Corporation  
  Notes to Financial Statements  
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All inter-company transactions are eliminated. 
   
   Going Concern   
   
 The Company has not generated positive cash flows since inception and has recognized approximately $17 million in net operating losses, which raises substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  The Company is dependent upon achieving positive cash flow from operations and obtaining additional external financing to fund ongoing operations.   
   
 To achieve these objectives, the Company continues to seek other sources of financing to support existing operations and expand the range and scope of its business.  However, there are no assurances that such financing can be obtained on acceptable terms and in a timely manner, if at all.  The failure to obtain the necessary working capital would have a material adverse effect on the business and, in the event the Company is unable to execute its business plan, the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern.   
   
 The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustment to the recorded assets or liabilities that may be necessary should the Company have to curtail operations or be unable to continue operations. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The objective of the amendments in this Update is to provide guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if  conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-15 on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The objective of ASU 2014-19 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either a retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements nor decided upon the method of adoption. 
   
 The Company is reviewing the effects of following recent updates.  The Company has no expectation that any of these items will have a material effect upon the financial statements.

   Technology Acquisition   
   
 The technology supporting the Company s products ( Technology Acquisition ) was obtained from its founders and their related companies.  
   
 On November 19, 2010, Licensee, the patent application owner, assigned Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application number PCT/US2010/57371 to AWG International, Inc.   On May 18, 2012, AWG filed U.S. patent application number 13/510,757 claiming priority to PCT/US2010/57371.  We refer to this patent as supporting the proposed G3 product line.  In consideration of this assignment, 250,000 shares of AWG common stock were issued to Licensee.  At the time of the technology acquisition, the Company determined the value of the Technology Acquisition to be $36,216 based upon the actual, verifiable costs associated with securing the patent.   
   
 The Company s technology rights also include the assignment of patents which included U.S. Patent No. 7,272,947, U.S. Patent 7,886,557, PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US/2005/031948, and all patents and patent applications throughout the world, including any divisions, reissues or continuations. U.S. Patent 7,886,557 represents a patent derived from U.S. Patent No. 7,272,947 or an improvement to the U.S. Patent No. 7,272,947.  These patents are associated with our Model 2500 product.  
   
 Also, the Company has additional shared patent and license rights which were clarified on February 14, 2013.  On February 14, 2013, AWG International, Inc. assigned the G2 patent assets to the inventors, Rae Anderson and Keith White.   
   
 Thereafter, Keith White, as co-inventor, assigned the G2 patent assets to AWG International, Inc.  
   
 As a result of these assignments, AWG International, Inc. and Rae Anderson each own a one-half undivided interest in the G2 patent assets. 
   
 On April 19, 2012, Mr. Keith White, the patent owner, assigned Patent application number 61/489.588 titled  Atmospheric Water Generator  to AWG International, Inc.  We refer to this patent as supporting the proposed G4 and G5 product lines.  
   
 On January 12, 2016, the Australian Government, accepted Patent application Number 2010321841.  The Patent is effective from November 19, 2010 through November 19, 2030.  The cost to acquire the Patent was $8,891.  Amortization expense for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $304 and $0. The Patent will be amortized over the remaining effective life. 
   
 Additionally, for the quarter ending September 30, 2016, the Company has capitalized $4,895 of expenses in this account.  The Company will continue to capitalize expenses in this account for Patents being pursued.  At such time the patent is granted, the Company will begin to amortize over the useful life. If patents are denied, the Company will expense the costs associated with pursuing the patent. 
   
 The technology rights are being amortized over expected lives of five to twenty years. 
   
 Long-lived assets of the Company, including Technology Acquisition, are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value has become impaired, pursuant to guidance established in FASB ASC 410-20.

Derivative liability   
   
 Under FASB ASC 815-40  Contracts in Entity s Own Equity,  the Company must review the possible conversion features under the agreement s variable price conversion options, which create a derivative in the possible settlement choices of the Lender.   As of September 30, 2016, the stock pricing feature for Note A above which provides a 50% discount to the market would have increased the stock necessary to settle the conversion if requested to approximately 10,609,149,000 shares.  The Company has calculated the value of this additional liability to be $4,593,762 and has recognized a change of earnings for the effect of such a conversion through September 30, 2016.  Additionally, the conversion features on Note G above would have increased the stock necessary to settle the conversion feature on this Note to approximately 1,555,100,000 shares.  The Company has calculated the value of this additional liability to be $673,360 and has recognized a change of earnings for the effect of such a conversion through September 30, 2016.  Total derivative liability was $5,267,122 and $825,712, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, the derivative liability is classified as $673,360 under current liabilities and $4,593,762 under long-term liabilities.  As of December 31, 2015, the derivative liability is classified as $76,955 under current liabilities and $748,757 under long-term liabilities.  
   
 Under FASB ASC 505-10  Equity : Overall, the Company must disclose that the settlement alternatives are at the control of the Lender and that there is a potential for an infinite number of shares having to be issued, although the Lender has elected to limit its beneficial ownership to less than five percent unless the Company receives proper notification that the Lender will at any time convert either part or all of the loan to shares.  The Lender must give the Company 60 days notice to waive the beneficial ownership limit of less than five percent, which the Company has not received as of this filing.  The amount of shares necessary to settle the conversion features of these Notes is subject to change with the trading price of our common stock and by the lowest price of common stock issued to other parties which is currently $0.00017.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Company secured the exclusive rights to the coating technology for atmospheric water generation applications.  The term of the agreement is three years and, unless terminated, shall automatically renew for an additional three years on each three year anniversary.  The agreement called for the payment of a license and exclusivity fee of $10,000 in two payments of $5,000 each.  The first payment has been paid.  Effective September 30, 2012, the parties entered into an amendment to the original agreement in which both parties acknowledged there had been no breaches of the original agreement, the remaining $5,000 payment was due on or before June 1, 2013, and all previous and/or future minimum purchase requirements were waived.  The Company has accrued the $5,000 in Accrued Liabilities for this obligation.  See discussion Note 5   Accrued Liabilities.

   NOTE 11:  Income Taxes   
   
 The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and the state of Washington.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Ambient Water Corporation had gross deferred tax assets calculated at the Federal Income Tax rate of 34% of approximately $3,955,000 and $3,295,000, respectively, principally arising from net operating loss carry-forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $11,630,000, which begin to expire in the year 2032.  As management of the Company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance of approximately $3,955,000 and $3,295,000 has been established at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   
 The significant components of the Company s net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Due to the reverse acquisition, the Company is restricted in the future use of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards generated by Ambient Water Corporation before the effective date of the Business Combination. Both of the Companies  separate loss years  net operating losses will be subject to possible limitations concerning changes of control and other limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to annual limitations which are cumulative until they expire.  The Company is in the process of determining the annual allowable net operating loss deduction should the Company generate taxable income.  Since both of the companies which were parties to the share exchange have substantial valuation allowances against any components of deferred taxes, management believes that no material differences in tax allocations will arise from the share transaction.  
   
 The accounting for the tax benefits of acquired deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry-forwards, which are not recognized at the acquisition date because a valuation allowance is established and which are recognized subsequent to the acquisition, will be applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition. Any remaining benefits would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in future periods. 
   
 FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.

Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25  Income Taxes   Recognition.   Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end.  A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the  more likely than not  standard imposed by FASB ASC 740-10-25-5. 
   
 The Company s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had a $40,000 accrual for penalties on its balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and has recognized this as interest and/or penalties in the statement of operations for the years ending December 31, 2014.  Further, the Company currently has no open tax years, subject to audit prior to December 31, 2012.  The Company is current on its federal returns and State of Idaho income tax return requirements. 
   
   NOTE 12:  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Due to our falling share price, we presently have insufficient authorized common stock capital to meet the  Reservation of Shares  requirements under both notes.   Prior to December 15, 2016, the company intends to address the issue. 
   
 On November 1, 2016, the Company issued 58,889,498 common shares for a partial note payable and accrued interest conversion at $0.00015 per share.

  Company s Plans    
   
 We began selling the Model 2500 Atmospheric Water Generator in August 2012 to our Philippine distributor.  In 2013, we initiated product sales to our primary U.S. distributor.  In 2014 we began marketing the Ambient Water 400 as it approached field trial testing. Our Philippine distributor ceased business operations at the end of 2014. We continue to service the Philippine market through a service contractor and are actively seeking new distribution partners for the territory.  We have added several distributors and are working with our agents and other potential distributors in many geographical areas including Latin America, Mexico the Caribbean, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Middle East. In early 2015 we began to focus more of our R D efforts on the commercial/industrial bulk water sector. The result has been an entirely new design that is focused solely on bulk water production in comparison to the AW 400 which provides water and Air Conditioning at the same time.  We intend to follow with the introduction of two commercial/industrial products, the Ambient Water 800 and the Ambient Water 20K. The introduction of these new container configurations allows quick turnaround at the manufacturing level, ease of shipping, increased water production and streamlined deployment in the field. We are working closely with our partner ACT in Houston Texas to complete the all new AW 800. The pre-production unit is currently in the testing phase. In early 2016 we began to offer the AW 800 and the AW 20K to new and existing customers. We have been working closely with Governments and Corporations and the units have been well received. Unfortunately the sales cycle is significantly longer than we have anticipated and coupled with the rise in the US dollar has delayed the completion of anticipated orders.  In addition to the AW 800 and the AW 20K, we have begun preliminary designs for larger systems supplying up to several millions of gallons per day. Our goal is to generate positive cash flow from product sales to fund operations at the earliest opportunity. 
   
 The Ambient Water 400 was placed into field trial testing in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Testing in Houston, Texas was successful and additional data points were desired to augment the test data gathered.  The unit was moved to Sacramento, California where additional testing began but was terminated by Pacific Air Well, our California distribution partner who was conducting the testing.  Currently, the Ambient Water 400 is located at the University of California, San Diego being prepared for additional testing.  Generator power was used briefly for a demonstration, a suitable location with grid power is being reviewed. 
   
 We are actively working to develop a global distributor network, focusing on highly qualified companies with a history of business in the drinking water industry. We are pursuing additional potential distributors and have several active agents helping to identify new distributors and customers.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
  Revenues  
   
 Revenue from sales to date has been modest.  For the next few quarters we are projecting modest sales as we build our distribution network.    For the quarter ending September 30, 2015, we had $80,127 revenue compared to $20,121 revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2016. The revenue decrease was due to decreased demand for the Model 2500.   
   
  Costs and Expenses  
 Our primary costs going forward are related to ongoing sales and marketing, professional fees, executive compensation, administrative payroll and legal fees associated with patent maintenance.  
 For the quarter ending September 30, 2015, we had $374,608 in general and administrative expenses compared with $138,039 for the quarter ending September 30, 2016.  This decrease of $236,569 in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of professional fees decreasing in the amount of $28,726 stock option compensation (non-cash) decreasing $146,693, travel fees decreasing in the amount of $12,894 and other general and administrative operating costs decreasing by $20,756.   
 Professional fees for the quarters ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were $60,354 and $31,628, respectively.  The $28,726 decrease was due to legal and Intellectual property expenses decreasing by $4,814, accounting and auditing fees increasing by $3,333, legal fees decreasing by $15,374, Public and filing fees decreasing by $7,157 and other professional fees decreasing by $4,714.   
 Executive compensation for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 was $87,500 and $60,000, respectively.  The $27,500 decrease was due to a Board of Directors decision to lower executive pay for 2016.   
   
 The legal and intellectual property expenses for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were $4,814 and $-0-, respectively.    The $4,814 decrease for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 was primarily related to capitalizing intellectual property costs rather than expensing these costs awaiting patents being granted or denied in the current quarter ended September 30, 20165.   
   
 The stock option compensation (non-cash) expenses for the quarters ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were $157,006 and $10,313, respectively.  The $146,693 decrease was related to a decrease in stock compensation because certain stock options were completely amortized after the second quarter of 2016. 
   
 The Company s travel expenses for the quarters ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were $13,415 and $521, respectively.  The $12,894 decrease was primarily related to less travel in the quarter ending September 30, 2016.  
   
 The other general and administrative operating costs for the quarters ending September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were $56,333 and $35,577, respectively.  The $20,756 decrease was related to a decrease in payroll taxes of $2,295, a decrease in advertising of $7,605, a decrease in research and development of $7,377 and other decreases of $3,479.  
   
 During the quarter ending September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a derivative valuation charge of $170,840 related to the conversion value of new debt acquired during the quarter.  Additionally, the Company recognized a derivative valuation gain of $2,770,875 related to the conversion value of the debt entered into through June 2016. (See Note 6 in the financial statements).     
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $300 cash, total current assets of $82,723, total current liabilities of $1,229,947 and total stockholders' deficit of $6,405,028, compared to $820 cash, total current assets of $83,699, total current liabilities of $730,714, and total stockholders' deficit of $2,214,435 as of December 31, 2015. 
 The Company experienced negative cash flow used by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $407,074 compared to the negative cash flow used by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $123,834.  The Company experienced negative cash flows of $2,570 from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to negative cash flows from investing activity of $13,786 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities of $359,762 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to positive cash flows from financing activity of $137,100 for the nine  

23 

months ended September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $137,100 through draws on two separate convertible notes payable described in Note 6-- Convertible Notes Payable-- in the Company s financial statements.  
   
 The Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained a  going concern  qualification.  As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to financial statements, the Company has incurred losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate cash flows from operations to satisfy its liabilities and sustain operations.  Because of these conditions, our independent auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company funded its operations principally through issuance of debt instruments.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company funded its operations principally through issuance of debt instruments. 
 Our financial objective is to make sure the Company has the cash and debt capacity to fund on-going operating activities, investments and growth.  We intend to fund future capital needs through our current cash position, future operating cash flow and debt or equity financing.  There is no assurance that equity or debt capital will be available as necessary to meet the Company's requirements or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had 1,340,000 outstanding warrants with an exercise price of $0.03.  If the 1,340,000 vested warrants were exercised, $40,200 would be paid to support ongoing capital needs. The Company cannot be assured that the warrant holder will exercise any warrants.  There are no warrants subject to the Company s call.  
 Existing capital resources are insufficient to support continuing operations of the Company over the next 12 months.  Therefore, the Company will need to obtain additional financing to support existing, as well as, continuing operations.  We anticipate that the Company will need approximately $1,000,000 of additional capital over the next 12 months to execute Management s plan of operations, including the purchase of inventory, general and administrative expenses and expenditures required for the delivery of the Model 2500 and introduction of additional product models in 2016. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised no money through the sale of equity. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised $25,000 through debt financing. 
 Additionally, in March 2014, the Company entered into a financing transaction with an accredited investor, ( Lender ).  The transaction created a direct company financial obligation in the form of a convertible promissory note for $900,000, ( Loan ).   Through September 30, 2016, the Company owed $585,100 Dollars principal plus $125,713 accrued interest on the Note. The Lender has the right to convert all or part of the Loan amount into common shares. (See Note 6 in the financial statements).   
   
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company entered into a financing transaction with an accredited investor, ( Lender ).  The transaction created a direct company financial obligation in the form of a convertible promissory note for $250,000, ( Loan ).  Through September 30, 2016, the Company owed $100,000 principal plus $4,192 accrued interest on the Note.  The Lender has the right to convert all or part of the Loan amount into common shares. (See Note 6 in the financial statements). 
 While no assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future results as actual results may differ materially, management anticipates adequate capital resources to support continuing operations over the next 12 months through the combination of the Loan, the sale of equity, forecasted working capital from operations, and existing cash reserves.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
 The Company recognizes revenues when earned which shall be as products are shipped and services are delivered to customers or distributors.  The Company shall also record accounts receivable for revenue earned but not yet collected. 

24 

Income Taxes  
 Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to FASB ASC 740-10-25   Income Taxes   Recognition  .  Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end.  A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the  more likely than not  standard imposed by FASB ASC 740-10-25-5. 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately ($11,630,000), which will begin to expire in 2032 and are calculated at an expected tax rate of approximately 34%.  
 FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  At September 30, 2016, the Company has not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740. 
 Pursuant to FASB ASC 740, income taxes are provided for based upon the liability method of accounting.  Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end.  A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the  more likely than not  standard imposed by FASB ASC 740 to allow recognition of such assets.  
  Earnings (Loss) Per Share  ( EPS ) 
 FASB ASC 260, Earnings per Share provides for calculation of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity similar to fully diluted earnings per share.  Basic and diluted losses per share were the same, at the reporting dates, as there were no common stock equivalents outstanding. 
   
  Derivative Instruments     
   
 FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  They require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. 
   
 If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.  For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change. 
   
 During 2015, 2016 and the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company had engaged in transactions that would be considered derivative instruments or hedging activities. 
   
 The Company entered into a series of Convertible Promissory Notes which included conversion clauses which are deemed derivative liabilities.  As of December 31, 2015 the estimated effect upon the fair market conversion of the outstanding note balances of $910,983 and accrued interest payable of $110,428 was approximately $825,712 for the relative fair market conversion of the note to common stock.   
   
 As of September 30, 2016 the estimated effect upon the fair market conversion of the outstanding note balances of $685,100 and accrued interest payable of $129,904 was approximately $5,267,122 for the relative fair market conversion of the note to common stock.  For further information see Note 6 to the financial statement. 

25 

In March 2014, the Company entered in a financing transaction with an accredited investor which includes certain variable conversion rights attached to the convertible note debt structure.  In accordance with FASB ASC 815-40  Contracts in Entity s Own Equity,  the Company will need to review the possible conversion features under the agreement and disclose any additional derivative liability and the effect of changes in the derivative liability with the issuance of its financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, the value of the stock necessary to settle the contract was $4,593,762. 
   
 In February 2016, the Company entered in a financing transaction with an accredited investor which includes certain variable conversion rights attached to the convertible note debt structure.  In accordance with FASB ASC 815-40  Contracts in Entity s Own Equity,  the Company will need to review the possible conversion features under the agreement and disclose any additional derivative liability and the effect of changes in the derivative liability with the issuance of its financial statements. As of September 30, 2016, the value of the stock necessary to settle the contract was $673,360. 
   
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
   
 Long-lived assets of the Company, including the Technology Rights, are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value has become impaired, pursuant to guidance established in the FASB ASC 350-30 .   Management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations (undiscounted and without interest charges).  If impairment is deemed to exist, the asset will be written down to fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or internal and external appraisals, as applicable.  Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value.  Management has determined that there was no impairment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The Company's financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 825-10-50 include cash, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses.  All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Inflation  
   
 It is our opinion that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations.

           ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 In connection with the preparation of this report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information was not accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
