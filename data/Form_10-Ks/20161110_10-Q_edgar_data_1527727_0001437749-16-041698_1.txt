NOTE 1         GENERAL   
       
   Business   
       
  Iron Sands Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 18, 2011 with the objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. The Company s principal business objective in the near term will be to achieve long-term growth potential through capital formation or a combination with an operating business rather than seeking short-term earnings.   
     
  On August 26, 2015, the Company was acquired by Badlands NGLs, LLC ( Badlands  or the  Parent ), a company that is engaged in the development of a polymer manufacturing plant in the U.S.  
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for reporting on Form 10-Q. The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ), but does not contain all information required for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements and these notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  
     
  Except as the context otherwise requires, the terms  Iron Sands,   we,   our  or  us  means Iron Sands Corp.  
     
   Going Concern   
     
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate the Company s continuation as a going concern, whereby the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are in the ordinary course of business. However, the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm on the Company s financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The  going concern  qualification resulted from, among other things, the Company s net losses since inception and negative working capital and stockholders  deficit as of December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $233,166, cash of $1,774 and stockholders  deficit of $56,554. The Company requires cash from the Parent to fund its ongoing operating expenses and does not anticipate generating any revenue in the near term. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be different should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
   Recently Issued Accounting   Pronouncements      
     
  The Company has considered all recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of this report and does not believe they   will have a material impact on its future financial statements.

NOTE   2           OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
       
  The Company s current CEO and sole director is Vice Chairman and a Member of the Board of Managers of Badlands.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Parent advanced cash to the Company of $6,675 and $32,349, respectively. The Company made no repayments to the Parent for any of advances made during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016, and all advances are payable upon demand by the Parent.  
     
  Currently, the Company is headquartered at the corporate office of the Parent and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was utilizing office space, office equipment and certain professional services of the Parent at no cost.  

NOTE   3           LOSS PER SHARE   
     
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented. Diluted net loss per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic net loss per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding for any of the periods presented. Accordingly, basic shares equal diluted shares for all periods presented.

   Forward Looking Statements    
     
  The information in this report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements in this report or incorporated herein by reference constitute our expectations or forecasts of future events as of the date this report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are not statements of historical fact. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such statements may include words such as  anticipate,   will,   estimate,   seek,   expect,   project,   intend,   should,   plan,   believe,   hope,  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of, among other things, future operating or financial performance, strategic initiatives and business strategies, regulatory or competitive environments, our intellectual property and product development. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and to note they speak only as of the date hereof. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking statements due to new information or other events.   
     
   Description of Business    
     
  We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 18, 2011 with the objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating company. We filed a General Form for Registration of Securities on Form 10 ( Registration Statement ) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on August 12, 2011, and we elected at that time to have March 31 as our fiscal year end. Effective December 31, 2015, we elected to change our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31.  
     
  We currently conduct no business and are considered to be a "blank check" company. The SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a  shell company,  because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. At this time management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a financial transaction with an operating company or raise sufficient capital to commence a business operation. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act while we are subject to those requirements.  
     
  Effective August 26, 2015, and for cash consideration of $49,319, we sold 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, to Badlands NGLs, LLC ( Badlands  or the  Parent ), a privately-held company engaged in the development of a polymer manufacturing plant in the U.S.  
     
   Results of Operations     For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 ( September 2016 Quarter ) Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 ( September 2015 Quarter )   
     
  Since inception, we have had no operations and have generated no revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, our operating losses were primarily comprised of general and administrative expenses for legal, accounting, audit and other professional fees associated with our Exchange Act filings. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $8,075 and $17,499, respectively, and interest expense was $-0- and $701, respectively. For the September 2016 Quarter, we recognized a net loss of $8,075 compared to a net loss of $18,200 for the September 2015 Quarter. This decrease in our net loss was primarily due to lower outside accounting and legal fees incurred in the September 2016 Quarter as compared to the September 2015 Quarter associated with the preparation of our Exchange Act filings and no interest expense (as a result of no interest bearing debt outstanding) during the September 2016 Quarter compared to the September 2015 Quarter.

Results of Operations     For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 ( September 2016 Period ) Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 ( September 2015 Period )   
       
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, our operating losses were primarily comprised of general and administrative expenses for legal, accounting, audit and other professional fees associated with our Exchange Act filings. For the September 2016 Period and the September 2015 Period, general and administrative expenses were $32,113 and $36,090, respectively, and interest expense was $-0- and $2,836, respectively. For the September 2016 Period, we recognized a net loss of $32,113 compared to a net loss of $38,926 for the September 2015 Period. This decrease in our net loss was primarily due to lower accounting and legal fees associated with the preparation of our Exchange Act filings during the September 2016 Period as compared to the September 2015 Period, offset by higher auditing fees incurred during the September 2016 Period as compared to the September 2015 Period associated with the change in our fiscal year end from March 31 to December.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources      
     
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern, whereby the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are in the ordinary course of business. However, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The  going concern  qualification resulted from, among other things, our net losses since inception and negative working capital and stockholders  deficit as of December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $233,166, cash of $1,774 and stockholders  deficit of $56,554. We require cash from our Parent to fund our ongoing operating expenses and do not anticipate generating any revenue in the near term. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be different should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
   Financing   
     
  Since August 27, 2015, our Parent has provided funding to us in the form of cash advances. The advances are due upon demand and carry no expiration date.   
     
   Cash    
     
  Our available cash at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 was $1,774, $3,038 and $520, respectively.  
     
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities      
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operations was $33,613. The primary use of cash from operations were general and administrative expenses, which totaled $32,113.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $39,979. The primary use of cash from operations were general and administrative expenses, which totaled $36,090.  

8

Cash Flows from Investing Activities      
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we did not generate or expend cash from investing activities.  
     
   Cash Flows from Financing Activities    
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated $32,349 of cash from financing activities from advances made to us by our Parent.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated $37,161 of cash from financing activities from a loan made to us by a related party.  
     
   Anticipated Cash Commitments   
     
  In the near term, we expect our cash requirements to be for funding general and administrative expenses associated with legal, accounting, audit and filing fees for our required Exchange Act filings. We believe that our Parent will provide cash to fund these expenses in the near term, although there can be no assurance that funding will be available from our Parent to continue to fund our operating expenses. If funding ceased to be available from our Parent, it is likely that we would have to cease our Exchange Act filings and cease to operate as a going concern.   
       
   Critical Accounting Policies   
       
  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements contained in our 2015 Form 10-K.   

Item   3  .   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
       
  We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.  

Item   4  . Controls and   P  rocedures   
     
   Evaluation of   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our sole member of management, serving as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.   
     
   Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
     
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
