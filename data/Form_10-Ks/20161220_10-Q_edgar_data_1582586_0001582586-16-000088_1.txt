  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (UNAUDITED)  

  AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2016   

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

China Soar Information Technology, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ( the Company ) formerly known as Go Public II, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on July 22, 2013. On May 26, 2015, our former director, Thomas DeNunzio resigned and Mu Chun Lin was appointed
as our  president, CEO, CFO and sole director. We changed our name from Go Public
II, Inc. to China Soar Information Technology with the Delaware Secretary of State on June 16, 2015. 

We
currently own a piece of intellectual property to utilize, market, further develop and sell in North America, South America and
Europe a software application called ( MIMA ) to entrepreneurs and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily
create a WEB/WAP e-commerce website or cell phone client and enterprise mobile management information system by themselves. Merchants
will not have to rent network hardware operation system, entrust software development and recruit professional management. Instead,
we can offer the required network infrastructure, software and hardware platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee. MIMA
was created, owned and developed by our director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of ten years. 

NOTE
2   basis of presentation      

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below, these adjustments
consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) have been omitted. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s
financial statements and related notes as filed with the Company s Form 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on November 16, 2016. Interim results of operations for the three months ended October
31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN  

 The accompanying financial
statements are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no current revenue sources. This condition
raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s management plans
to engage in very limited activities without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding
is secured. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company
is unable to obtain revenue - producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to
cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities
through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.  

 The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 4 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Equity - Additional paid in capital  

During the  three months ended October 31, 2016, Mu
Chun Lin contributed cash of $11,900 into additional paid-in capital to fund the Company s operating expenses.

ITEM 2   
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report of China Soar
Information Technology, Inc. on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, particularly those identified with the words,  anticipates, 
 believes,   expects,   plans,   intends,   objectives,  and similar
expressions. These statements reflect management's best judgment based on factors known at the time of such statements. The reader
may find discussions containing such forward-looking statements in the material set forth under  Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  generally, and specifically therein under the captions  Liquidity
and Capital Resources  as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual events or results may differ materially
from those discussed herein. The forward-looking statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management
on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however,
are impossible to predict and no representation, guarantee, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements. 

The assumptions used for purposes of
the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty
as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation
of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require
the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated
or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. No assurance
can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements specified in the following information are
accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared. Due
to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be
reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies
and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements. 

While we believe that the historical experience, current
trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results
could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. 

For a full description of our critical
accounting policies, please refer to Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations   in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
