1 - Organization and Nature of Business   

Gopher
Protocol Inc. (the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our ,  Gopher ,  Gopher
Protocol  or  GOPH ) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada and is headquartered
in Santa Monica, California. In the past, Gopher was principally engaged in offering consulting for foreign currency market trading
to non-US resident clients, professionals and retail clients. Presently, Gopher is a development stage company that is creating
innovative mobile microchip (ICs) and software technologies based on GopherInsight   . For the six months ended June
30, 2016, the Company generated only $75,000 from the provision of services to Guardian Patch LLC, a related party (the  LLC ).  

GopherInsight  
 is a patented real time, heuristic (self-learning/artificial intelligence) based mobile technology. GopherInsight  
 chip technology, if successfully fully developed, will be able to be installed in mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops,
etc.) as well as stand-alone products. It is intended that GopherInsight    software applications will work in conjunction
with GopherInsight    microchips across mobile operating systems, providing computing power, advanced database management/sharing
functionalities and more. The technology under development consists of a smart microchip, mobile application software and supporting
software. The system contemplates the creation of a global network. Upon development, the Company believes that its microchip
technologies may be installed within mobile devices or on SIM cards.  

Recent
Developments   

Starting
on July 26, 2016, the Company relocated its headquarters to 2500 Broadway, Suite F-125, Santa Monica, California. The Company
pays roughly $5,000 per month in rent for this office space and paid a $7,500 security deposit that is classified in our financial
statements contained herein as a prepaid expense. The lease is being paid for by the LLC through reimbursement.  

On
July 29, 2016,   the  staff
of the Atlanta Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC  and the  Commission )
advised the Company in a telephone conversation, followed by a written  Wells  notice, that it is has made a preliminary
determination to recommend that the Commission file an enforcement action against the Company alleging violations of Section 13(a)
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. A Wells Notice is neither a formal
allegation of wrongdoing nor a finding that any violations of law have occurred. Rather, it provides the Company with an opportunity
to respond to issues raised by the Commission and offer its perspective prior to any SEC decision to institute proceedings. These
proceedings could result in the Company being subject to an injunction and cease and desist order from further violations of the
securities laws as well as monetary penalties of disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty.   

Though
the Company is not certain, it believes the Wells notice was issued as a result of the Company's failure to disclose within four
business (4) days on Form 8-K a material event regarding an unregistered sale of the Company's securities (the  Material
Event ). The Company subsequently reported the Material Event in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and has filed an amended and restated 10-Q for second quarter of 2014 with the SEC.  

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Presentation
and Basis of Financial Statements   

The
accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial
statements include depreciable lives of property and equipment, valuation of beneficial conversion feature debt discounts, valuation
of derivatives, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.    

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and the related depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Renewals and betterments
are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.  

As
required by U.S. GAAP for long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the fair value of its property and equipment on an annual basis
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Any impairment of value
is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. There were no impairment losses for the period ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company has opted to expense all development costs associated with the development of its intellectual
property.  

Fair
value measurements   

Financial
instruments and certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value as determined based on the assets
highest and best use. GAAP has established a framework for measuring fair value that is based on a hierarchy that requires that
the valuation technique used be based on the most objective inputs available for measuring a particular asset or liability. There
are three broad levels in the fair value hierarchy that describe the degree of objectivity of the inputs used to determine fair
value. The fair value hierarchy is set forth below:  

Level
1   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

Level
2   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument.  

Level
3   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. They are based on
best information available in the absence of level 1 and 2 inputs.  

The
carrying value of financial instruments, which include cash, notes receivable, notes payable, and accrued expenses, approximate
their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  

Treasury
Stock   

Treasury stock
is recorded at cost. The re-issuance of treasury shares is accounted for on a first in, first-out basis and any difference between
the cost of treasury shares and the re-issuance proceeds are charged or credited to additional paid-in capital. During 2011, the
Company bought back 8 post-split shares (38,000 pre-split) shares of its own shares.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ) Income Taxes. Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established,
when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of tax benefits expected to be realized.  

U.S.
GAAP requires that, in applying the liability method, the financial statement effects of an uncertain tax position be recognized
based on the outcome that is more likely than not to occur. Under this criterion the most likely resolution of an uncertain tax
position should be analyzed based on technical merits and on the outcome that would likely be sustained under examination. The
Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016. The Company s 2015 tax returns been filed.  

The
Company s federal income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the IRS for the years prior to 2010, and the
related state income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by state authorities for the years prior to 2010.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognized revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB Codification Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC
Topic 605 ). Under ASC Topic 605, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We had
revenue of $45,000 and $22,500 for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 100% of the Company s revenue was related to IT service provided to the LLC for Dr.
Rittman services, in connection with the development of the Company's Guardian Patch technology.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments   

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company
uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible
debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments
as derivative financial instruments.  

Once
determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair
value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.   

(Loss)
Per Share   

In accordance
with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share,  Basic earnings per share ( EPS )
is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants, using the treasury stock method (by
using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock
options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes
all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. Because of the Company s net losses,
the effects of stock options, convertible notes, and convertible preferred stock would be anti-dilutive and accordingly, is excluded
from the computation of earnings per share.  

Note
3 - Liquidity and Going Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis that
it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of additional income and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company sustained net losses of $1,300,340 in the first nine months of the year, and our operating activities
provided $25,882 in the first nine months of the year. Our net loss was caused in part by a non-cash warrant expense of $37,480,
which has been revalued at September 30, 2016, and prepaid legal services valued at $675,946. The Company had a working capital
deficit of $493,638, stockholders  deficit of $531,446, and accumulated deficit of $3,808,486 at September 30, 2016. This
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is dependent upon its ability to generate
revenues and its ability to continue receiving investment capital and loans from third parties to sustain its current level of
operations. The Company is in the process of securing working capital from investors for common stock, convertible notes payable,
and/or strategic partnerships. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Per the Joint Venture
agreement, the LLC has committed to provide the Company with all its working capital needs, the LLC s commitment has decreased
much of the risk of going concern.  

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue to function as a going concern, and do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Based on the Company s operating plan, existing working
capital at September 30, 2016 was insufficient to meet cash requirements to support Company operations through December 31, 2016.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
4 - Prepaid Expenses   

On
August 26, 2015, the Company finalized a consulting agreement that it entered into on August 11, 2015 with Michael Korsunsky ( Consultant )
pursuant to which Consultant was engaged by the Company to (i) provide introductions to strategic business alliances, (ii) advise
on exposure and risk in the operation of smart phone applications and (iii) advise on market fluctuations within the different
categories of the smart phone application delivery services sector, in consideration of 100,000 restricted shares of common stock
of the Company, which shares were issued on or around August 26, 2015. The fair value of the services is $26,000, which was booked
as a prepaid expense. Shares were issued for the services, though the service has not yet been provided. The Company requested
Consultant to surrender the shares into treasury for lack of performance under, and breach of, its agreement with the Company.
Failure of Consultant to comply will force the Company to file a complaint.  

In
September 2015, the Company recognized a prepaid expense for filing fees of $10,498. These prepaid fees are being amortized at
$1,750 per quarter, and that expense has been recognized in this fiscal quarter.  

Prepaid expenses
at September 30, 2016 is $32,998 and $25,998 at December 31, 2015.  

Note 5
- Property and Equipment, Net   

Property and
equipment consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation
expense was $337 for both fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Deprecation expense for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $1,010, compared to $1,010 for the period ended September 30, 2015.  

Note
6 - Other Assets   

Exclusive
License agreements   

The
Company is the exclusive license holder for certain intellectual property relating to the GopherInsight technology. The Company
has assigned all its rights as they relate to the Guardian Patch technology (the  Patch ) to the LLC as consideration
for the JV. Dr. Rittman's partners have commenced development of the product via a private LLC that has been incorporated under
the name  Guardian Patch LLC  (the  LLC ). Certain private investors will provide all initial funding to
the Company through the LLC for product development. The LLC will fund the development, and the Company will provide IT services
through Dr. Rittman for a monthly fee. Dr. Rittman has signed an amendment employment agreement with the Company. As the Company
is not a member of the LLC, the Company and the LLC have formed a Joint Venture ( JV ) for the purposes of developing
and marketing the Patch. The LLC will be responsible for funding the development of the Patch. The Company will not need be required
to invest funds in said JV. The Company responsibilities will be limited to the marketing of the product, where the marketing
budget will be funded by the LLC. Moreover, the LLC has committed to provide the Company with working capital as needed. The Company
has assigned and pledged to the LLC all its license derivative rights as they pertain to the Patch only. Dr. Rittman may be offered
membership rights at some point in the future with the LLC, with which the Company is a JV partner, but is not equity member.
The Company has agreed with the LLC that the same JV principles of the Company and the LLC for the Patch will apply for the other
two products (Epsilon and Puzpix) which will be vested under designated LLCs that will be incorporated by the LLC members.  

Development
has commenced and the Company through the JV has completed the Statement of Work (SOW) for the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC )
survey to deploy the Company's Guardian Global Tracking Device within the continental U.S. and the Company has also completed
their transmitters/transceivers modules feasibility research. Due to the fact that the Guardian tracking system uses in part a
synthetic radio frequency transmission for data, it is required to comply with various FCC regulations relevant to the system,
which the Company is complying with.  The FCC regulates the limits of potentially harmful interference to licensed transmitters
due to low power unlicensed transmitters. The Patch system consists of advanced security protocols in order to maintain
the global, private, fully-secured network. In addition, the Patch device needs to perform communication tasks across the globe
providing breakthrough tracking features.  Utilizing its robust intellectual property portfolio and experienced personnel,
the Company and its technology licensing partner, the LLC (collectively,  GPLLC ), successfully completed thorough research
which involved security, performance and FCC regulations compliance. Based on this research a set of particular frequencies
were chosen to be used by the GPLLC. By the end of this quarter, the Company completed the design and construction of the
Patch circuit prototype device. The Company has completed the construction of prototype units and is now proceeding with
an intensive testing program as well as creating a 50  commercial prototypes  to be tested as a complete system, prior
to potential launching the Sphere product into the markets.  

The
balance of other assets is $7,500 for September 30, 2016 and $12,250 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. On or around
July 28, 2016, the Company paid a security deposit of $7,500 for its office space.  

Note
7   Convertible Notes Payable   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has one convertible note outstanding with a third party ( Note I ). The current
note balance at September 30, 2016 is $46,344, which includes $9,660 of accrued interest. At December 31, 2015, the Company had
only this note outstanding as well. The balance at that time was $38,924, which included accrued interest of $6,851.  

On
January 22, 2015, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with the original holder of Note I pursuant to which Note I exchanged
$75,273 in debt into a 10% Convertible Debenture in the principal amount of $75,273 (the  Note ). The Note I Note
matures January 21, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ) and interest associated with the Note I Note is 10% per annum, which
is payable on the Maturity Date. The Note I Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at the option of Note
I, at a fixed conversion price of $0.00752734.  

Note
I has agreed to restrict its ability to convert the Note I Note and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares
of common stock held by it in the aggregate and its affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 4.99% of the
then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Note I Note was issued to Note I in reliance upon exemptions from registration
pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the Securities Act of 1933. Note I is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, on March 2, 2015, the Company and Note I amended that certain 10%
Convertible Debenture (the  Note I Debenture ) which debt underlying the Note I Debenture was initially incurred on
October 6, 2009 and exchanged for the Note I Debenture on January 19, 2014. The parties agreed that the conversion price in the
Note I Debenture would not be impacted by the 1:1,000 stock split implemented by the Company on February 24, 2015 and will remain
$0.0075273. Beneficial Conversion Feature ( BCF ) in the amount of $75,273 has not yet been fully amortized from the
note balance. As of September 30, 2016, $8,698 remains to be amortized.

The LLC will fund the development, and the Company will provide IT services via Dr. Rittman for a monthly fee. Dr. Rittman has
signed an amendment employment agreement with the Company. As the Company is not a member of the LLC, the Company and the LLC
have formed a Joint Venture ( JV ) for the purposes of developing and marketing the Patch. The LLC will be responsible
for funding the development of the Patch. The Company will not need be required to invest funds in said JV. The Company responsibilities
will be limited to the marketing of the product, where the marketing budget will be funded by the LLC. Moreover, the LLC has committed

of the GPLLC for the patch will apply for the other two products (Epsilon and Puzpix) which will be vested under designated LLCs
that will be incorporated by the LLC members. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 100% of the Company s revenue

Proceedings

trademark in lieu of potential confusion with their trademark Intel Inside. The Company has taken the initial steps necessary
to alleviate any concern Intel may have associated with mobile or computer platforms. Furthermore, the Company holds the opinion
that GopherInside is by merit different from  Intel + Inside  as two separate words. Additionally, a simple online
search yields 1,189 live non-Intel marks that include the word  INSIDE.   The Company learned that Intel
filed on February 2, 2016 said Notice of Opposition to the trademark application. The Company decided not to object and agreed
to abandon this trademark.

for a period of five (5) years. 50,000 of the Shares were issued to Waterford upon the execution of the Agreement, worth $12,999,
which such initial shares cover Q2 2016, and the Company will issue 12,500 Shares to Waterford on a quarterly basis thereafter.
The Warrant vests on a quarterly basis in eight (8) equal quarterly installments each in the amount of 93,750 shares each quarter
during the term of the Agreement. The first quarterly installment vested upon the execution of the Agreement and covers Q2 2016
and each subsequent quarterly installment vests each quarter thereafter. The warrant has been recorded as adjusting equity during
this quarter. The Company believes that this agreement is in default, as the counterparty failed to perform. As such, in the third
fiscal quarter, the Company did not issue the 12,500 shares or the portion of the Warrant due this fiscal quarter on 93,750 shares,
and does not intend to issue those items until Waterford performs under the agreement. The Company has recorded a warrant expense
of $37,480 in the current quarter.

On
July 29, 2016,   the  staff
of the Atlanta Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC  and the  Commission )
advised the Company in a telephone conversation, followed by a written  Wells  notice, that it is has made a preliminary
determination to recommend that the Commission file an enforcement action against the Company alleging violations of Section 13(a)
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. A Wells Notice is neither a formal
allegation of wrongdoing nor a finding that any violations of law have occurred. Rather, it provides the Company with an opportunity
to respond to issues raised by the Commission and offer its perspective prior to any SEC decision to institute proceedings. These
proceedings could result in the Company being subject to an injunction and cease and desist order from further violations of the
securities laws as well as monetary penalties of disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty.   

Though
the Company is not certain, it believes the Wells notice was issued as a result of the Company's failure to disclose within four
business (4) days on Form 8-K a material event regarding an unregistered sale of the Company's securities (the  Material
Event ). The Company subsequently reported the Material Event in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and has continued to include specific disclosure in connection with the Material Event in all of its subsequent quarterly
filings with the SEC.  

The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, any potential enforcement actions or any other impact on the Company
that may arise as a result of such investigation. The Company has not established a liability for this matter, because it believes
that the probability of loss related to this matter and an estimate of the amount of loss, if any, are not determinable at this
time. An adverse judgment or action of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows of the Company and their ability to raise funds in the future.  

On
September 20, 2016, the Company filed an amended and restated 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014 with the SEC. The relevant
portion of the restatement is summarized below:  

On
June 16, 2014, the Company entered into a set of agreements (collectively, the  Blackbridge Agreement ) with Blackbridge,
a financial services firm. The Company and Blackbridge were discussing an equity line of credit, and the Company agreed to pay
Blackbridge a commitment fee of 90,000,000 shares, and also issued a convertible note for $90,000 having a 5% interest rate that
matures on December 16, 2014. The note can be converted after the maturity date. The conversion price is 90% multiplied by the
market price, which is defined in the agreement as the lowest of the daily trading price for the common stock during the twenty
(20) trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date.  

The
Company computed the fair value of the conversion feature at the commitment date, based on the following management assumptions:  

The
fair value of the embedded conversion option on the commitment date was $82,210. In the second quarter, which was 14 days after
the commitment date, the Company should have recorded amortization expense of the debt discount of $6,289 on its income statement
in the second quarter of 2014. In addition, at June 30, 2014, the Company should have recorded $344 of additional interest expense
on its income statement in the second quarter of 2014. The book value of the (net) note payable on the balance sheet at 6/30/14
should have been the face value of the note less the unamortized debt discount at that point, which was $75,921, and including
the $344 of interest expense: $14,424.  

At
June 30, 2014, we remeasured the value of the derivative liability, according to the following assumptions:  

The
fair value of the embedded derivative at the commitment date was therefore remeasured to be $126,184. The difference of $43,974
was recorded as a change in the fair market value of the embedded derivative, and the derivative liability on the balance sheet
was increased to $126,184. On the income statement, the earnings number at June 30, 2014 should have decreased by $140,608. On
the statement of cash flows, cash flows used by operations should have decreased by $90,000, which was offset by increased borrowings
under a note payable in cash flows from financing.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has prepaid 12 months of legal services in shares, valued at $675,946.  

Note
11 - Per Share Information   

Loss
per share   

Basic
loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. 
Diluted loss per share of common stock ( Diluted EPS ) is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents and convertible securities then outstanding. At September
30, 2016 and 2015, there were 72,160,527 and 104,757,788 of potentially dilutive post-split common stock equivalents outstanding,
respectively. The potentially dilutive common stock equivalents at September 30, 2016 arise from (i) the issuance on December
7, 2011 of 45,000 Series B Preferred Shares which are convertible into 3,000 common shares, (ii) the issuance of 10,000 Series
C Preferred Shares having a stated value of $100 per share, of which 700 shares remain unconverted, which remaining unconverted
shares are convertible into 770 post-split common shares, given recent market prices, and notwithstanding a restriction against
owning more than 4.99% of the Company s stock, and (iii) the issuance of a note payable to GV Global which based on hypothetical
conversion at September 30, 2016 would have converted into 6,156,757 post-split common shares, and (iv) the issuance of 100,000
Series D Preferred Shares worth $120,000 to Vulcan, 34,000 of which have already been converted, the remainder (unconverted balance)
of which given hypothetical conversion at September 30, 2016 would have converted to 66,000,000 post-split shares. The potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents at September 30, 2015 arise from (i) the issuance on December 7, 2011 of 45,000 Series
B Preferred Shares which are convertible into 3,000 common shares, (ii) the issuance of 10,000 Series C Preferred Shares having
a stated value of $100 per share, of which 700 shares remain unconverted, which remaining unconverted shares are convertible into
770 post-split common shares, given recent market prices, and notwithstanding a restriction against owning more than 4.99% of
the Company s stock, and (iii) the issuance of a note to a third party Financier, which based on a theoretical conversion
at December 31, 2014 would have converted into post-split 3,871 shares of common stock, and (iv) the issuance of a Note I which
based on hypothetical conversion at September 30, 2015 would have converted into 9,999,947 post-split common shares, and (v) the
issuance of 100,000 Series D Preferred Shares worth $120,000 to Vulcan, 5,250 of which have already been converted during this
fiscal quarter, the remainder (unconverted balance) of which given hypothetical conversion at September 30, 2015 would have converted
to 94,750,000 post-split shares. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would
have an anti-dilutive effect on the net loss per common share. Share amounts are shown in post-split amounts to facilitate comparison
between the periods.    

Note
12   Concentrations   

Concentration
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk, consist principally of temporary cash investments.  

There
have been no losses in these accounts through September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Concentration
of revenue and accounts payable as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company has one customer, which counts 100%
of its revenue. Per the terms of the JV with the LLC, the LLC has committed to fund all Company s needs, as well as needs
of the JV. Failure of the LLC to provide the Company or the JV with said funding would represent a significant Credit Risk.  

Note
13 - Subsequent Events   

Management
has evaluated events that occurred subsequent to the end of the reporting period shown herein.  

On
or around October 26, 2016, a third party converted $14,302 of the Note I into 1,900,000 shares. This reduced the overall principal
balance on that note to $40,740. Including interest accrued at September 30, 2016, the note balance net of this conversion is
$43,549.  

On or around
November 10, 2016, the Company filed a complaint against Consultant in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Riverside,
for Breach of Contract and Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.

General Overview   

Gopher Protocol Inc. (the  Company ,
 we ,  us ,  our ,  Gopher  or  GOPH ) was incorporated on July 22,
2009, under the laws of the State of Nevada and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Since 2016, the Company is developing
a real-time, heuristic based, mobile technology. The technology being developed by the Company under license consists of a smart
microchip, mobile application software and supporting software that run on a server. The system contemplates the creation of a
global network. Upon development, the Company intends that its microchip technologies may be installed within mobile devices or
on SIM cards. Previously, the Company was principally engaged in offering consulting for foreign currency market trading to non-US
resident clients, professionals and retail clients. The Company s revenue in 2015 was related to consulting services provided
to one company in the foreign exchange business.  Our common stock trades on the OTC Markets
under the symbol  GOPH .  

Products:  

(i)   Guardian Patch   Guardian Sphere  - The Company has applied the mobile technology into
an electronic circuit including a proprietary microchip that is within a sticky patch package (the  Patch ). The Patch
can be affixed to any object, mobile or static, which will enable the object to which it is affixed to be tracked remotely. It
is our goal to have the electronic circuit communicate with other similar working patches via a separate, secured and private network.
Upon affixing the Patch on an object, the circuit is turned on, after which the electronic circuit regularly transmits an identification
signal in order to identify the device's geographical location. The Patch works in conjunction with a software application to provide
tracking function operations. The system includes its own power source. The Patch will also perform an emergency feature. In the
event of an emergency situation, one would simply peel the Patch off. Upon removing the Patch, it operates in a constant transmission
mode, sending emergency signals. The Patch also alerts the user's friends and family about the user's location. No GPS or conventional
network, such as GSM, is needed. The Company and its JV partner, Guardian Patch, LLC, are currently ramping-up their efforts for
the release of their Guardian Sphere tracking device, which is primarily designed for pets, but may also be used for tracking children,
adults, including the disabled, inventory, artwork or virtually any object located within an area covered by the device. The Guardian
Sphere (the  Sphere ) system is a derivative technology of the Company's Guardian Patch technology. The Sphere is designed
to provide its users with local tracking capability using a re-chargeable/replaceable battery source. The objective of the Company s
current efforts, which the Company hopes to achieve, is to deliver for testing in a pre-designated area 50 Guardian pet devices
along with a base station, test results and eventual manufacturing capability for both the mobile and the base unit. The Sphere
is an innovative tracking device that can easily be attached to a pet s collar and then transmit real-time location information
to the smartphone(s) or website account of the registered owner of the device. The Sphere has a replaceable battery and operates
on the exclusive Guardian private network which provides owners with the unique ability to obtain real-time tracking information
without the need for GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular service. The Sphere includes state of the art radio technology, a GPS system and micro
controller systems, with a potential  back-up  Bluetooth unit. The Sphere sends signals in specific intervals to report
on its location. The Sphere s system analyzes the information using its proprietary, advanced mathematical modeling software
that precisely calculates the Sphere's location. The Sphere's mobile application then presents the exact location of the Sphere
on the map. An additional unique system feature is the Sphere's Emergency Alert system. Users of the Sphere have the ability to
transmit emergency alerts directly from their mobile apps, which transmit their Sphere locations. All registered users located
in such a Sphere's proximity will be notified about the Emergency and may notify the user about the Sphere's recovery (which we
fondly refer to as a  private emergency alert ). The Sphere utilizes a bi-directional system which enables data transmission/receiving
acknowledgment. It also includes error correction protocol to ensure data accuracy. The Sphere has its own battery source and may
be plugged into external power using a standard Android type charger socket. The Sphere also comes with its own ID. This ID is
registered on the mobile app to track the Sphere's location. Multiple Spheres can be registered on the same app for multiple tracking.
The Company has not specified a sale release date for the Sphere.   

(ii)   Epsilon Mobile RV  - While developing the core technology of the Company and relying on prior
knowledge, the Company and its technology licensing partner, Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, developed Gopher Epsilon Software,
which is an internal, proprietary platform that has been developed as a designated tool for the mobile industry to accelerate signoff
Reliability Verification (RV) with Accurate and Precise Interactive Error Detection and Correction. The software is targeted
to assist microchip designers to produce power-aware, faster performance and longer lifespan integrated circuits. The software
significantly prolongs a battery's life, enabling mobile and static electronic devices longer operation time and better performance.   

(iii)   PUZPIX  - While developing the core technology of the Company, and relying on prior knowledge,
the Company and its technology licensing partner, Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, developed PUZPIX (version I) as a social
media game. PUZPIX is a social media game based on GOPHERINSIGHT  technology licensed by the Company. The game uses a computerized
framework to create a puzzle from images that users upload onto the system s server. The user creates an account and has
the option to store images in the designated  Friends  area and/or in the designated  All  (public) area. Only
approved friends will be granted access to the images in the  Friends  area and all players have access to the  All 
area. Upon a user s request, the system turns an image into a puzzle of at least nine pieces, though more challenging puzzles
can be made once the user achieves a higher level of skill. Upon the Company and its Partners launching their GopherInsight 
integrated circuit technology, of which there is no guarantee, the Company also hopes to develop a version III of PUZPIX to include
domestic / international exchanges of puzzle pieces that could be shared worldwide. In addition to allowing its users to upload
short videos to share with their PUZPIX  Friends , which appear as thumbprint puzzles of the videos, the new and advanced
Version 2.8 also allows its users to post links to YouTube videos, which also appear as thumbprint puzzles of the videos. Once
a personal video puzzle or a YouTube video puzzle has been assembled, the user can then watch the video in its entirety, immediately
after which the video automatically disappears and cannot be saved. The feature which allows users to upload videos from their
libraries can only be utilized between PUZPIX  Friends , while posting links to YouTube videos can be shared between
 All  users. The Company and its Partners are examining the possibility of launching a crowdfunding campaign for the
PUZPIX app.   

The Company and its technology licensing partners,
Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, are preparing to introduce two new products,  Epsilon  and  PuzPix ,
to the consumer markets this year and intend to introduce their  Sphere  technology in the first quarter of 2017. The
Epsilon product will be presented for time-based license agreements utilizing a designated website on top of customary distributing
channels for the product. 

On July
21, 2016, members of the LLC together with the Company's CTO, Dr. Rittman, formed the new entity Alpha EDA, LLC ( Alpha )
and Alpha appointed Dr. Rittman as its Manager. The Company, the LLC and Alpha have agreed that all rights to Epsilon and Puzpix
will be assigned to Alpha. Alpha and the Company will enter into a joint venture agreement (similar to the Patch JV agreement as
further described in Footnote 5), whereby Alpha will fund all of its operational and developmental needs (software development,
support, marketing and administrative) and the profits of Alpha will be distributed equally to the two equal JV partners, the LLC
and the Company Alpha will hold all intellectual property rights related to software. Currently, two products will be owned by
Alpha   the Epsilon software and the Puzpix social game.   

On June 30, 2015, the Company appointed Dr.
Rittman as Chief Technical Officer and a board member.  On August 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Dr.
Rittman pursuant to which the parties agreed that (i) all inventions, improvements and developments made or conceived by Dr. Rittman,
either solely or in collaboration with others pertaining to Company's business, will be the property of Company, and (ii) Dr. Rittman
will assign to the Company any and all intellectual property related to the Company's consumer heuristic technology platform. Dr.
Rittman is the Chief Technology Officer and a director of the Company as well as the Chairman of the Company's Advisory Board,
which is currently being formed. 

On April 16, 2016, Dr. Danny Rittman was appointed
by the Company as Co-Chairman of the Company. Mr. Rittman was serving as a director of the company at the time of his appointment
as Co-Chairman. Additionally, on April 19, 2016, in consideration of past accomplishments achieved by Dr. Rittman on behalf of
the Company and for future anticipated achievements, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with
Dr. Danny Rittman pursuant to which Mr. Rittman will continue to act as the Company's CTO for a term of one (1) year as extended
in consideration of a base salary of $12,000 per month from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2017. 

In March 2016, the Company and Dr. Danny Rittman,
Co-Chairman, CTO and a shareholder, entered into agreement intended to clarify the relationship between Dr. Rittman and the Company
and the ownership of certain technology in connection with certain agreements previously entered into between Company and Dr. Rittman
and with third parties. Prior to these agreements, the Company is the exclusive license holder for certain intellectual property
relating to Hermes  system and method for scheduling categorized deliverables, according to demand, at the customer s
location based on smartphone application and/or via the internet. As a result of these agreements, the Company shall remain a licensee
per the terms of the original License Agreement and will develop the first product with Dr. Rittman and his partners. 

On March 29, 2016, Gopher contributed all of
its rights relating to its proprietary microchip that is within a sticky patch package (the  Patch ) to Guardian Patch,
LLC (the  Guardian LLC ) in consideration of 50% of the profit generated by Guardian LLC (the  Joint Venture ).
Guardian LLC is responsible for investing all needed funds for the purpose of developing the Patch and related products to the
Patch. In addition, Guardian LLC is required to provide short term loans to Gopher on an as needed basis secured solely by Gopher s
economic interest in the Joint Venture. The Company will provide IT services to Guardian LLC for a monthly fee. Dr. Rittman has
signed an amendment employment agreement with the Company. 

On July
21, 2016 members of the Guardian Patch LLC together with Dr. Rittman incorporated Alpha EDA, LLC ( Alpha ). The members
of the LLC appointed Dr. Rittman as the manager of Alpha. The Company, the LLC and Alpha have agreed that all Epsilon Rights, as
well as Puzpix rights, will be assigned to Alpha. Alpha and the Company will enter into a JV agreement similar to the Patch Joint
Venture agreement (as described above), whereby Alpha will fund all of its operational and developmental needs (software development,
support, marketing and administrative), and the profits of Alpha will be distributed equally to the two equal Joint venture partners,
Guardian Patch LLC and the Company. Alpha will hold all intellectual property rights related to software. Currently, two products
will be owned by Alpha   the Epsilon software and the Puzpix social game.  The Company and its technology licensing
partners, Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, are preparing to introduce both new products (Epsilon   PuzPix) to the market
this year, and the Sphere in the first quarter of 2017. The Epsilon product will be presented for time-based license agreements
utilizing a designated website on top of customary distributing channels for the product. Epsilon which is under confidential evaluation
agreement with third party will be offered as a Time Base License, where the PUPIX potential income is based on potential advertisement
income. 

Results of Operations:   

Fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015  

A comparison of the statements of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Revenues: 

The following table summarizes our revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

During the first quarter of 2016, Guardian
Patch LLC, which funds the development of the Patch, was billed by the Company for IT services provided by Dr. Rittman for a monthly
fee of $30,000. The fee was billed for the first time in March, and the bill was paid. From April 1, 2016, and going forward, the
Company billed Guardian Patch LLC $15,000 per month. 

In the quarter ended on September 30, 2015,
the Company was able to leverage its consulting expertise in the area of foreign exchange. Revenue derived from one customer in
both cases, but the periods are not comparable due to the differing nature of the services provided in each case. 

Operating expenses: 

The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Operating costs in the current period
were much higher than the prior period, mainly due to higher marketing costs, patent fees, programming fees, and IT services
costs. Marketing costs include the Waterford agreement, including the warrant issued for those services. The current period
reflects the issuance of a warrant to Waterford. The warrant expense was calculated using Black-Scholes, although the strike
price at $2.25 means that the option is currently out of the money. The Company revalued the warrant expense based on a stock
price at September 30, 2016 of $0.40, and the historical volatility is 339%. We have expensed only the portion of the warrant
that was vested at June 30, 2016, due to the counterparty s failure to perform under the agreement; 93,750 shares
vested under the agreement with Waterford in the second quarter, when the agreement was consummated. The current period reflects a significant change in the fair market value of the
warrant on 93,750 shares issued to Waterford in the previous (second) quarter. This reflects a significant change in the
stock price at the end of the third fiscal quarter, and a higher volatility than in the previous quarter. This is a non-cash
adjustment to the warrant value, and the warrant will be marked to market each quarter for their remaining life, which at
September 30, 2016 is 4.7 years. 

Legal costs include
prepaid legal expenses valued at $675,946.  

Other income (expense): 

The following table summarizes our other income
(expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The periods are roughly comparable in both
interest income and interest expense. The Company has converted a number of notes to equity, and had restructured its balance sheet
in 2015. Currently, there is only the Note I note outstanding; in the prior period, there were 2 notes, but on the Note I note,
the unamortized balance was much lower. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015  

A comparison of the statements of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Revenues: 

The following table summarizes our revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

During the first quarter of 2016, Guardian
Patch LLC, which funds the development of the Patch, was billed by the Company for IT services provided by Dr. Rittman for a monthly
fee of $30,000. The fee was billed for the first time in March, and the bill was paid. From April 1, 2016, and going forward, the
Company billed Guardian Patch LLC $15,000 per month. 

In the quarter ended on September 30, 2015,
the Company was able to leverage its consulting expertise in the area of foreign exchange. Revenue derived from one customer in
both cases, but the periods are not comparable due to the differing nature of the services provided in each case. 

Operating expenses: 

The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Operating costs in the current period
were much higher than the prior period, mainly due to higher marketing costs, patent fees, programming fees, and IT services costs.
Marketing costs include the Waterford agreement, including the warrant issued for those services. The current period reflects the
issuance of a warrant to Waterford. The warrant expense was calculated using Black-Scholes, although the strike price at $2.25
means that the option is currently out of the money. The Company revalued the warrant expense based on a stock price at September
30, 2016 of $0.40, and the historical volatility is 339%. We have expensed only the portion of the warrant that was vested at June
30, 2016, due to the counterparty s failure to perform under the agreement; 93,750 shares vested under the agreement with
Waterford in the second quarter, when the agreement was consummated. The current period reflects a significant change in the fair
market value of the warrant on 93,750 shares issued to Waterford in the previous (second) quarter. This reflects a significant
change in the stock price at the end of the third fiscal quarter, and a higher volatility than in the previous quarter. This is
a non-cash adjustment to the warrant value, and the warrant will be marked to market each quarter for their remaining life, which
at September 30, 2016 is 4.7 years. 

Legal costs include prepaid legal expenses valued at $675,946. 

Other income (expense): 

The following table summarizes our other income
(expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The periods are roughly comparable in both
interest income and interest expense. The Company has converted a number of notes to equity, and had restructured its balance sheet
in 2015. Currently, there is only the Note I note outstanding; in the prior period, there were 2 notes, but on the Note I note,
the unamortized balance was much lower. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our cash and cash equivalents were $46,933
and $1 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Cash flows provided by operations in the first nine months
of 2016 was $25,882, compared to cash flows provided by operations of $1 in the first nine months of 2015. Working capital year
to date 2016 improved significantly from the same period in 2015: other assets and accounts receivable decreased from the beginning
of the year, and prepaid expenses increased, but less than in the prior period. Accounts payable increased by $411,304 from the
beginning of the year, compared to an increase of $57,256 in the prior period. 

Non-cash items included shares issued for marketing
services from Waterford valued at approximately $13,000, shares issued for legal services valued at $675,946, and a non-cash warrant
expense of $37,480. In the prior period, the Company issued shares for marketing valued at approximately $26,000. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of additional income and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company sustained
net losses of $1,300,340 in the first nine months of the year, and our operating activities provided $25,882 in the first nine
months of the year. Our net loss was caused in part by a non-cash warrant expense of $37,480, which has been revalued at September
30, 2016, and prepaid legal services valued at $675,946. The Company had a working capital deficit of $493,638, stockholders 
deficit of $531,446, and accumulated deficit of $3,808,486 at September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and its ability to continue receiving
investment capital and loans from third parties to sustain its current level of operations. The Company is in the process of securing
working capital from investors for common stock, convertible notes payable, and/or strategic partnerships. No assurance can be
given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Per the Joint Venture agreement, the Guardian Patch LLC has committed
to provide the Company with all its working capital needs, the LLC s commitment has decreased much of the risk of going concern. 

We plan to raise working
capital that will allow us to conduct our business for the next 12 months. There is no guarantee regarding our ability to raise
that capital. We expect to use the proceeds to fund our short-term capital requirements including paying administrative expenses
associated with maintaining our public company s filings for the next 12 months. In order to implement our business
plan and pay various administrative expenses on a minimal basis for the next 12 months, we expect that we will need approximately
$600,000, based on our monthly burn rate. The Company expects that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter
to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors including the state of the worldwide economy and financial markets,
which are outside the Company s control. Guardian Patch, LLC, the Company s JV partner, has committed to support the
Company s working capital needs, via short terms loans. 

Debt Financing Arrangements   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has only
one convertible note outstanding with a third party ( Note I ). The current note balance at September 30, 2016 is $46,344,
which includes $9,660 of accrued interest. At December 31, 2015, the Company had only this note outstanding as well. The balance
at that time was $38,924, which included accrued interest of $6,851. 

On January 22, 2015, the Company entered into
an Exchange Agreement with the original holder of Note I pursuant to which Note I exchanged $75,273 in debt into a 10% Convertible
Debenture in the principal amount of $75,273 (the  Note ). The Note I Note matures January 21, 2017 (the  Maturity
Date ) and interest associated with the Note I Note is 10% per annum, which is payable on the Maturity Date. The Note I Note
is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at the option of Note I, at a fixed conversion price of $0.00752734. 

Note I has agreed to restrict its ability to
convert the Note I Note and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by it in the aggregate
and its affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. The Note I Note was issued to Note I in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the
Securities Act of 1933. Note I is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933. In addition, on March 2, 2015, the Company and Note I amended that certain 10% Convertible Debenture (the  Note
I Debenture ) which debt underlying the Note I Debenture was initially incurred on October 6, 2009 and exchanged for the
Note I Debenture on January 19, 2014. The parties agreed that the conversion price in the Note I Debenture would not be impacted
by the 1:1,000 stock split implemented by the Company on February 24, 2015 and will remain $0.0075273. Beneficial Conversion Feature
( BCF ) in the amount of $75,273 has not yet been fully amortized from the note balance. As of September 30, 2016,
$8,698 remains to be amortized. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates   

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of our
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts and classification
of revenues and expenses during the periods presented, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our
estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and material changes in these estimates or assumptions could occur in the future.
Changes in estimates are recorded on the period in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that time, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ materially from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially
accurate. 

We believe that the accounting policies described
below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations, and financial condition because they involve significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. An accounting is deemed to be critical if it requires
a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, and if different estimates
that could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially
impact our financial statements. Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those
discussed below, are also critical to understanding our financial statements. The notes to our financial statements contain additional
information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion. 

Presentation and Basis of Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements include
the accounts of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ). 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognized revenue on arrangements
in accordance with FASB Codification Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC Topic 605 ). Under ASC Topic
605, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service
is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We had revenue of $45,000 and $22,500 for the
fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 100% of the Company s
revenue was related to IT service provided to the LLC for Dr. Rittman services, in connection with the development of the Patch. 

Dividends   

The Company has not yet adopted any policy
regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid or declared since the Date of Inception. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK   

As a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company
is not required to include the disclosure under this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the applicable period to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As a smaller reporting company, without a viable business and revenues, the Company does not have the resources to install a dedicated
staff with deep expertise in all facets of SEC disclosure and GAAP compliance. As is the case with many smaller reporting companies,
the Company will continue to consult with its external auditors and attorneys as it relates to new accounting principles and changes
to SEC disclosure requirements. The Company has found that this approach worked well in the past and believes it to be the most
cost effective solution available for the foreseeable future. The Company will conduct a review of existing sign-off and review
procedures as well as document control protocols for critical accounting spreadsheets. The Company will also increase management s
review of key financial documents and records. 

As a smaller reporting
company, the Company does not have the resources to fund sufficient staff to ensure a complete segregation of responsibilities
within the accounting function. However, Company management does review, and will increase the review of, financial statements
on a monthly basis, and the Company s external auditor conducts reviews on a quarterly basis. These actions, in addition
to the improvements identified above, will minimize any risk of a potential material misstatement occurring. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes in the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

From time to time, the Company may be involved
in various litigation matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There is currently no litigation that management
believes will have a material impact on the financial position of the Company. 

On July
29, 2016,  the  staff of the Atlanta Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC  and the  Commission ) advised the Company in a telephone conversation, followed
by a written  Wells  notice, that it is has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the Commission file
an enforcement action against the Company alleging violations of Section 13(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules
13a-11, 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder. A Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation of wrongdoing nor a finding that any violations
of law have occurred. Rather, it provides the Company with an opportunity to respond to issues raised by the Commission and offer
its perspective prior to any SEC decision to institute proceedings. These proceedings could result in the Company being subject
to an injunction and cease and desist order from further violations of the securities laws as well as monetary penalties of disgorgement,
pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty.  

Though
the Company is not certain, it believes the Wells notice was issued as a result of the Company's failure to disclose within four
business (4) days on Form 8-K a material event regarding an unregistered sale of the Company's securities (the  Material Event ).
The Company subsequently reported the Material Event in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
has filed an amended and restated 10-Q for second quarter of 2014 with the SEC.  

On or around November 10, 2016, the Company filed a complaint against
Consultant in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Riverside, for Breach of Contract and Breach of Implied Covenant
of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.   

As a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide the information required by this item.

21, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ) and interest associated with the GV Note is 10% per annum, which is payable on the Maturity
Date. The GV Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company, at the option of GV Global, at a conversion price
of $0.00752734. GV Global has agreed to restrict its ability to convert the GV Note and receive shares of common stock such that
the number of shares of common stock held by it in the aggregate and its affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not
exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The GV Note was issued to GV Global in reliance upon exemptions
from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the Securities Act of 1933. GV Global is an accredited investor as defined

underlying the GV Debenture was initially incurred on October 6, 2009 and exchanged for the GV Debenture on January 19, 2014. The

stock (the  Blackbridge Shares ) upon Blackbridge submitting a conversion notice converting a Convertible Promissory

without a standard restrictive legend as Blackbridge delivered a legal opinion to remove the restrictive legend under Rule 144
together with the conversion note. The Company believes that Blackbridge was in breach of the agreements entered with the Company
in September 2014. The Company is contemplating commencing litigation against Blackbridge in connection with this matter.
