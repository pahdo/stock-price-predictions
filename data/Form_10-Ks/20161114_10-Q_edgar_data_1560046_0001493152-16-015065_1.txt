1.   
       Organization
    and Nature of Operations     

Organization
    SQN AIF IV, L.P. (the  Partnership ) was formed on August 10, 2012, as a Delaware limited partnership
and is engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and investment in leased equipment and related financings which includes:
(i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring
equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration.
The Partnership will terminate no later than December 31, 2036.  

Nature
of Operations     The principal investment strategy of the Partnership is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-savings) equipment or other physical assets with high in-place value and long, relative to the investment term, economic
life and project financings. The Partnership executes its investment strategy by making investments in equipment already subject
to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party
end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset and project financings; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv)
acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to time, the Partnership
may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to its leasing customers. The Partnership may use other investment structures
that SQN Capital Management, LLC (the  Investment Manager ) believes will provide the Partnership with an appropriate
level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize its return on its investment while protecting against downside
risk. In many cases, the structure will include the Partnership holding title to or a priority or controlling position in the
equipment or other asset.  

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF IV GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership s Investment Manager. Both the Partnership s General Partner and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited
liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls the day to day activities and operations of the Partnership, pursuant
to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital contribution of $100 for a 1%
interest in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and
manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership.  

On
June 3, 2015, SQN Alpha, LLC ( Alpha ), a special purpose entity which is 32.5% owned by the Partnership and 67.5%
owned by SQN Portfolio Acquisition Company, LLC ( SQN PAC ), acquired a promissory note with a principal amount equal
to $2,650,000. The promissory note accrues interest at the rate of 11.1% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, and matures
on June 30, 2020. The promissory note is secured by a pledge of shares in an investment portfolio of insurance companies under
common control of the third party which include equipment leases, direct hard assets and infrastructure investments, and other
securities. On June 3, 2015, a participation agreement was entered into between SQN PAC ( Alpha Participation A ),
the Partnership ( Alpha Participation B ), Alpha and SQN Capital Management, LLC. Under the agreement, Alpha created
two collateralized participation interests for the collateral ( Promissory Note ); Alpha Participation A s principal
contribution is $1,788,750 and accrues interest at 9% per annum and Alpha Participation B s principal contribution is $861,250
and accrues interest at 15.05% per annum. SQN Capital Management, LLC was appointed as a servicer for the Promissory Note. Alpha
Participation A s interest is senior to Alpha Participation B s interest. Since the Partnership bears the primary
risks and rewards of Alpha, the Partnership consolidates Alpha into the consolidated financial statements. SQN PAC s 67.5%
investment in Alpha is presented as non-controlling interest on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

On
December 2, 2015, the Partnership formed a special purpose entity SQN Juliet, LLC ( Juliet ), a limited liability
company registered in the state of Delaware which is wholly owned by the Partnership. On December 29, 2015, Juliet entered into
a loan agreement with a third party to borrow $3,071,000 for the funding of two loan facilities. The loan accrues interest at
the rate of 8.5% per annum and matures on December 29, 2016. On December 31, 2015, Juliet extended two separate loan facilities
to two borrowers. The borrowers are both subsidiaries of a UK based parent company that provides small and medium sized secured
business loans ( Just Loans ). Each facility provides financing up to a maximum borrowing of  5,037,500 or together
a total of  10,075,000 and accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The funds can be drawn down in increments of up
to  1,000,000 per month per facility with the exception of the first draws which were each in the amount of  1,037,500
in order to fund a certain third party fee of  37,500. The funds can be drawn up to the one year anniversary of the loan
facilities or December 31, 2016 ( Availability Date ). The loan is repayable in monthly interest only payments due
on the last day of each month. Principal is due nine months after the Availability Date or September 30, 2017 ( Termination
Date ). The loans are secured by share pledges of the borrowers, a guaranty from the UK based parent company, and the underlying
loan portfolio that Just Loans generates. On December 29, 2015, a participation agreement was entered into between a third party
( Juliet Participation A ), the Partnership ( Juliet Participation B ), and Juliet. In connection with
the participation agreement, the Partnership assigned to Juliet various finance leases and equipment notes receivables with a
total value equal to $4,866,750. Under the agreement, Juliet created two collateralized participation interests for the underlying
loans ( Underlying Loans ); Juliet Participation A s principal balance is $3,071,000 and accrues interest at
8.5% per annum and Juliet Participation B s principal balance is the value of their assigned finance leases and equipment
notes receivable of $4,866,750. Juliet Participation A s interest is senior to Juliet Participation B s interest.
On April 22, 2016, the participation agreement dated December 29, 2015 between Juliet Participation A, Juliet Participation B,
and Juliet was amended and restated. In connection with the amended participation agreement, Juliet Participation A funded Juliet
cash of approximately $8,511,000 and assigned their interests of approximately $3,986,000 in a loan facility for a wood pellet
business in Texas, which along with the outstanding principal payable balance of approximately $2,124,000 on the Just Loans transaction
resulted in a Juliet Participation A balance of approximately $14,621,000. Under the amended agreement, Juliet Participation A s
principal balance accrues interest at 6% per annum and Juliet Participation B s principal balance accrues interest at 12%
per annum. Juliet Participation A s interest is senior to Juliet Participation B s interest.  

On
December 16, 2015, SQN Marine, LLC ( Marine ), a special purpose vehicle which is wholly owned by the Partnership,
entered into a sale and assignment of partnership interest agreement with the Partnership and a third party. Under the terms of
the agreement, Marine acquired an 88.20% (90% of 98%) economic interest in a portfolio of container feeder vessels, for an aggregate
investment of $28,266,789. Marine contributed cash of $12,135,718 and entered into two loans payable with separate third parties
of $7,500,000 and $9,604,091. Marine acquired their economic interest in the vessels through a limited partnership interest in
CONT Feeder Portfolio GmbH   Co. KG, a Germany based limited partnership ( CONT Feeder ), which acquired and operates
the container feeder vessels, and entered into a separate note payable with an unrelated third party of $14,375,654. Marine bears
the risks and rewards of ownership of CONT Feeder and therefore Marine consolidates the financial statements of CONT Feeder. Since
the Partnership bears the primary risks and rewards of Marine, the Partnership consolidates Marine into the consolidated financial
statements. A third party contributed $3,140,754 to purchase a 10% share of CONT Feeder which is presented as non-controlling
interest on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

The
Partnership s income, losses and distributions are allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until
the Limited Partners have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an 8% per year, compounded annually,
cumulative return on their capital contributions. After such time, all income, losses and distributable cash will be allocated
80% to the Limited Partners and 20% to the General Partner. The Partnership is currently in the Operating Period. The Offering
Period concluded on April 2, 2016, which was three years from the date the Partnership was declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). During the Operating Period, the Partnership will invest most of the net proceeds
from its offering in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets with substantial
economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and project financings. The Operating Period began on the date of
the Partnership s initial closing, which occurred on May 29, 2013 and will last for three years unless extended at the sole
discretion of the General Partner. The General Partner has extended the Operating Period for an additional one year. The Liquidation
Period, which follows the conclusion of the Operating Period, is the period in which the Partnership will sell its assets in the
ordinary course of business and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner.  

SQN
Securities, LLC ( Securities ), is a Delaware limited liability company and a majority-owned subsidiary of the Investment
Manager. Securities, was the Partnership s selling agent, and received an underwriting fee of 3% of the gross proceeds from
Limited Partners  capital contributions (excluding proceeds, if any, the Partnership received from the sale of its Units
to the General Partner or its affiliates). In addition, the Partnership paid a 7% sales commission to broker-dealers unaffiliated
with the General Partner who sold the Partnership s Units, on a best efforts basis. When the 7% sales commission was not
required to be paid, the Partnership applied the proceeds that would otherwise be payable as sales commission toward the purchase
of additional fractional Units at $1,000 per Unit.  

During
the Operating Period, the Partnership plans to make quarterly distributions of cash to the Limited Partners, if, in the opinion
of the Partnership s Investment Manager, such distributions are in the Partnership s best interests. Therefore, the
amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6.5% annually, paid
quarterly as 1.625%, of each Limited Partners  capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited
Partner). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership declared and made quarterly cash distributions to its
Limited Partners totaling $4,221,320. As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership has accrued $70,073 for distributions payable
to the General Partner.  

From
May 29, 2013 through April 2, 2016, the Partnership admitted 1,508 Limited Partners with total capital contributions of $74,965,064
resulting in the sale of 74,965.07 Units. The Partnership received cash contributions of $72,504,327 and applied $2,460,737 which
would have otherwise been paid as sales commission to the purchase of 2,460.74 additional Units.  

2.   
       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation     The condensed consolidated financial statements of SQN AIF IV, L.P. and Subsidiaries at September
30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial
information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not necessarily be taken as indicative of results
that may be expected for the entire year. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes
thereto contained in the Partnership s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the
SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation         The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership
and its entities, where the Partnership has the primary economic benefits of ownership. The Partnership s consolidation
policy requires the consolidation of entities where a controlling financial interest is held as well as the consolidation of variable
interest entities in which the Partnership has the primary economic benefits. All material intercompany balances and transactions
are eliminated in consolidation.  

Non-controlling
interest represents the minority equity holders  investment in Alpha and CONT Feeder plus the minority s share of
the net operating results and other components of equity relating to the non-controlling interest.  

Variable
interests are investments or other interests that absorb portions of a variable interest entity s ( VIE ) expected
losses or receive portions of the Partnership s expected residual returns and are contractual, ownership, or other pecuniary
interests in a VIE that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE. An entity is considered to be a VIE if any of the following
conditions exist. (1) The total equity investment at risk is insufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support; or (2) As a group, the holders of equity investments at risk lack any of the
three characteristics of a controlling financial interest: (a) The direct or indirect ability through voting or similar rights
to make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the legal entity. The equity holders at risk are deemed to
lack this characteristic if: i. the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligation to absorb the expected
losses of the legal entity or rights to receive expected residual returns; and ii. substantially all of the legal entity s
activities are either involved with or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights (b)
The obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or (c) The right to receive the expected residual returns of
the legal entity. An entity that is determined to be a VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The primary
beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect
the VIE s economic performance ( Power ) and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits
from the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE ( Benefits ). The determination of whether a reporting
entity is the primary beneficiary involves complex and subjective analyses.  

Use
of estimates     The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
the General Partner and Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates primarily include the determination
of allowances for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, estimated useful
lives, and residual values. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents     The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds maintained in checking and money market
accounts maintained at financial institutions.  

The
Partnership s cash and cash equivalents are held principally at one financial institution and at times may exceed federally
insured limits. The Partnership has placed these funds in an international financial institution in order to minimize risk relating
to exceeding insured limits. The Partnership, through Summit Asset Management Limited, maintains an unrestricted bank account
at a major financial institution in the United Kingdom for purposes of receiving payments and funding transactions in Pound Sterling.  

Credit
Risk     In the normal course of business, the Partnership is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that
the Partnerships  counterparty to an agreement either has an inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments.
The Partnership expects concentrations of credit risk with respect to lessees to be dispersed across different industry segments
and different regions of the world.  

Asset
Impairments     Assets in the Partnership s investment portfolio, which are considered long-lived assets, are
periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators of impairment exist, to determine whether events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If there is an indication of
impairment, the Partnership estimates the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash inflows expected to be generated by an asset
less the future outflows expected to be necessary to obtain those inflows. If an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment
loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the
statement of operations in the period the determination is made. The events or changes in circumstances that generally indicate
that an asset may be impaired are, (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying equipment is less than its carrying value, (ii)
the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and (iii) it does not appear likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition
of the asset will be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires
the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future rents or receipts from the sale of the investment, estimated
downtime between re-leasing events, and the amount of re-leasing costs. The Investment Manager s review for impairment includes
a consideration of the existence of impairment indicators, including third party appraisals, published values for similar assets,
recent transactions for similar assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types, and the occurrence of significant
adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.  

Lease
Classification and Revenue Recognition     The Partnership records revenue based upon the lease classification determined
at the inception of the transaction and based upon the terms of the lease or when there are significant changes to the lease terms.  

The
Partnership leases equipment to third parties and each such lease may be classified as either a finance lease or an operating
lease. Initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease for a finance lease. For an operating
lease, initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated.  

For
finance leases, the Partnership records, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the
estimated unguaranteed residual value of the equipment upon lease termination, the initial direct costs, if any, related to the
lease and the related unearned income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments
receivable plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized
as finance income over the term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.  

For
operating leases, rental income is recognized on the straight line basis over the lease term. Billed and uncollected operating
lease receivables will be included in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value.
Rental income received in advance is the difference between the timing of the cash payments and the income recognized on the straight
line basis.  

The
investment committee of the Investment Manager approves each new equipment lease, financing transaction, and lease acquisition.
As part of this process it determines the unguaranteed residual value, if any, to be used once the acquisition has been approved.
The factors considered in determining the unguaranteed residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of
the potential lessee, the type of equipment being considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessees 
business, the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed
for impairment in accordance with the Partnership s policy relating to impairment review.  

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset will be utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a
significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is
calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers
and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.  

Finance
Lease Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Lease, Notes and Loan Accounts     In the normal course of business,
the Partnership provides credit or financing to its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers, and maintains reserves
for potential credit losses. These credit or financing transactions are normally collateralized by the equipment being financed.
In determining the amount of allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts, the Investment Manager considers historical
credit losses, the past due status of receivables, payment history, and other customer-specific information, including the value
of the collateral. The past due status of a receivable is based on its contractual terms. Expected credit losses are recorded
as an allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts. Receivables are written off when the Investment Manager determines
they are uncollectible. At September 30, 2016, an allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts is not currently provided
since, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, all accounts recorded on the books are deemed collectible.  

Equipment
Notes and Loans Receivable     Equipment notes and loans receivable are reported in the condensed consolidated financial
statements as the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized deferred fees, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans.
Costs to originate loans, if any, are reported as other assets in the condensed consolidated financial statements and amortized
to expense over the estimated life of the loan. Income is recognized over the life of the note agreement. On certain equipment
notes and loans receivable, specific payment terms were reached requiring prepayments which resulted in the recognition of unearned
interest income. Unearned income, discounts and premiums, if any, are amortized to interest income in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations using the effective interest rate method. Equipment notes and loans receivable are generally placed in
a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due and all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Additionally, the
Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon
the Investment Manager s judgment, accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status. Accounts on a non-accrual status are
only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and the Partnership believes recovery of the remaining
unpaid receivable is probable. Revenue on non-accrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received.  

Initial
Direct Costs     The Partnership capitalizes initial direct costs associated with the origination and funding of lease
assets. These costs are amortized on a lease by lease basis over the actual contract term of each lease using the effective interest
rate method for finance leases and the straight-line method for operating leases. Upon disposal of the underlying lease assets,
both the initial direct costs and the associated accumulated amortization are relieved. Costs related to leases that are not consummated
are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense.  

Equity
Method     The Partnership records its 24.5% investment in Informage SQN Technologies LLC and its 50% investment in
SQN Helo, LLC using the equity method of accounting. According to U.S. GAAP, a company that holds 20% or greater investment in
another company could potentially exercise significant influence over the investee company s operating and financing activities
and should therefore utilize the equity method of accounting. The Partnership s portion of earnings in the investee are
recorded as an increase in its investment and recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and any distributions
received from the investee are recorded as a reduction in its investment.  

Acquisition
Expense     Acquisition expense represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel
and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses, and miscellaneous expenses related to the selection
and acquisition of leased equipment which are incurred by the Partnership under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, as amended.
As these costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.  

Income
Taxes     As a partnership, no provision for income taxes is recorded since the liability for such taxes is the responsibility
of each of the Partners rather than the Partnership. The Partnership s income tax returns are subject to examination by
the federal and state taxing authorities, and changes, if any, could adjust the individual income tax of the Partners.  

Per
Share Data     Net income or loss attributable to Limited Partners per weighted average number of limited partnership
interests outstanding is calculated as follows; the net income or loss allocable to the Limited Partners divided by the weighted
average number of limited partnership interests outstanding during the period.  

Foreign
Currency Transactions     The Partnership has designated the United States of America dollar as the functional currency
for the Partnership s investments denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, certain assets and liabilities are translated
at either the reporting period exchange rates or the historical exchange rates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average
rate of exchange for the period, and all transaction gains or losses are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations.  

Depreciation
    The Partnership, and all consolidated entities, records depreciation expense on equipment when the lease is classified
as an operating lease. In order to calculate depreciation, the Partnership first determines the depreciable equipment cost, which
is the cost less the estimated residual value. The estimated residual value is the Partnership s estimate of the value of
the equipment at lease termination. Depreciation expense is recorded by applying the straight-line method of depreciation to the
depreciable equipment cost over the lease term.       

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities (Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to Leases Analysis),
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.
The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases
on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective
transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use
certain transition relief. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

In
February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new guidance to improve consolidation guidance
for legal entities ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis), effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The new standard is
intended to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations, and securitization structures. The amendments in the ASU affect the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations.
In addition, the amendments in this ASU simplify and improve current U.S. GAAP by reducing the number of consolidation models.
The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

General Partner is responsible for the operations of the Partnership and the Investment Manager makes all investment decisions
and manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership. The Partnership pays the General Partner a fee for organizational and
offering costs not to exceed 2% of all capital contributions received by the Partnership. Because organizational and offering
expenses will be paid, as and to the extent they are incurred, organizational and offering expenses may be drawn disproportionately
to the gross proceeds of each closing. The General Partner also has a promotional interest in the Partnership equal to 20% of
all distributed distributable cash, after the Partnership has provided an 8% cumulative return, compounded annually, to the Limited
Partners on their capital contributions. The General Partner has a 1% interest in the profits, losses and distributions of the
Partnership. The General Partner will initially receive 1% of all distributed distributable cash, which was accrued at September

an amount equal to at least 15% of the Partnership s Limited Partners  capital contributions have been returned to
the Limited Partners, after which the monthly management fee will equal 100% of the management fee as initially calculated above,
less 1% for each additional 1% of the Partnership s Limited Partners  capital contributions returned to them. Such
amounts are measured on the last day of each month. The management fee is paid regardless of the performance of the Partnership

Overview    

We
were organized as a Delaware limited partnership on August 10, 2012 and are engaged in a single business segment, the ownership
and investment in leased equipment and related financings which includes: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party
end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership
rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. We will terminate no later than December 31, 2036.  

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF IV GP, LLC (the  General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership s Investment Manager, SQN Capital Management, LLC (the  Investment Manager ). Both the Partnership s
General Partner and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls
the day to day activities and operations of the Partnership, pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The General Partner
paid an aggregate capital contribution of $100 for a 1% interest in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions.
The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership.  

Our
Offering period commenced on April 2, 2013 and concluded on April 2, 2016, which is three years from the commencement of our Offering
Period.  

Our
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until the Limited Partners
have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an 8% per year, compounded annually, cumulative return
on their capital contributions. After such time, all distributable cash will be allocated 80% to the Limited Partners and 20%
to the General Partner. We are currently in the Operating and Liquidation Period. The Offering Period concluded on April 2, 2016,
which is three years from the date we were declared effective by the SEC. During the Operating Period, we will invest most of
the net proceeds from our offering in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets
with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and project financings. The Operating Period began
on the date of our initial closing, which occurred on May 29, 2013 and will last for three years unless extended at the sole discretion
of the General Partner. The General Partner has extended the Operating Period for an additional one year. The Liquidation Period,
which follows the conclusion of the Operating Period, is the period in which we will sell our assets in the ordinary course of
business and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner.  

SQN
Securities, LLC ( Securities ), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Investment Manager, is currently acting as our
exclusive selling agent. We paid 3% of the gross proceeds of the offering (excluding proceeds, if any, we receive from the sale
of its Units to the General Partner or its affiliates) to its selling agent or selling agents as an underwriting fee. In addition,
we paid a 7% sales commission to broker-dealers unaffiliated with our General Partner who sold our Units, on a best efforts basis.
When Units were not sold by unaffiliated broker-dealers, the 7% sales commission was not required to be paid. We applied the proceeds
that would otherwise be payable as Sales Commission toward the purchase of additional fractional Units at $1,000 per Unit.  

During
our Operating Period, which began on May 29, 2013, the date of our initial closing, we will use the majority of our net offering
proceeds from Limited Partner capital contributions to acquire our initial investments. As our investments mature, we anticipate
reinvesting the cash proceeds in additional investments in leased equipment and project financing transactions, to the extent
that the cash will not be needed for expenses, reserves and distributions to our limited partners. During this time-frame we expect
both rental income and finance income to increase substantially as well as related expenses such as depreciation and amortization.
During the Operating Period we believe the majority of our cash outflows will be from investing activities as we acquire additional
investments and to a lesser extend from financing activities from our paying quarterly distributions to our limited partners.
Our cash flow from operations is expected to increase, primarily from the collection of rental payments.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we made distributions to our Limited Partners totaling $4,221,320.  

Our
principal investment strategy is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-savings) equipment with high in-place
value and long, relative to the investment term, economic life and project financings. We expect to achieve our investment strategy
by making investments in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include:
(i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring
equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration.
From time to time, we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers.  

Many
of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating leases. Full payout leases generally are leases under which
the rent over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration
of the residual value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the expiration of the lease term. Operating
leases generally are leases under which the aggregate non-cancelable rental payments during the original term of the lease, on
a net present value basis, are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the
lease.  

We
also intend to invest by way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in
a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to the equipment or other assets, at a future date. We may invest in operating
companies that use or own equipment and other assets. We also may structure investments as project financings that are secured
by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment structures that our Investment
Manager believes will provide us with the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize our return
on our investment while protecting against downside risk, such as vendor and rental programs. In many cases, the structure will
include us holding title to or a priority or controlling position in the equipment or other asset.  

Although
the final composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in equipment and other assets that
are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing,
technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment
objectives. We expect to invest in equipment, other assets and project financings located primarily within the United States of
America and the European Union but may also make investments in other parts of the world.

Critical
Accounting Policies    

An
understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of condensed
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires our General Partner and our Investment Manager to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates will primarily include the determination of allowance for doubtful
lease, notes and loan accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and the estimated useful lives and residual values
of the leased equipment we acquire. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Lease
Classification and Revenue Recognition   

Each
equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, which is determined at lease inception,
based upon the terms of each lease, or when there are significant changes to the lease terms. We capitalize initial direct costs
associated with the origination and funding of lease assets. Initial direct costs include both internal costs (e.g., labor and
overhead), if any, and external broker fees incurred with the lease origination. Costs related to leases that are not consummated
are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense. For a finance
lease, initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the lease term using the effective interest rate method. For an
operating lease, the initial direct costs are included as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease
term.  

For
finance leases, we record, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed
residual value of the equipment at lease termination, the initial direct costs related to the lease, if any, and the related unearned
income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated
unguaranteed residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the
term of the lease using the effective interest rate method.  

For
operating leases, rental income is recognized on the straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables
are included in accounts receivable until collected. Accounts receivable is stated at its estimated net realizable value. Deferred
revenue is the difference between the timing of the receivables billed and the income recognized on the straight-line basis.  

Our
Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other project financing transaction.
As part of its process, the investment committee determines the residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been
approved. The factors considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the
potential lessee, the type of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee s business,
the length of the lease and the industry in which the potential lessee operates. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in
accordance with our impairment review policy.  

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset will be utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market.
Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a
significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is
calculated using information from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers
and industry experts, as well as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators.  

Asset
Impairments   

The
significant assets in our investment portfolio are periodically reviewed, no less frequently than annually or when indicators
of impairment exist, to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value. If there is an indication of impairment, we will estimate the future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Future cash flows are the future cash
in-flows expected to be generated by an asset less the future out-flows expected to be necessary to obtain those in-flows. If
an impairment is determined to exist, the impairment loss will be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of a long-lived
asset exceeds its fair value and recorded in the statement of operations in the period the determination is made. The events or
changes in circumstances that generally indicate that an asset may be impaired are, (i) the estimated fair value of the underlying
equipment is less than its carrying value, (ii) the lessee is experiencing financial difficulties and (iii) it does not appear
likely that the estimated proceeds from the disposition of the asset will be sufficient to satisfy the residual position in the
asset. The preparation of the undiscounted cash flows requires the use of assumptions and estimates, including the level of future
rents, the residual value expected to be realized upon disposition of the asset, estimated downtime between re-leasing events
and the amount of re-leasing costs. Our Investment Manager s review for impairment includes a consideration of the existence
of impairment indicators including third-party appraisals, published values for similar assets, recent transactions for similar
assets, adverse changes in market conditions for specific asset types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general
industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of the asset.  

Equipment
Notes and Loans Receivable   

Equipment
notes and loans receivable are reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance
net of any unamortized deferred fees, premiums or discounts on purchased notes and loans. Costs to originated notes, if any, are
reported as other assets in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unearned income, discounts and premiums, if any,
are amortized to interest income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest
rate method. Equipment notes and loans receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90
days past due. Additionally, we periodically review the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days.
Based upon the Investment Manager s judgment, accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status. Accounts on a non-accrual
status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and we believe recovery of the remaining
unpaid receivable is probable. Revenue on non-accrual accounts is recognized only when cash has been received.  

Results
of Operations for the three months ended September     30, 2016    

We
are currently in our Operating Period. The Offering Period ended on April 2, 2016. Through April 2, 2016, we admitted 1,508 Limited
Partners with total capital contributions of $74,965,064 resulting in the sale of 74,965.07 Units. We received cash contributions
of $72,504,327 and applied $2,460,737 which would have otherwise been paid as sales commission to the purchase of 2,460.74 additional
Units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid or accrued an underwriting fee to Securities totaling $1,949,907.  

We
have also entered our Operating Period, which is defined as the period in which we invest the net proceeds from the Offering Period
and reinvest cash from operations into business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets
with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams. During this period we anticipate substantial cash
outflows from investing activities as we acquire leased equipment. We also expect our operating activities to generate cash inflows
during this time as we collect rental payments from the leased assets we acquire.  

Our
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2015 is summarized as follows:   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we earned $81,115 in rental income from two operating leases of aircraft rotable parts
equipment. We also recognized $1,238,271 in interest income, the majority of which was generated by the equipment notes and collateralized
loans receivable. We recognized $312,950 in finance income from various finance leases. We also recognized an investment loss
of $32,393 from our equity method investments. We also recognized income of $3,793,359 from our equipment investment through SPV.
The increase in our total revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of the income from our equipment investment
through the Marine transaction which didn t occur until the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. There was no significant
change in rental income in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

Our
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 ( 2016 Quarter ) as compared to three months ended September
30, 2015 ( 2015 Quarter ) are summarized as follows:   

For
the three months ended September   30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $5,883,059 and $579,806 in total expenses, respectively.
There was no increase in management fees paid to our Investment Manager in 2016 as compared to 2015. We pay our Investment Manager
a management fee during the Operating Period and the Liquidation Period equal to the greater of, (i) 2.5% per annum of the aggregate
offering proceeds, or (ii) $125,000, payable monthly, until such time as an amount equal to at least 15% of our Limited Partners 
capital contributions have been returned to them, after which the monthly management fee will equal 100% of the management fee
as initially calculated above, less 1% for each additional 1% of the Partnership s Limited Partners  capital contributions
returned to them, such amounts to be measured on the last day of each month. We recognized $100,500 in depreciation and amortization
expense. We also incurred $33,706 in professional fees, which is consistent with prior year. In conjunction with the Marine and
the various Juliet transactions, we assumed approximately $17,104,000 and $17,378,000, respectively in loans payable with various
third parties which resulted in $875,297 in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We also incurred
expenses of $4,485,331 from our equipment investment through SPV. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2016 as compared
to 2015 is a result of the sale by Echo and Echo II of all their portfolios of leases and equipment notes to a third party in
June 2015.  

Net
Income    

As
a result of the factors discussed above, we reported a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $715,644,
prior to the allocation for non-controlling interest as compared to a net loss of $386,346 for the 2015 Quarter. The non-controlling
interest represents the 67.5% investment by SQN PAC in the Alpha transaction and the 10% investment by a third party in the CONT
Feeder transaction. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the non-controlling interest recognized net income of $407
due to its interest in Alpha and a net loss of $68,997 due to its interest in CONT Feeder.  

Results
of Operations for the nine months ended September     30, 2016    

Our
revenue for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 as compared to nine months ended September   30, 2015 is summarized
as follows:   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we earned $243,347 in rental income from two operating leases of aircraft rotable parts
equipment. We also recognized $2,971,449 in interest income, the majority of which was generated by the equipment notes and collateralized
loans receivable. We recognized $777,228 in finance income from various finance leases. We also recognized an investment loss
of $124,977 from our equity method investments. We also recognized income of $12,465,552 from our equipment investment through
SPV. The increase in our total revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily a result of the income from our equipment investment
through the Marine transaction which didn t occur until the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in our rental
income in 2016 compared to 2015 is a result of the sale by Echo and Echo II of all their portfolios of leases and equipment loan
receivables to a third party in June 2015.  

Our
expenses for the nine months ended September   30, 2016 ( 2016 Period ) as compared to nine months ended September
30, 2015 ( 2015 Period ) are summarized as follows:   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $17,497,026 and $3,867,433 in total expenses, respectively. There
was no increase in management fees paid to our Investment Manager in 2016 as compared to 2015. We pay our Investment Manager a
management fee during the Operating Period and the Liquidation Period equal to the greater of, (i) 2.5% per annum of the aggregate
offering proceeds, or (ii) $125,000, payable monthly, until such time as an amount equal to at least 15% of our Limited Partners 
capital contributions have been returned to them, after which the monthly management fee will equal 100% of the management fee
as initially calculated above, less 1% for each additional 1% of the Partnership s Limited Partners  capital contributions
returned to them, such amounts to be measured on the last day of each month. We recognized $315,968 in depreciation and amortization
expense. We also incurred $178,591 in professional fees, which is consistent with prior year. In conjunction with the Marine and
the various Juliet transactions, we assumed approximately $17,104,000 and $17,378,000, respectively in loans payable with various
third parties which resulted in $2,187,412 in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We also incurred
expenses of $13,325,166 from our equipment investment through SPV. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2016 as compared
to 2015 is a result of the sale by Echo and Echo II of all their portfolios of leases and equipment notes to a third party in
June 2015.  

Net
Income    

As
a result of the factors discussed above, we reported a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,988,963,
prior to the allocation for non-controlling interest as compared to a net loss of $1,317,708 for the 2015 Period. The non-controlling
interest represents the 67.5% investment by SQN PAC in the Alpha transaction and the 10% investment by a third party in the CONT
Feeder transaction. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the non-controlling interest recognized net income of $1,598
due to its interest in Alpha and a net loss of $85,961 due to its interest in CONT Feeder.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Sources
and Uses of Cash    

Sources
of Liquidity    

We
are currently in our Operating Period. The Offering Period ended on April 2, 2016. The Operating Period is the time frame in which
we acquire equipment under lease or enter into other equipment financing transactions. During this time period we anticipate that
a portion of our cash outflows will be for investing activities. We believe that the cash inflows will be sufficient to finance
our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including quarterly distributions to our limited partners, general and
administrative expenses, fees paid to our Investment Manager and new investment opportunities.  

Operating
Activities    

Cash
provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,402,509 and was primarily driven by the following
factors; (i) an increase in accrued interest receivable, (ii) an increase in accrued interest on loans payable from third parties
as part of the Marine and Just Loans transactions, (iii) an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and (iv) an increase
in minimum rents receivable for finance leases acquired during the period. Offsetting these fluctuations was a net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $1,989,000, a decrease in accrued interest income of approximately $1,774,000,
a decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $1,245,000, and a decrease in other assets of approximately $3,495,000.
We expect our accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate from period to period primarily due to the timing of payments
related to lease and financings transactions we will enter into. We anticipate that as we enter into additional equipment leasing
and financing transactions we will generate greater net cash inflows from operations principally from interest payments received
from equipment notes receivable and from rental payments received from lessees.  

Cash
provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4,922,703 and was primarily driven by the following
factors; (i) a decrease in other assets of approximately $4,527,000 due to a reclass to operating leases, (ii) an increase in
accrued interest receivable, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $1,561,000, (iv) investment loss from
equity method investments of approximately $487,000, (v) a net loss on sale of assets of approximately $57,000 and (vi) an increase
in minimum rents receivable for finance leases acquired during the period. Offsetting these fluctuations was a net loss of approximately
$1,317,000, a decrease in accrued interest on loans payable from an unrelated insurance company as loans payable were paid in
full due to the Echo and Echo II sales, as well as increases in finance accrued interest. We expect our accounts payable and accrued
expenses will fluctuate from period to period primarily due to the timing of payments related to lease and financings transactions
we will enter into. We anticipate that as we enter into additional equipment leasing and financing transactions we will generate
greater net cash inflows from operations principally from rental payments received from lessees.  

Investing
Activities    

Cash
used in investing activities was $29,762,342 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was related to our equipment investment
through SPV of approximately $2,717,000. We paid approximately $2,730,000 for purchases of finance leases. We received
approximately $80,000 from our investment in Informage SQN Technologies. We paid approximately $10,243,000 for our collateralized
loans receivable. We received approximately $1,163,000 from our collateralized loans receivable. We also paid approximately $22,294,000
for the acquisition of equipment notes receivable. The borrowers repaid approximately $1,636,000 during the period.  

Cash
used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4,792,367. We received payments from borrowers
related to our equipment loans receivable of approximately $1,129,000. We received proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately
$15,432,000 primarily due to the Echo and Echo II sales. We paid approximately $1,465,000 for an investment in SQN Helo and also
paid approximately $6,818,000 for an investment in H P. We paid approximately $103,000 for our investment in Informage SQN
Technologies and received proceeds of approximately $610,000 from our investment in Informage SQN Technologies. We also paid approximately
$745,000 for the purchase of a residual value interest in equipment subject to operating leases. We made advances on collateralized
loan receivables of approximately $10,965,000 and the borrowers repaid approximately $150,000 during the period. We also paid
approximately $1,023,000 for the purchase of finance leases. We also paid approximately $1,217,000 for the acquisition of equipment
notes receivable. The borrowers repaid approximately $288,000 during the period.  

Financing
Activities    

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $26,423,607 and was primarily due to cash proceeds
received of approximately $19,147,000 from the sale of our Units to investors and cash received from loan payable of approximately
$16,926,000. Offsetting this increase were principal payments of approximately $2,808,000 on loans with underwriting fees, organizational
and offering costs of approximately $1,549,000 and payments for distributions totaling approximately $5,235,000.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $270,497 and was primarily due to cash proceeds
received of approximately $17,950,000 for the sale of our Units to investors and cash proceeds received of approximately $1,789,000
from non-controlling interest contribution. Offsetting this increase were payments of approximately $11,305,000 for payment in
full of loans payable due to the Echo and Echo II sales, $2,460,000 for equipment loans with various financial institutions in
relation to the Echo and Echo II portfolios, underwriting fees, organizational and offering costs of approximately $1,928,000,
payments for distributions to our limited partners totaling approximately $2,500,000 and payments for distributions to the non-controlling
interest totaling approximately $1,075,000.  

Distributions    

During
our Operating Period, we intend to pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis to our Limited Partners at 1.625% per quarter,
the equivalent rate of 6.5% per annum, of each Limited Partners  capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission
for each Limited Partner). The amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we made quarterly distributions to our Limited Partners, at a rate of 2% per quarter, the equivalent
per annum rate of 8.0% totaling $4,221,320. We did not make a cash distribution to the General Partner during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016; however, we accrued $42,213 for distributions due to the General Partner which resulted in a Distributions
payable to General Partner of $70,073 at September 30, 2016.  

Commitments
and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions    

Commitment
and Contingencies   

Our
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99% to our Limited Partners and 1% to our General Partner until the Limited Partners
have received total distributions equal to each Limited Partners  capital contribution plus an 8%, compounded annually,
cumulative return on each Limited Partners  capital contribution. After such time, income, losses and distributions will
be allocated 80% to our Limited Partners and 20% to our General Partner.  

We
enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known.  

In
the normal course of business, we enter into contracts of various types, including lease contracts, contracts for the sale or
purchase of lease assets, and management contracts. It is prevalent industry practice for most contracts of any significant value
to include provisions that each of the contracting parties, in addition to assuming liability for breaches of the representations,
warranties, and covenants that are part of the underlying contractual obligations, to also assume an obligation to indemnify and
hold the other contractual party harmless for such breaches, and for harm caused by such party s gross negligence and willful
misconduct, including, in certain instances, certain costs and expenses arising from the contract. Generally, to the extent these
contracts are performed in the ordinary course of business under the reasonable business judgment of our General Partner and our
Investment Manager, no liability will arise as a result of these provisions. Should any such indemnification obligation become
payable, we would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Transactions   

None.  

Contractual
Obligations   

During
our Operating Period, we pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis to our Limited Partners at 1.625% per quarter, of each Limited
Partners  capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner). The amount and rate of cash
distributions could vary and are not guaranteed.  

Subsequent
Events    

On
October 4, 2016, the Partnership funded an additional $854,390 to the company procuring equipment leasing deals in Mexico. The
loan accrues interest at rate of 10% per annum and is secured by the equipment procured in the leasing deals.  

On
October 14, 2016, Juliet received cash of $2,008,556 ($2,000,000 of principal and $8,556 of interest) as payment in full of a
promissory note.  

On
October 24, 2016, the die board cutting equipment lease commenced. The lease requires 60 monthly payments of $6,329 beginning
on October 24, 2016.  

On November 2, 2016 and on November 9, 2016, the Partnership funded a total of $1,174,560, after applicable
exchange rates, toward the installment purchase of four combined heat and power units ( CHPs ) under Loan Note Instruments,
to provide additional financing of the Facility which acquired shares of the SPE that previously acquired, by assignment, the rights
to lease a parcel of land in Ireland on which planning permissions have been granted to construct an aerobic digestion plant. This
is part of a project financing and long term lease of the aerobic digestion plant which includes the CHP s.

4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our General Partner
and Investment Manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our General
Partner and Investment Manager, including its Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
concluded that our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

In
designing and evaluating our General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures, our General
Partner and Investment Manager recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our
General Partner s and Investment Manager s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable
assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations
in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override
of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated
future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with
established policies or procedures.  

Evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting   

Our
General Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of condensed
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Partnership; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Partnership
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Partnership; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s
assets that could have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Our
General Partner and our Investment Manager have assessed the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in  Internal Control Integrated Framework.   

Based
on their assessment, our General Partner and our Investment Manager believe that, as of September 30, 2016, its internal control
over financial reporting is effective.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting   

There
were no additional material changes in our General Partner s or our Investment Manager s internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
their internal control over financial reporting.
