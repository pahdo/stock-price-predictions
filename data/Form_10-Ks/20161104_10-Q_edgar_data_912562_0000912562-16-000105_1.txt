  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of results for the interim period have been included. The results of operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. The Company is subject to reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as colder, inclement weather reduces order rates from end markets it serves. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Immaterial Adjustments to Previously Reported Interim Periods 
    
  In preparing its consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified certain adjustments during the implementation and subsequent testing of internal controls over financial reporting, including internal controls over revenue recognition for the acquired company that closed in 2015.  The Company determined that these identified adjustments should be made to previously reported interim periods within the Company's Renewable Energy and Conservation segment. These adjustments are a result of deficiencies and errors in the Company's accounting for estimated total contract costs at completion as it is related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion accounting method. Specifically, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company identified cost savings from margin improvement initiatives which included raw material sourcing, freight management, and strategic make versus buy decisions.  These costs savings were incurred sooner than expected. They should have been reflected in the total estimated contract costs at completion for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, which resulted in an understatement of revenue recorded for these respective quarters. 
    
  In accordance with ASC Topic 250,   Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,   and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99,   Materiality,   the Company assessed these adjustments and determined that they were immaterial to each of the reporting periods affected and, therefore, amendment of previously filed reports was not required.  However, the cumulative effect  of correcting these errors would have been material to the results of our operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Therefore, in order to provide consistency in the consolidated financial statements, adjustments for these immaterial amounts to previously reported interim period amounts are reflected in the financial information herein, and will be reflected in future filings containing such financial information. 
    
  In accordance with ASC Topic 250, the effect of the correction on each financial statement line item, income from continuing operations, net income and related per-share amounts for each prior interim periods of the current fiscal year is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

There were no adjustments made to retained earnings at the beginning of 2016 as the effects of the adjusted amounts were to interim periods during the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 

2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." The update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. More specifically, the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of Topic 606 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).  ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU 2016-10 clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients." ASU 2016-12 reduces the potential for diversity among initial application, as well as, the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 at transition and on an ongoing basis. These ASUs apply to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. These ASUs are effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities have the choice to apply these ASUs either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying these standards at the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We are currently evaluating the requirements of these standards and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330)."  The amendments to this Update were issued to change the measurement of inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, may be applied prospectively and early adopted for the beginning of an interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard which is not expected to have a material impact on our Balance Sheet or Statements of Operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-02 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting.   ASU 2016-11 rescinds certain SEC Staff Observer comments codified in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas.  ASU 2016-11 is effective upon adoption of Topic 606.  We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-11 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues to reduce diversity in reporting. This Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2016-15 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements.

10. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
  On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the Company authorized the Gibraltar Industries, Inc. 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("Non-Employee Directors Plan").  The Non-Employee Directors Plan is a compensation plan that allows the Company to grant awards of shares of the Company's common stock to non-employee Directors of the Company.  In connection with the Non-Employee Directors Plan, the Company adopted a new stock deferral plan, the Gibraltar Industries, Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Deferral Plan ("Deferral Plan"). The Deferral Plan permits non-employee Directors of the Company to defer receipt of shares of common stock which the non-employee Director is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the Non-Employee Directors Plan. 
  On May 7, 2015, the shareholders of the Company authorized the Gibraltar Industries, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and simultaneously amended the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan") to terminate issuance of further awards from the Prior Plan.  The Plan is an incentive compensation plan that allows the Company to grant equity-based incentive compensation awards to eligible participants. Awards under the Plan may be in the form of options, restricted shares, restricted units, performance shares, performance stock units, and rights.  
  Equity Based Awards - Settled in Stock 
  The following table provides the number of stock unit awards granted which will convert to shares upon vesting as well as restricted shares issued during the   nine   months ended   September 30,   along with the weighted average grant date fair values:  

Performance Stock Units - Settled in Cash 
  The Company has also awarded performance stock units ("PSUs") that will convert to cash after   three   years based upon the   one   year performance period.  The cost of these awards is recognized over the requisite vesting period.  The PSUs earned over the performance period are determined based on the Company s actual return on invested capital (ROIC) relative to the ROIC targeted for the performance period.  
  The following table provides the number of PSUs which will convert to cash:

    The final number of PSUs earned will be determined based upon actual performance at the end of 2016, with any amounts due to participants payable in January 2019. 
      During the 2013 performance period, the participants earned an aggregate of   114,000   PSUs, representing   50%   of the targeted award of   237,000   units. In January 2016,    $2,723,000   was paid to the participants for the 2013 PSUs based on the trailing   90  -day closing price of the Company's common stock ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  No PSU awards were earned during the 2014 performance period.  
  The following table summarizes the compensation expense recognized for the PSUs which will convert to cash for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

Management Stock Purchase Plan 
  The Management Stock Purchase Plan ("MSPP") provides participants the ability to defer a portion of their compensation or Directors  fees, which deferral is converted to restricted stock units, and credited to an account.  Under the MSPP, the Company provides a matching award in restricted stock units equal to a percentage of the employees' compensation or Directors' 2015 fee deferral amount.  Beginning January 1, 2016, Directors do not receive any company-matching on deferred fees. The account represents a share-based liability converted to and settled in cash which is payable to participants upon retirement or a termination of their service to the Company.   
  The following table provides the number of restricted stock units credited to participant accounts and the payments made with respect to restricted stock units issued under the MSPP during the   nine   months ended   September 30,    

11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The primary risks that the Company manages through its derivative instruments from time to time are foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity pricing risk. We enter into derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions to minimize counterparty credit risk. Depending on the type of transaction, we may enter into either derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and/or derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not currently hold any derivatives classified as hedging instruments and qualifying for hedge accounting.   
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, various techniques and assumptions can be used to estimate fair value.  A financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as follows: 
             
    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities. 
                
    Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
     The Company's derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market data, such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates and implied volatility. In addition, the Company received fair value estimates from contract counterparties to verify the reasonableness of the Company's estimates. These derivatives are classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.  
  The following table presents the fair values and classification of our financial assets (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis, all of which are classified as Level 2 (in thousands):

The Company s only other financial instrument for which the carrying value differs from its fair value is long-term debt. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of outstanding debt net of unamortized debt issuance costs was   $221,410,000   and   $217,925,000  , respectively, compared to its carrying value of   $209,441,000   and   $209,282,000  , respectively.  The fair value of the Company s Senior Subordinated   6.25%   Notes is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and was estimated based on quoted market prices adjusted for unamortized debt issuance costs.   

13. DIVESTITURE 
  In connection with the Company's strategy to drive transformational change in its portfolio and financial results, management continually evaluates all aspects of our current portfolio for future profitable growth and greater shareholder returns.  As a result of this strategy, the Company sold its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party for cash of   $9.1 million   (  $8.3 million   proceeds, net of transaction costs of   $0.8 million  ) on April 15, 2016. The sale of this business resulted in a loss before taxes of   $8.8 million   which is presented within other expense (income) in the consolidated Statement of Operations.  As noted in the Income Taxes footnote, the Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of   $11.5 million   related to the sale, resulting  
  
   17 

Table of Contents  

in an after tax gain on sale of   $2.7 million  .  This divestiture does not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation as it does not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations.  Therefore, prior period results of continuing operations have not been restated to exclude the impact of the divested business's financial results.  This business, which supplied expanded metal product for filtration, security perimeters and other applications, contributed   $36 million   in revenue to the Company's Industrial   Infrastructure Products segment for full year 2015 and had nearly break-even operating results.  

14. EXIT ACTIVITY COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 
  The Company s business strategy has been formulated to effect a transformation of its operations and improve financial results over a   five   year period.  In 2015, the first year of this planned transformation, an 80/20 simplification initiative commenced across many of our business units.  This on-going initiative, in part, focuses the Company s internal resources on further increasing the value provided to our customers.   
  A result of this initiative was the identification of low-volume, internally-produced products which have been or will be outsourced or discontinued. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , charges resulted from this identification which relate to the write-down of inventory and impairment of machinery and equipment associated with either discontinued product lines or the reduction of manufactured goods offered within a product line.  These assets were written down to their sale or scrap value, and were subsequently sold or disposed of.  Exit activity costs were also incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which relate to contract termination costs, severance costs, and other moving and closing costs.  These costs were the result of the closing and consolidation of facilities, relocation of inventory and equipment at those facilities and the reduction of workforce associated with the discontinued products and closed facilities.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company closed   three   facilities and eliminated   three   product lines which resulted in asset impairment charges.  In addition, the Company sold and leased back a fourth facility, which resulted in a gain. 
  The following tables set forth the asset impairment charges, exit activity costs and gain on facilities sold in conjunction with these efforts, incurred by segment during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   related to the restructuring activities described above (in thousands): 

The following table provides a summary of where the asset impairments and exit activity costs (gains) were recorded in the statement of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands):

15. INCOME TAXES 
  The following table summarizes the provision for income taxes for continuing operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   and the applicable effective tax rates (in thousands): 

The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to state taxes and unfavorable discrete items. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was less than the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to deductible permanent differences and favorable discrete items offset by state taxes. The aforementioned favorable discrete items were primarily comprised of the   $11.5 million   benefit recorded by the Company related to the worthless stock deduction and an associated bad debt deduction of inter-company debt resulting from the sale of its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party.  
  The effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   due to state taxes partially offset by favorable permanent differences and favorable discrete items. 

16. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands):

17. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company is organized into   three   reportable segments on the basis of the production process and products and services provided by each segment, identified as follows: 
           (i) 
    Residential Products, which primarily includes roof and foundation ventilation products, mail and package storage products, rain dispersion products and roofing accessories;  
              (ii) 
    Industrial and Infrastructure Products, which primarily includes fabricated bar grating, expanded and perforated metal, plus bridge-related expansion joints and structural bearings; and 
              (iii) 
    Renewable Energy and Conservation, which primarily includes designing, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems and commercial-scale greenhouse structures. 
     In determining the reportable segments, the Company aggregated operating segments based on their similar economic and operating characteristics.  
  The following table sets forth the reconciliation of sales to earnings before income taxes by segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

18. SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
  On October 11, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nexus Corporation (Nexus) for   $25,000,000  , subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments provided for in the stock purchase agreement. Nexus is a leading provider of commercial-scale greenhouses to customers in the United States. The acquisition of Nexus was financed through cash on hand. The results of operation of Nexus will be included within the Renewable Energy and Conservation segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

  Overview  
  Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and distributor of building products for industrial, transportation infrastructure, residential housing, renewable energy and resource conservation markets. Beginning in mid-2014, at the direction of new executive leadership, the Company began a re-examination of its operations, competitive advantages, and strategies, all focused on re-setting a business strategy that would significantly elevate and accelerate the growth and financial returns of the Company.  The new strategy, completed in late 2014, is targeted at delivering best-in-class, sustainable value creation for our shareholders for the long-term. This strategy is intended to drive a transformational change in the Company s portfolio and its financial results. It has four key elements which are: operational excellence, product innovation, portfolio management, and acquisitions as a strategic accelerator.   
    
  Operational excellence is our first pillar in this strategy.  80/20 simplification ("80/20") is core to this part of the strategy which is based on the analysis that 25% of the customers typically generate 89% of the revenue in a business, and 150% of the profitability.  Through the application of data analysis generated by 80/20 practice, we are focusing on our largest and best opportunities (the  80 ) and eliminating complexity associated with less profitable opportunities (the  20 ) in order to generate more earnings year over year, at a higher rate of return with a more efficient use of capital.  
    
  We started the multi-year simplification initiative in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a comprehensive data analysis and we are still in the early stages of implementation. We believe that over the first three years, we will drive 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement from the 80/20 process with corresponding benefits from the resulting reduction of operational assets. 
  Product innovation is our second strategic pillar. Innovation is centered on the allocation of new and existing resources to opportunities that drive sustainable returns. We are focused on those products and technologies that have relevance to the end-user and can be differentiated from our competition.  Our focus on innovation is centered on four markets: postal and parcel products, residential air management, infrastructure and renewable energy.  These respective markets are expected to grow based on demand for centralized mail and parcel delivery systems and zero carbon footprint homes; the need for repairs to elevated bridges that are deficient or functionally obsolete; and energy sources not dependent on fossil fuels.  
  The third pillar of our strategy is portfolio management, which is a natural adjunct to the 80/20 initiative. Using the 80/20 process, we continually evaluate all aspects of our current portfolio for future profitable growth and greater shareholder return which will lead to consideration of any necessary refinements.  The sale of our European industrial manufacturing business on April, 15, 2016, was a direct result of our evaluation of this third pillar.  
  
   34 

Table of Contents  

The fourth pillar of our strategy is acquisitions.  We are focused on making strategic acquisitions in five key markets, four of which are served by existing platforms within the Company. The existing platforms include the same areas in which we are targeting the development of innovative products:  postal and parcel solutions, infrastructure, residential air management and renewable energy.  The remaining new platform is water management and conservation.  What these platforms have in common is that they are all large markets in which the underlying trends for customer convenience and safety, energy-savings and resource conservation are of increasing importance and are expected to drive long-term demand. These markets also offer the opportunity for higher returns on our investments than those we have generated in the past. The acquisitions of Rough Brothers Manufacturing, Inc., RBI Solar, Inc., and affiliates, collectively known as "RBI" in June 2015 and more recently, the Nexus Corporation on October 11, 2016 were the direct result of this fourth pillar. 
  On June 9, 2015, the Company acquired RBI for approximately   $148 million  . RBI is one of the largest manufacturers of commercial greenhouses in North America and has also established itself among North America s fastest-growing providers of solar racking solutions. RBI designs and manufactures greenhouses for commercial, institutional and retail customers.  In solar racking, RBI is a full service provider that engineers, manufactures and installs solar racking systems for utilities and solar park developers.  RBI also sells solar racking for residential rooftops. The acquisition of RBI has enabled the Company to leverage its expertise in structural metals manufacturing and materials sourcing to help meet the fast-growing global demand for solar racking solutions. The results of RBI have been included in the Company s consolidated financial results since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  
    
  On October 11, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nexus Corporation (Nexus) for $25 million subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments provided for in the stock purchase agreement. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand. Nexus is a leading provider of commercial-scale greenhouses to customers in the United States and is expected to generate revenues of $30 million in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The results of operation of Nexus will be included within the Renewable Energy and Conservation segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
    
  On April 15, 2016, the Company sold its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party for cash of $9.3 million. This business, which supplied expanded metal products for filtration, security perimeters and other applications, contributed $36 million in revenue to the Company's Industrial   Infrastructure Products segment in 2015 and had nearly break-even operating results.  The divestiture of this business is in alignment with the Company's portfolio management strategy.  
    
  The Company serves customers primarily throughout North America, and to a lesser extent, Europe and Asia. Our customers include major home improvement retailers, wholesalers, industrial distributors, contractors, solar developers and institutional and commercial growers of plants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated 43 facilities in 17 states, Canada, Germany, China, and Japan giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service and quality to a number of regional and national customers and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the European and Asian markets. 
  The Company operates and reports its results in the following three reporting segments, entitled  Residential Products ,  Industrial and Infrastructure Products  and "Renewable Energy and Conservation".  
  Our Residential Products segment focuses on new residential housing construction and residential repair and remodeling activity with products including roof and foundation ventilation products, mail and package storage products, rain dispersion products and roof ventilation accessories. This segment's products are sold through major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, buying groups, roofing distributors, and residential contractors. 
  Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment focuses on a variety of markets including discrete and process manufacturing, highway and bridge construction, and energy and power generation markets with products including fabricated bar grating for industrial flooring, expanded and perforated metal, as well as, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges. This segment distributes its products through industrial, commercial and transportation contractors, industrial distributors and original equipment manufacturers. 
  Our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment focuses on the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems and commercial-sale greenhouse structures. This segment's services and products are provided directly to end users and through product distribution channels. 
  The end markets our segments serve, which consist of residential housing, industrial manufacturing, transportation infrastructure, and renewable energy and conservation, are subject to economic conditions that are influenced by various factors. These factors include but are not limited to changes in general economic conditions, interest rates, exchange rates,  
  
   35 

Table of Contents  

credit availability, commodity costs, demand for residential construction, governmental policies and funding, tax policies and the level of non-residential construction and infrastructure projects. As a result of the Company's re-examination of its operations and re-setting of its business strategy noted above, we believe we are prepared to respond timely to changes in these factors. We have and expect to continue to restructure our operations, including consolidation of facilities, reducing overhead costs, curtailing investments in inventory, and managing our business to generate incremental cash. Additionally, we believe our four-pillar strategy described above has enabled us to better react to fluctuations in commodity costs and customer demand, and has helped in improving margins. We have used the improved cash flows generated by these initiatives to maintain low levels of debt, improve our liquidity position, and invest in growth initiatives. Overall, we are striving to achieve stronger financial results, make more efficient use of  capital, and deliver higher shareholder returns. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015     
  The following table sets forth selected data from our statements of operations and the related percentage of net sales for the three months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

The following table sets forth the Company s net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

Consolidated net sales   decreased   by   $32.3 million  , or   10.6%  , to   $272.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a 8.7% decrease in volume in our Residential Products and Industrial   Infrastructure segments, along with the effects of the divestiture of our European industrial manufacturing business in April 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations and a combined 0.3% increase in pricing to customers.  
  Net sales in our Residential Products segment   decreased     7.1%  , or   $9.0 million   to   $118.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $127.0 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was a result of a 10.8% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2.0% increase in pricing to customers and foreign currency fluctuations which contributed an increase of $2.0 million to net sales.  The net sales volume decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand  
  
   36 

for our postal and parcel storage products, reflecting the completion of a contract for cluster mailboxes at the end of 2015, along with a modest decrease in demand for our roofing-related ventilation and rain dispersion products. 
  Net sales in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment   decreased     24.5%  , or $  23.6 million   to $  72.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  96.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in net sales was the combined result of the divestiture of our European industrial manufacturing business affecting 9.4% of sales, lower shipment volume of 13.6%, and a 1.7% decrease in pricing to customers, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  This segment's volume was primarily impacted by lower demand for our industrial products from domestic energy-related end markets, that have been affected by reduced oil and other commodities prices.  
  Net sales in our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment were essentially unchanged from the comparable time period last year.  The third quarter 2015 benefited from increased sales activity as developers pushed to complete new solar installations to qualify for the federal investment tax credit of 30%. However, for the current quarter, our newest segment continues to perform as expected. While we have been more selective with the projects pursued to date in 2016 which align with our operational excellence initiatives, our back log of jobs scheduled for installation and incoming order rates are higher at   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior year quarter. 
  Our consolidated gross margin increased to   24.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   20.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Within our Residential Products segment, both gross profit and gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to the prior year quarter. This segment benefited from operational efficiencies, an improved alignment of material costs to customer selling prices and contributions from our 80/20 initiatives to simplify our business processes and product lines. Favorable currency fluctuations also contributed to the margin increase.  Decreased volume from our postal products partially offset these increases.   
  In our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment, both gross profit and gross margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased as compared to the prior year quarter largely a result of  lower volumes in industrial products, a decrease in pricing offered to customers and the disposition of our European industrial manufacturing business.  The margin decrease was partially offset by  manufacturing efficiencies, our company-wide 80/20 initiatives and better alignment of material costs to customer selling prices.   
  Both gross profit and gross margin, as a percentage of sales, in our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment increased compared to the prior year quarter. The increase results from the execution of operational efficiencies in the segment, including rising synergies from raw material sourcing, freight management, and strategic make-versus-buy decisions.   
  Selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses   increased   by $  3.5 million  , or   9.2%  , to $  41.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  38.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $  3.5 million   increase was primarily due to an increase in performance-based compensation expense, the result of two key performance metrics. One metric is improved operating results which is measured by the Company's increased earnings per share and return on invested capital year over year.  The other metric is the higher price of the Company's shares which increased as compared to the third quarter of 2015. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to   15.2%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   12.4%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The following table sets forth the Company s income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

37 

Our Residential Products segment generated an operating margin of   16.5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   12.5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase of   $3.5 million   of operating profit is due to the benefits of improved operational efficiencies and contributions from the 80/20 simplification initiative, along with favorable effects of currency fluctuations of   $2.0 million  .  Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of lower sales volumes primarily from postal products during the current year quarter.  
    
  Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment generated an operating margin of   2.6%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   8.4%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was largely a result of lower shipment volumes in industrial products, and a decrease in pricing offered to customers.  The margin decrease was partially offset by the benefits from improved management of raw material costs along with effects of manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the 80/20 simplification. 
    
  The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment generated an operating margin of   20.0%   in the current year quarter  compared to   6.1%   in the prior year quarter. The increase results from the execution of operational efficiencies in the segment, including rising synergies from raw material sourcing, freight management, and strategic make-versus-buy decisions.   
  Unallocated corporate expenses   increased   $  5.7 million   from $  5.6 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to $  11.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase was due, in part. to a $3.2 million increase in performance-based compensation expense, the result of two key performance metrics. One metric is improved operating results which is measured by the Company's increased earnings per share and return on invested capital year over year.  The other metric is the higher price of the Company's shares which increased as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Senior leadership and management transition costs of $1.5 million recorded during the third quarter of 2016 also contributed to the increase over the comparable period for 2015.  
  Other income, net of other expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was negligible.  The Company recorded other income of   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The prior year non-operating income was primarily comprised of net gains on derivative contracts for hedges on foreign currencies and select raw materials related to transactions with our Residential Products segment, offset by foreign currency fluctuations. 
  Interest expense decreased by   $0.3 million   to   $3.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The three months ended   September 30, 2015   included interest expense relating to funds borrowed on the revolving credit facility in June 2015 to help finance the acquisition of RBI.  No amounts were outstanding on our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We recognized a provision for income taxes of $  9.0 million   and $  7.7 million  , with effective tax rates of   39.4%   and   36.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively.  The effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to state taxes and unfavorable discrete items.  The effective tax rate for the    third   quarter of   2015   exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to state taxes partially offset by favorable permanent differences and favorable discrete items.

Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth selected data from our statements of operations and the related percentage of net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

The following table sets forth the Company s net sales by reportable segment, for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

Consolidated net sales   increased   by   $17.4 million  , or   2.3%  , to   $776.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily the result of incremental sales generated from our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, which contains the results of RBI acquired in June 2015. Favorable foreign currency fluctuations of   $3.7 million   also contributed to the increase.  These increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our European industrial manufacturing business in April 2016 resulting in a reduction in sales of $18.4 million, along with a combined 8.0% decrease in volume and a combined 1.0% decrease in pricing to customers in both our Residential Products and Industrial   Infrastructure segments.  
  Net sales in our Residential Products segment   decreased     8.3%  , or   $30.4 million   to   $338.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to last year. The decrease was primarily the result of a $40.2 million, or 10.9%, decline in volume for our postal and parcel storage products related to the completion of a contract for cluster mailboxes at the end of 2015.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume of 0.4% for our other residential product offerings along with foreign currency fluctuations which contributed an increase of   $5.5 million   to net sales.  
  Net sales in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment   decreased     20.0%  , or   $58.2 million   to   $233.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   The decrease in net sales was the combined result of the divestiture of our European industrial manufacturing business which previously contributed 6.3% of sales, lower shipment volume of 9.9%, and a 3.6% decrease in pricing to customers, as compared to the same period in 2015.  This segment was primarily impacted by lower demand for our industrial products from domestic energy-related end markets, that have been depressed by reduced oil and other commodities prices.  
  
   39 

Net sales in our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment increased 107.3 %, or   $105.9 million   to   $204.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in 2016 was due to the benefit of incremental sales compared to the prior year period in which RBI was acquired in June 2015.    
  Our consolidated gross margin increased to   24.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   17.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our consolidated gross profit also increased for the comparable period. 
  Within our Residential Products segment, both gross profit and gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to the prior year period, despite decreased volume from our postal products.  This segment benefited from operational efficiencies, an improved alignment of material costs to customer selling prices and contributions from our 80/20 initiatives to simplify our business processes and product lines.  Favorable currency fluctuations, as compared to the same period in the prior year also contributed to the margin increase.  
  In our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment, while gross profit decreased, gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to the prior year quarter.   The profit decrease was due to a decrease in sales volumes in industrial products, the effects of the disposition of our European industrial manufacturing business, decrease in pricing offered to customers. along with currency fluctuations.  The margin increase was largely the result of manufacturing efficiencies, our 80/20 initiatives and a favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices.   
  Both gross profit and gross margin, as a percentage of sales, in our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment increased compared to the prior year quarter. The increase largely results from the benefit of incremental revenues earned in the current year as compared to the prior year in which RBI was acquired in June 2015.  The execution of operational efficiencies in the segment, including rising synergies from raw material sourcing, freight management, and strategic make-versus-buy decisions also contributed to the increase in margin. 
  SG A expenses   increased   by   $26.6 million  , or   29.0%  , to   $118.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $91.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $26.6 million   increase was largely the result of $15.8 million of incremental SG A expense recorded year over year at RBI, acquired in June 2015, $8.8 million of higher performance-based compensation costs, along with the benefit of a $6.8 million gain on the sale leaseback of one of our facilities recorded during 2015. These increases were partially offset by acquisition related costs of $4.5 million recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The higher performance-based compensation costs are the result of two key performance metrics. One metric is improved operating results which is measured by the Company's increased earnings per share and return on invested capital year over year.  The other metric is the higher price of the Company's shares which increased as compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses increased to   15.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   12.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The following table sets forth the Company s income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of net sales by reportable segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

Our Residential Products segment generated an operating margin of   15.5%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   10.8%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Apart from the impact of the $6.8 million gain on the sale leaseback of a facility during the first quarter of 2015, the increase to its income from operations of $5.6 million was largely due to the benefits of improved operational efficiencies and contributions from the 80/20 simplification initiative, along with the effects of  currency fluctuations as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  These benefits were partially offset by lower sales volumes primarily for postal products.   
  
   40 

Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment operating margin decreased to   4.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period of   5.3%  .  Decreased sales volume resulted in the margin decline, partially offset by favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices along with benefits from cost reductions compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment generated an operating margin of   17.1%   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   6.1%    in the comparable prior year period. The increase was largely due to the benefit of incremental revenues for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period in which RBI was acquired in June of 2015. The execution of operational efficiencies in the segment, including rising synergies from raw material sourcing, freight management, and strategic make-versus-buy decisions also contributed to the increase in margin for the current year.  
  Unallocated corporate expenses increased   $8.6 million   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $8.2 million in performance based compensation expense, the result of two key performance metrics. One metric is improved operating results which is measured by the Company's increased earnings per share and return on invested capital year over year.  The other metric is the higher price of the Company's shares which increased as compared to 2015. 
  Other expense of   $7.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    is primarily comprised of the $8.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of our European industrial manufacturing business, slightly offset by foreign currency translation gains. Other income of   $4.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is primarily comprised of net gains on derivative contracts for hedges on foreign currencies and select raw materials related to transactions with our Residential Products segment, offset by foreign currency translation translation losses.  
  Interest expense decreased by   $0.4 million   to   $11.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $11.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility to help finance the acquisition of RBI in June 2015. These borrowings were repaid prior to the end of 2015. 
  We recognized a provision for income taxes of   $12.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and an effective tax rate of   22.7%  , compared with a provision for income taxes of   $13.2 million   and an effective tax rate of   36.1%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was less than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to deductible permanent differences and favorable discrete items partially offset by state taxes.  The aforementioned favorable discrete items were primarily comprised of the $11.5 million benefit recorded by the Company related to the worthless stock deduction and the associated bad debt deduction of inter-company debt resulting from the sale of its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party.  The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   exceeded the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to state taxes, partially offset by favorable permanent differences and favorable discrete items.   
   
  Outlook 
    
  We expect 2016 consolidated revenues in the range of $1.00 billion to $1.01 billion, a decrease of approximately 3 percent compared with $1.04 billion in 2015. This revenue outlook takes into account nearly $100 million of 2015 revenues not repeating in 2016.  This $100 million of sales included the Company s divestiture in April 2016 of its European industrial business that contributed $36 million in revenues with nearly break-even operating results to the Industrial   Infrastructure Products segment in 2015; $50 million of sales related to the completed contract in December 2015 for centralized mailboxes; and discontinued products under the 80/20 simplification initiative. Continued anticipated softness in the end markets that our Industrial   Infrastructure Products segment serves, resulting from the effect of lower oil and gas prices, contributes to the decline year over year.  
  We expect higher after-tax earnings for full year 2016 due to the success of our operational excellence and 80/20 initiatives.  Diluted earnings per share for 2016 are expected in the range of $1.43 to $1.48, compared with $0.74 per diluted share in 2015.  This range includes the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the European industrial business of $0.09 per share and the impact of restructuring charges of $0.23 per share, which reflects additional restructuring costs for new initiatives affecting the fourth quarter of 2016.

Concerning profitability, we believe the continued efficiencies in both the Renewable Energy and Conservation and the Residential Products segments will largely offset the end-market softness that we expect to impact our Industrial and Infrastructure segment through the fourth quarter. We continue to develop acquisition opportunities as well as pursue inorganic opportunities to accelerate growth in the front half of 2017.  We remain on track to achieve our key financial objectives for 2016:  increasing year-over-year earnings, at a higher rate of return on revenues, and making more efficient use of our capital than we did in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  Our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations with working capital, to purchase capital improvements for our business and facilities, and to fund acquisitions. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities as appropriate while focusing on working capital efficiency and profit improvement opportunities to minimize the cash invested to operate our business.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our liquidity of $  460.5 million   consisted of $  173.1 million   of cash plus   $287.5 million   of availability under our revolving credit facility. We believe this liquidity, together with the cash expected to be generated from operations, should be sufficient to fund working capital needs and simplification initiatives that likely will need cash to fund transitions and future growth. We continue to search for strategic acquisitions and a larger acquisition may require additional borrowings and/or the issuance of our common stock. 
  Our Senior Credit Agreement provides the Company with liquidity and capital resources for use by our U.S. operations. Historically, our foreign operations have generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and fund their capital improvements. As of   September 30, 2016  , our foreign subsidiaries held $23.3 million of cash in U.S. dollars. We believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet future obligations and allows the foreign business units to reinvest in their operations. These cash resources could eventually be used to grow our business internationally.  Repatriation of this cash for domestic purposes could result in significant tax consequences. 
  Over the long-term, we expect that future obligations, including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions, may be financed through a number of sources, including internally available cash, availability under our revolving credit facility, new debt financing, the issuance of equity securities, or any combination of the above. Any potential acquisitions are evaluated based on our acquisition strategy, which includes the enhancement of our existing products, operations, or capabilities, expanding our access to new products, markets, and customers, and the improvement of shareholder value.  Our recent acquisition of Nexus on October 11, 2016 was financed through cash on hand. Our 2015 acquisition of RBI was funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.  These borrowings were repaid prior to the end of 2015. 
  These expectations are forward-looking statements based upon currently available information and may change if conditions in the credit and equity markets deteriorate or other circumstances change. To the extent that operating cash flows are lower than current levels, or sources of financing are not available or not available at acceptable terms, our future liquidity may be adversely affected. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth selected cash flow data for the   nine   months ended   September 30,   (in thousands): 

42 

Table of Contents  

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated net cash from operating activities totaling $  101.2 million  , composed of net income from continuing operations of $41.4 million plus $34.8 million from non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, loss on sale of a business and net gain on sales of assets, along with a decrease in working capital of $25.0 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $44.5 million, primarily composed of net income from continuing operations of $23.2  million plus non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, gain on sale of assets, and stock compensation of $20.1 million and $1.2 million of cash provided by working capital. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the cash provided by working capital and other net assets of $25.0 million included $9.7 million and $3.8 million decreases in inventory and accounts receivables, respectively, an $11.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities, and a $2.4 million increase in accounts payable, offset by a $1.9 million increase in other current assets and other assets. The decrease in inventory is due to the Company's 80/20 simplification process, which has resulted in the discontinuation of less profitable product lines and the corresponding disposal of inventory associated with those product lines.  The decrease in accounts receivable, which includes costs in excess of billings on contracts, is a direct result of the seasonality of customer contracts and related payments received that impact our business.    The increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in liabilities for equity based long term incentive plans resulting from stronger performance of the Company's financial results, as well as, the Company's stock price in 2016. The current year provision for income taxes, which is partially offset by the discrete tax benefit of $11.5 million resulting from the sale of our European industrial manufacturing business in April 2016, also contributed to the increase in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities.  Accounts payable increased due to the timing of vendor payments near the end of the quarter.  The increase in other current assets and other assets is primarily due to the timing of prepaid expenses.    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $  0.3 million   was the net result of capital expenditures of $7.6 million and $2.3 million related to the final purchase adjustment for the acquisition of RBI, largely offset by net proceeds of $8.3 million from the sale of our European industrial manufacturing business.  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   of $119.9 million primarily consisted of $140.6 million of acquisitions and capital expenditures of $6.8 million offset by $26.4 million received from the sale of a property.  
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $2.2 million consisted of the proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of $2.9 million and a tax benefit from equity compensation of $0.9 million offset by the purchase of treasury stock of $1.2 million and payment of long-term debt borrowings of $0.4 million.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , of $10.3 million primarily consisted of proceeds from long-term debt borrowings, net of repayments of $10.6 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $0.2 million, partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of $0.6 million. 
  Senior Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Notes 
  Our Senior Credit Agreement dated December 9, 2015 provides for a revolving credit facility.  The Senior Credit Agreement was amended and restated in order to convert it into a secured cash flow revolver.  The terms provide that the revolving credit facility will terminate on December 9, 2020. 
  The Senior Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $300 million and is secured by trade receivables, inventory, personal property, equipment, and certain real property of the Company s significant domestic subsidiaries. 
  Interest rates on the revolving credit facility are based on the LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $287.5 million of availability under the Senior Credit Agreement net of outstanding letters of credit of $12.5 million.   To finance the acquisition of RBI in the second quarter of 2015, we borrowed amounts under the revolving credit facility which were repaid prior to the end of 2015.   No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  On   January 31, 2013  , the Company issued   $210 million   of   6.25%   Senior Subordinated Notes (  6.25%   Notes) due   February 1, 2021  .  The proceeds were used to purchase and discharge its obligations under the then outstanding   $204 million   of   8%   Senior Subordinated Notes during the first quarter of 2013.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
           (a) 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
       
  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered in this report.  Based upon that evaluation and the definition of disclosure controls and procedures contained in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weakness that existed in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
    
  Notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.   
    
           (b) 
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
       
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, management discovered deficiencies in the design of controls for a business acquired in 2015.  This acquired business had been previously excluded from management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as permitted under current SEC guidelines.  During management s 2016 evaluation and testing of these controls, deficiencies associated with the accounting for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting were identified during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. These deficiencies resulted in previously undetected errors in net sales recorded in prior 2016 reporting periods.  These errors did not have a material impact on our financial statements presented in those prior reporting periods; however, the cumulative effect of correcting these errors would have been material to the results of our operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Management has concluded that due to the total net sales transactions exposed to these deficiencies in 2016, the presence of these deficiencies within the process of accounting for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method rose to a level of material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016.  
    
  The Company has begun implementing changes to the design and application of new controls as well as make significant changes to the design of existing controls over the evaluation of the percentage of completion methodology for contracts. In addition, the Company has also begun to implement changes to ensure that controls will operate to a degree of precision that is appropriate for preventing or detecting material misstatements in revenue determined under the percentage of completion method of accounting on a timely basis. The Company has made progress towards remediation of our material weakness as of the date of this filing and expects to have these deficiencies remediated by December 31, 2016. We will continue the process of enhancing the design of our controls over the process for recognizing revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting as well as continue to test their effectiveness over the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Subject to the foregoing, there have been no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
