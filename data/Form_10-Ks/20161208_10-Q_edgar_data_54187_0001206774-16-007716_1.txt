CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.   
               
       Accounting Records and Use of
      Estimates:    

The accounting records
      are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
      in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of the Company s
      financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of
      contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues
      and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates that we make
      include allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization,
      income tax assets and liabilities, fair value of marketable securities and
      revenue recognition. Estimates are based on historical experience where
      applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable
      under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
      making estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates under
      different assumptions or conditions.   
        The interim financial
      statements are prepared pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form
      10-Q. The July 31, 2016 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived
      from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures
      required by GAAP. The interim financial statements and notes thereto
      should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
      included in the Company's latest Form 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal
      year ended July 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, the interim
      financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
      necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. The
      results of operations for the current period are not necessarily
      indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending July 31, 2017.  
       
        The computation of the
      annual expected effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain
      estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected
      operating income for the year and future periods, projections of the
      proportion of income (or loss), and permanent and temporary differences.
      The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes
      may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, or as
      additional information is obtained. To the extent that the estimated
      annual effective tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the
      change on prior quarters is included in tax expense for the current
      quarter.  
        As of July 31, 2015 and
      2016, the Company has a federal net operating loss approximating
      $6,609,000 and $6,576,000, respectively, which is available to offset
      future taxable income. In addition, as of July 31, 2015 and July 31, 2016,
      the Company had state and city net operating loss carryforwards of
      approximately $9,000,000 and $8,943,000, respectively, available to offset
      future state and city taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards
      will begin to expire, if not used, in 2035.   
        New York State and New
      York City taxes for years through July 31, 2015 were calculated using the
      higher of taxes based on income or the respective capital-based franchise
      taxes. In April 2014, the New York State governor signed into law
      legislation overhauling the New York State franchise tax on corporations.
      The changes in the law were effective for the Company s year ended July
      31, 2016. The state capital-based tax will be phased out over a 7-year
      period. The Company anticipates New York State taxes will be based on
      capital through 2022, and New York City taxes will be based on capital for
      the foreseeable future. Capital based franchise taxes are recorded to
      administrative and general expense.  
        Due to the application
      of the capital-based tax while the net operating loss still applies, or
      due to the possible absence of State taxable income in the years beyond
      2022 to which the State loss can be carried, the Company has not recorded
      the tax benefit of its New York State and New York City net operating loss
      carryforwards.

Recently issued
      accounting standards not yet adopted:      

In May 2014, the FASB
      issued 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 )
      establishing ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU
      2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in
      accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and
      supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09
      requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods
      or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
      which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
      services and also requires certain additional disclosures. ASU 2014-09 is
      effective for interim and annual reporting in fiscal years that begin
      after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-14 extended the implementation date for
      fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. The adoption of the update
      on August 1, 2018 is not expected to have a significant impact on our
      consolidated financial statements.   

In March 2016, the
      FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
      606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
      versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ) which is intended to improve the operability
      and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus
      agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,
       Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying
      Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ) which provides
      further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the
      operability and understandability of the licensing implementation
      guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from
      Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
      Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016- 12 ) which narrowly amended the revenue
      recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash consideration,
      presentation of sales tax and transition. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU
      2016-12 have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU
      2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
      the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
      disclosures.   

In February 2016, the
      FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 is intended to increase
      transparency and comparability among organizations of accounting for
      leasing arrangements. This guidance establishes a right-of-use model that
      requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on
      the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.
      Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
      classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income
      statement. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current model, but
      updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new
      revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2016-02 offers specific
      accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback
      transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and
      quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of
      the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of
      cash flows arising from leases. Entities will be required to recognize and
      measure leases as of the earliest period presented using a modified
      retrospective approach. The standard is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
      fiscal years. The new standard will be effective for the Company for the
      fiscal year beginning August 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The
      Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new
      standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
      disclosures.   

2.   
               
       Income Per Share
      of Common Stock:    

Income per share has
      been computed by dividing the net income for the periods by the weighted
      average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods,
      adjusted for the purchase of treasury stock. Shares used in computing
      income per share were 2,015,780 for the three months ended October 31,
      2016 and October 31, 2015.   

3.   
      
       Marketable
      Securities:    

The Company
      categorizes marketable securities as either trading, available-for-sale or
      held-to-maturity. Trading securities are carried at fair value with
      unrealized gains and losses included in income. Available-for-sale
      securities are carried at fair value measurements using quoted prices in
      active markets for identical assets or liabilities with unrealized gains
      and losses recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
      Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Dividends and
      interest income are accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses are
      determined on a specific identification basis. The Company reviews
      marketable securities for impairment whenever circumstances and situations
      change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not
      be recovered. The Company did not classify any securities as trading or
      held to maturity during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and July
      31, 2016.     
  -8-  

The Company follows GAAP which
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the valuation techniques and
creates the following three broad levels, with Level 1 valuation being the
highest priority:   
  Level 1 valuation inputs are
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
are accessible at the measurement date (e.g., equity securities traded on the
New York Stock Exchange).   
  Level 2 valuation inputs are
from other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted market
prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted market
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active).   
  Level 3 valuation inputs are
unobservable (e.g., an entity s own data) and should be used to measure fair
value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.   
  Following is a description of
the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at October
31, 2016 and July 31, 2016.   
  Equity securities are valued
at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual
securities are traded that the Company has access to.   
  Mutual funds are valued at the
daily closing price as reported by the fund. Mutual funds held by the Company
are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value
( NAV ) and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held by the Company are
deemed to be actively traded.   
  -9-  

In accordance with the
provisions of Fair Value Measurements, the following are the Company's financial
assets measured on a recurring basis presented at fair value.   

As of October 31, 2016 and
July 31, 2016, the Company's marketable securities were classified as
follows:  
  
  The Company's debt and equity
securities, gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment
category and length of time that the investment securities have been in a
continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:  

Investment income consists of
the following:  

-10-  

4.   
                 
       Financial Instruments and Credit Risk
      Concentrations:    

Financial instruments
      that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist
      principally of marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents and
      receivables. Marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents are
      placed with multiple financial institutions and multiple instruments to
      minimize risk. No assurance can be made that such financial institutions
      and instruments will minimize all such risk.   
        The Company derives
      rental income from forty-nine tenants, of which one tenant accounted for
      18.66%, another tenant accounted for 15.10% and a third tenant accounted
      for 10.52% of rental income during the three months ended October 31,
      2016. The three months ended October 31, 2015 had one tenant account for
      18.81% and another tenant account for 15.56% of rental income. No other
      tenant accounted for more than 10% of rental income during the same
      periods.   
        The Company has one
      irrevocable Letter of Credit totaling $230,000 at October 31, 2016 and
      July 31, 2016 provided by a tenant as a security deposit.

Note Payable -
      Related Party:      

On December 15, 2004,
      the Company borrowed $1,000,000 on an unsecured basis from a former
      director of the Company, who at the time was also a greater than 10%
      beneficial owner of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The
      former director passed away in November 2012 and the note is currently an
      asset of the estate of the former director. Interest payments pursuant to
      the note have been assigned to a trust provided for by the will of the
      deceased former director. The loan has been repeatedly renewed to its
      current maturity date of December 15, 2016 at an interest rate of 5% per
      annum. The note is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without
      penalty. The constant quarterly payment of interest is $12,500. The
      interest paid was $12,500 for each of the three month periods ended
      October 31, 2016 and 2015. It is the intention of the Company to pay this
      loan in full upon its maturity.     

8.    

Unbilled Receivables
      and Rental Income:     

Unbilled receivables
      represent the excess of scheduled rental income recognized on a
      straight-line basis over rental income as it becomes receivable according
      to the provisions of each lease.      
  -12-  

9.   
               
       Employees'
      Retirement Plan:    

The Company sponsors
      a noncontributory Money Purchase Plan covering substantially all of its
      non-union employees. Operations were charged $102,509 and $97,423 as
      contributions to the Plan for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and
      2015, respectively.   

Multi-employer
      plan:    

The Company
      contributes to a union sponsored multi-employer pension plan covering its
      union employees. The Company contributions to the pension plan were
      $12,611 and $13,153 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
      respectively. Contributions and costs are determined in accordance with
      the provisions of negotiated labor contracts or terms of the plans. The
      Company also contributes to union sponsored health benefit
  plans.   

Contingent
      Liability for Pension Plan:    

Information as to the
      Company s portion of accumulated plan benefits and plan assets is not
      reported separately by the pension plan. Under the Employee Retirement
      Income Security Act, upon withdrawal from a multi-employer benefit plan,
      an employer is required to continue to pay its proportionate share of the
      plan s unfunded vested benefits, if any. Any liability under this
      provision cannot be determined: however, the Company has not made a
      decision to withdraw from the plan.

       Entry
      into a Material Definitive Agreement:    

On June
      16, 2014, the Company entered into a Second Amendment of Lease (the
      "Amendment") with 33 Bond St. LLC ("Bond"), its landlord, for certain
      truck bays and approximately 1,000 square feet located at the cellar level
      within a garage at Livingston and Bond Street ("Premises"). Pursuant to
      the Amendment, (1) a lease option for the Premises was exercised extending
      the lease until December 8, 2043, (2) the Company, simultaneously with the
      execution of the Amendment, vacated the Premises so that Bond may demolish
      the building in which the Premises is located in order to develop and
      construct a new building at the location, and (3) Bond agreed to redeliver
      to the Company possession of the reconfigured Premises after
      construction.   

As
      consideration under the Amendment, Bond agreed to pay the Company a total
      of $3,500,000. Upon execution of the Amendment, the Company recorded
      $3,500,000 to deferred revenue to be amortized to revenue to temporarily
      vacate the premises over the expected vacate period of 36 months. Bond
      tendered $2,250,000 simultaneously with the execution of the Amendment,
      and the balance due of $1,250,000 on June 16, 2015 had been received by
      the Company.   

In
      connection with the Amendment, the parties also agreed to settle a pending
      lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County, Index
      No. 50796/13 (the "Action"), in which the Company sought, among other
      things, a declaratory judgment that it validly renewed the lease for the
      Premises, and Bond sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment that
      the lease expired by its terms on December 8, 2013. Pursuant to a
      stipulation of settlement, filed on June 16, 2014, the Action, including
      all claims and counterclaims, has been discontinued with prejudice,
      without costs or attorneys' fees to any party as against the other. The
      stipulation of settlement also contains general releases by both parties
      of all claims.   

14.   
      
       Contingencies:    

There are
      various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company. It is the opinion
      of management that the resolution of these matters will not have a
      material adverse effect on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial
      Statements.   

If the
      Company sells, transfers, disposes of, or demolishes 25 Elm Place,
      Brooklyn, New York, then the Company may be liable to create a condominium
      unit for the loading dock. The necessity of creating the condominium unit
      and the cost of such condominium unit cannot be determined at this
      time.   

Due to
      defective workmanship and breach of contract, the Company continues to
      pursue damages and return in full of a $376,467 deposit paid a contractor
      when work commenced to replace a roof on the Fishkill, New York building.
      There is a reasonable possibility the Company will not be paid in full and
      a charge to real estate operating expenses in the amount of $279,213 was
      recorded for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. Following initial court
      decisions in this matter, another $141,132 was charged to operating
      expenses as of October 31, 2016.

   J. W. MAYS, INC.
     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto contained in
this report. In this discussion, the words  Company ,  we ,  our  and  us  refer
to J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries.   
   Forward Looking Statements:
   
  The following can be
interpreted as including forward looking statements under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words  outlook ,  intend ,  plans ,
 efforts ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  expects  or words of similar import
typically identify such statements. Various important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements are identified under the heading  Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements  below. Our actual results may vary significantly
from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements based on a
number of factors including, but not limited to, availability of labor,
marketing success, competitive conditions and the change in economic conditions
of the various markets we serve.   
   Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates:    
  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the critical
accounting policies in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
disclose our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions. (See Note 1 on pages 7 and 8 to the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Note 1 on pages 9 through
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report to Shareholders
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016).   
   Results of Operations:
   
   Three months ended October
31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015:    
  In the three months ended
October 31, 2016, the Company reported net income of $462,025, or $.23 per
share. In the comparable three months ended October 31, 2015, the Company
reported net income of $401,375, or $.20 per share.   
  Revenues in the current three
months increased to $4,782,907 from $4,569,061 in the comparable 2015 three
months primarily due to increased rental income from existing tenants.
  
  The recovery of real estate
taxes in the current three months in the amount of $10,952, net of legal
expenses, represents recovery of prior years  real estate taxes from one of the
Company s properties. The comparable 2015 three months did not have a recovery
of real estate taxes.   
  Real estate operating expenses
in the current three months increased to $2,527,935 from $2,408,599 in the
comparable 2015 three months primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and
a charge for litigation against a contractor in the amount of $141,132 (see Note
14), partially offset by decreases in utility costs and leasing commission
costs.   
  Administrative and general
expenses in the current three months increased to $1,090,603 from $1,055,982 in
the comparable 2015 three months primarily due to increases in payroll costs,
medical costs and directors fees, partially offset by decreases in legal and
professional costs   
  -16-  

Depreciation and amortization
expense in the current three months increased to $412,627 from $406,750 in the
comparable 2015 three months primarily due to improvements in the Nine Bond
Street building in Brooklyn, New York.   
  Interest expense exceeded
investment income in the current three months by $58,717 and by $57,355 in the
comparable 2015 three months.   
   Liquidity and Capital
Resources:      
  Management considers current
working capital and borrowing capabilities adequate to cover the Company s
planned operating and capital requirements. The Company s cash and cash
equivalents amounted to $6,016,061 at October 31, 2016.   
  In May 2015, the Company
entered into a 20 year lease agreement with a new tenant (cancellation clause
after the 10th year) to occupy 17,425 square feet of office space at the Jowein
building in Brooklyn, New York. Occupancy is anticipated to commence in December
2016 and rent is anticipated to commence in March 2017. The amount of brokerage
commissions and construction costs were $496,266 and $1,749,431, respectively.
The construction was completed in November 2016.  
  In August 2016, a tenant at
the Company s Circleville, Ohio property leased an additional 12,000 square feet
of warehouse space effective August 16, 2016.   
  In October 2016, a tenant at
the Company s Levittown, New York property extended its lease for an additional
five years expiring May 3, 2023.   
  In October 2016, a tenant who
occupies 2,680 square feet of retail space at the Company s Jamaica, New York
property vacated the space. The space was leased to an existing tenant at a
higher annual rental income effective November 2016.   
   Cash Flows From Operating
Activities:    
  Payroll and Other Accrued
Liabilities: The Company had a balance due at October 31, 2016 for brokerage
commissions of $256,105. Brokerage commissions in the amount of $60,005 were
paid in the three months ended October 31, 2016.   
   Cash Flows From Investing
Activities:    
  The Company had expenditures
of $370,085 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 at its Jowein, New York
building for renovations for an existing tenant. The cost of the project was
$370,085 and was completed in September 2016.   
  The Company had expenditures
of $31,540 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, for a new office tenant
at its Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. The cost of the project was
$1,749,431 of which $1,728,832 has been paid. The project was completed in
November 2016.   
  The Company had expenditures
of $114,695 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 for fa ade restoration
work at the Company s Nine Bond Street, Brooklyn, New York building. The cost of
the project was $199,883 and was completed in December 2016.

Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:    
  This section, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other
sections of this Report on Form 10-Q and other reports and verbal statements
made by our representatives from time to time may contain forward-looking
statements that are based on our assumptions, expectations and projections about
us and the real estate industry. These include statements regarding our
expectations about revenues, our liquidity, our expenses and our continued
growth, among others. Such forward-looking statements by their nature involve a
degree of risk and uncertainty. We caution that a variety of factors, including
but not limited to the factors listed below, could cause business
conditions and our results to differ materially from what is contained in
forward-looking statements:   

changes in the rate of economic growth in the
      United States;  

the ability to obtain credit from financial
      institutions and the related costs;  

changes in the financial condition of our
      customers;  

changes in regulatory environment;  

lease cancellations;  

changes in our estimates of costs;  

war and/or terrorist attacks on facilities
      where services are or may be provided;  

outcomes of pending and future
litigation;  

increasing competition by other
companies;  

compliance with our loan covenants;  

recoverability of claims against our customers and others by us and
      claims by third parties against us; and   

changes in estimates used in our critical
      accounting policies.   
  Other factors and assumptions
not identified above were also involved in the formation of these
forward-looking statements and the failure of such other assumptions to be
realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected. Most of these factors are difficult to predict
accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas
of risk described above in connection with any forward-looking statements that
may be made by us.   
  We undertake no obligation to
publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to review any
additional disclosures we make in proxy statements, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K and any Form 8-K reports filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission.   
   Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk:    
  The Company uses fixed-rate
debt to finance its capital requirements. These transactions do not expose the
Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company does
not use derivative financial instruments. At October 31, 2016, the Company had
fixed-rate debt of $6,748,263.   
   Item 4. Controls and
Procedures:    
   Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    
  Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded,
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective and provide reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.   
   Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting    
  There have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.   
  -18-  

Part II - Other Information
   
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings

From time to time we are
involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our
opinion, the outcome of such matters in the aggregate will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

There have been no changes to
our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our
fiscal year ended July 31, 2016.

  5. The registrant's other
certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation

performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)  
      All significant
      deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
      internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
      adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize
      and report financial information; and   

(b)   
      Any fraud, whether or
      not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
      significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial
      reporting.
