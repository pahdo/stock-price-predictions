Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements       This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.       In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "proposed," "intended," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other "forward-looking" information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

     Table of Contents            SPOTLIGHT INNOVATION INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (unaudited)       NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION       Spotlight Innovation Inc. (the  Company ) was organized under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 23, 2012 under the name Spotlight Innovation, LLC. In December 2013, the Company, through a reverse acquisition, merged with American Exploration Corporation ( American Exploration ). The Company is a life science company that identifies and acquires rights of innovative, proprietary technologies designed to address unmet medical needs, with an emphasis on rare, emerging and neglected diseases. To find and evaluate unique opportunities, we leverage our extensive relationships with leading scientists, academic institutions and other sources. We provide value-added development capability to accelerate progress. When scientifically significant benchmarks have been achieved, we will endeavor to partner with proven market leaders via sale, out-license or strategic alliance.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company had five subsidiaries: Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc., Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (see Note 10 below), CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, Inc., Zika Therapeutics, Inc. and Caretta Therapeutics, Inc.       Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc.       On June 4, 2014, Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc. (hereinafter "Celtic Iowa," a subsidiary of the Company) acquired Celtic Biotech Limited (hereinafter "Celtic Limited"). Celtic Limited was founded in 2003 in Dublin, Ireland and is developing novel and highly specialized compounds derived from snake venom, for the treatment of solid cancers and cancer imaging.        Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc.       The Company acquired approximately 82% of Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Memcine") in June 2015. The Company agreed to provide Memcine with up to $3,000,000 to fund the operations of Memcine via investment, grants or other means over the course of operations, upon the achievement of certain milestones, as determined by the board of directors of Memcine. Memcine, founded in 2010, holds the exclusive worldwide rights to Immunoplex, , a vaccine platform technology developed at the University of Iowa, with universal application to numerous antigens developed to improve vaccine efficacy by using more efficient targeting and delivery.     On October 12, 2016, the Company terminated its interests in Memcine (see Note 10 below).       CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, Inc.       CDT Veterinary Therapeutics was formed in November 2015 to create reformulated variants of certain compounds, modified to meet the needs of the veterinary market. In September 2016, the Company decided to temporarily suspend its activities in CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, Inc.       Caretta Therapeutics, Inc.       Caretta Therapeutics, Inc. ( Caretta ) was formed in August 2016 to develop the commercialization of over-the-counter products. Caretta holds a license agreement to develop, manufacture and sell certain products derived from snake venom that may have analgesic properties.        Zika Therapeutics, Inc.       Zika Therapeutics, Inc. ( ZT ) was formed in August 2016 to pursue the therapeutic treatment for this emerging health threat. On August 19, 2016, the Company entered a Sponsored Research Agreement (the  SRA ) with the Florida State University Research Foundation ( FSURF ) starting September 1, 2016, to perform certain research, over a two-year period, related to the discovery, synthetic modification, and preclinical validation of drug-like compounds intended to treat patients with Zika virus infection to be directed by Dr. Hengli Tang.                   7       
     Table of Contents           Basis of Presentation       The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year, as reported in the Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC, have been omitted.      NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Use of Estimates       The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those regarding the valuation of option and warrant transactions.        Principles of Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts, including those of the Company s subsidiaries Celtic Iowa and Memcine. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company acquired 95% of the outstanding shares of Celtic Biotech. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired 82.25% of the outstanding shares of Memcine. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated Celtic Limited, Celtic Iowa and Memcine. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.       Non-Controlling Interest       The Company is required to report the non-controlling interest in Celtic Limited, a subsidiary of Celtic Iowa, and Memcine, as a separate component of shareholders  equity. The Company is also required to present the consolidated net income and the portion of the consolidated net income allocable to the non-controlling interest and to the shareholders of the Company separately in its consolidated statements of operations. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest are allocated to the non-controlling interest even when those losses are in excess of the non-controlling interest s investment basis.       Loss per Common Share       Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants or the assumed conversion of convertible debt instruments, using the treasury stock and  if converted  method. For periods in which net losses are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.     For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the dilutive effect of the issuance of 448,571 and 5,200 options, 208,500 and 885,000 warrants, and 3,317,971, and 1,774,650 common shares issuable for conversion of convertible debt, respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.                  8       
     Table of Contents           Concentrations of Credit Risk       Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash deposits placed with financial institutions. The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $0 of cash balances that were uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.       Foreign exchange and currency translation       For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company maintained cash accounts in U.S. Dollars and European Union euros, and incurred certain expenses denominated in European Union euros. The Company's and its consolidated subsidiaries  functional and reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect on the date of the transactions. Assets and liabilities are remeasured using exchange rates at the end of each period. Exchange gains or losses on re-measurements are included in earnings.      In the event that the functional currency of a Company s consolidated subsidiary was not the U.S. Dollar, then that subsidiary s foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the current exchange rate and non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using historical exchange rates. Such adjustments resulting from the translation process would be reported in a separate component of other comprehensive income and are not included in the determination of the results of operations. As of September 30, 2016, and 2015, the Company had no subsidiaries with functional currencies that required translation.       In-Process Research and Development       In-process research and development ( IPR D ) represents the estimated fair value assigned to research and development projects acquired in a purchased business combination that have not been completed at the date of acquisition and which have no alternative future use. IPR D assets acquired in a business combination are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets remain indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the periods prior to completion or abandonment, those acquired indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. During periods after completion, those acquired indefinite-lived assets are amortized based on their useful life.        Equipment       Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing equipment are capitalized. Upon disposition or retirement of equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is 3-10 years.       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles       The Company performs impairment tests on its long-lived assets when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If required, recoverability is tested by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the asset or asset group is written down to fair value. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $0 in impairment to the Company s long-lived assets.                   9       
     Table of Contents           Stock-Based Compensation       The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock and stock options based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company determines the fair value of shares of non-vested stock (also commonly referred to as restricted stock) based on the last quoted price of our stock on the date of the share grant. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. As share-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the Company reduces the expense for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates, if such historical forfeiture rates are available. Previously recognized compensation costs may be adjusted to reflect the actual forfeiture rate for the entire award at the end of the vesting period. Excess tax benefits, if any, are recognized as an addition to paid-in capital.       Income Taxes       The Company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that the value of such assets will be realized.         Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The Company follows FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ), which clarifies fair value as an exit price, establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework for measuring fair value, and requires extended disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 apply to all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.     As defined in ASC 820, fair value, clarified as an exit price, represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a result, fair value is a market-based approach that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.     As a basis for considering these assumptions, ASC 820 defines a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value.                 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                 Level 2   Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.                 Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.        The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.       Subsequent Events       The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date when financial statements are issued for disclosure consideration.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to have a material effect on the Company s operations, financial position or cash flows.             NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN      The Company is an early stage company and as such has not generated revenues from operations and there is no assurance of any future revenues. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had accumulated net losses of $23,171,473, and had a working capital deficit of $5,446,418. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s successful efforts to raise sufficient capital and then attain profitable operations. Management is investigating all options to raise enough funds to meet the Company s working capital requirements through either the sale of the Company s common stock or other financings. There can be no assurances, however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company.       NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE      On December 16, 2013, the Company assumed the liabilities of American Exploration which included the following notes payable too unrelated third parties:         The Company also assumed $92,923 in accrued interest related to these notes. The Company recorded $21,861 and $21,540 in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on the above notes payable. On September 1, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement and release agreement with Pierco Management as set forth in the table below:                The Company and Pierco Management agreed to the following:                   Immediate cash payment of $25,000 from the Company.                        A deferred cash payment of $25,000 due in 90 days from the effective date.                        Issuance to Pierco Management of $50,000 worth of Company common stock using the average closing price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the effective date of the agreement.           The Company also assumed a liability for previous advances made by American Exploration s former CEO in the amount of $23,433 of which the Company repaid $3,500 in calendar year 2015 bringing the balance to the current $19,933 at September 30, 2016. These advances are due on demand and do not bear interest.     On December 31, 2015 recorded a guarantee for one of the lenders in the amount of $34,529.      On September 6, 2016, the Company agreed to assume the unpaid interest for the portion of the April and July Letters-of-Credit with Denver Savings Bank that was to be paid from the debt service reserve as set forth in the Termination and Release Agreements in December 2015. The assumption of the interest resulted in the Company recording an additional $83,441 of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.        NOTE 5. CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS       Discussion concerning convertible instruments can be found in Note 7 below.        NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES      Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income.     At September 30, 2016, the Company s deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carry forwards acquired in connection with the merger. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the material reconciling items between the tax benefit computed at the statutory rate and the actual benefit recognized in the financial statements consisted of expenses related to share-based compensation and the change in the valuation allowance during the applicable period. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance as management believes it is likely that any deferred tax assets will not be realized.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $21 million, which will expire between years 2028 and 2035. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, our net operating loss carry forwards are expected to be subject to significant annual limitations for the change in ownership that resulted in the Merger.

The warrants previously issued pursuant to the December 31, 2015 Convertible Note remain in effect. The material terms of the Amended Note include: interest at the rate of 8% per annum, which shall begin to accrue on January 1, 2017; Company may prepay the Amended Note (a) on or before December 31, 2017, with consent, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, for such purposes, including but not limited to a Nasdaq listing of the Company s securities, or as a condition to an equity financing, and (b) at any time after December 31, 2017 upon 30 days written notice by the Company; principal amount and interest may be converted into shares of common stock of the Company at a discount of 15% of the average price of the common stock of the Company during the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to such conversion, but not less than $0.75; and the maturity date is December 31, 2021.

The Company agreed to issue 4,000,000 shares of common stock, with standard restrictive legend.                               The following warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company were terminated:                         The Company issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company as follows:            On October 26, 2016, the Company invested $200,000 with the potential to invest an additional $1.3 million dollars, in Solx, Inc. ( Solx ), a privately-held medical device company. Solx is dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative surgical technologies that threat refectory and moderate glaucoma and preserve vision.      On October 26, 2016, the Company entered into a restructuring term sheet with K4, whereby K4 agreed to attempt to (i) re-negotiate and assume certain payments owed to two third parties (the  Debt Service ), and (ii) re-negotiate and assume the $752,325 and $250,975 outstanding Letters of Credit with Denver Savings Bank (collectively the  LOCs ), prior to January 31, 2017. If K4 renegotiates and assumes the Debt Service and the LOCs, the Company will, on the closing date, issue to K4 a Convertible Promissory Note with the principal balance equal to the sum of (i) the principal balance outstanding on the LOCs as of the closing date, and (ii) the Debt Service as of the closing date.

The Company will, as additional consideration for the refinancing, issue K4 a warrant to purchase 1,875,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $1.20 per share, expiring December 31, 2018.     In November 2016, the Company converted Caretta Therapeutics, Inc. from a corporation to a limited liability company.                 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        Overview      The Company is a life sciences company that identifies and acquires rights to innovative proprietary technologies designed to address unmet medical needs, with an emphasis on rare, emerging and neglected diseases. To find and evaluate unique opportunities, we leverage our extensive relationships with leading scientists, academic institutions and other sources. We provide value-added development capability to accelerate the progress. When scientifically significant benchmarks have been achieved, we will endeavor to partner with proven market leaders via sale, out-license or strategic alliance. We believe that targeting rare and/or neglected indications offers and accelerated path to market, support from nonprofit advocacy groups, scarcity of competition, and pricing leverage.      Plan of Operation      Through September 30, 2016, management successfully completed two acquisitions, Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc. and Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and has three other subsidiaries.      Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. Management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to retention of additional personnel, and advancement of our technologies. We anticipate that we will finance these expenses with further issuances of equity securities and debt issuances.      The Company anticipates securing additional financing in 2016. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. There can be no assurances, however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company.       Critical Accounting Policies      Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Financial Condition and Changes in Financial Condition       Overall Operating Results:       Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenue.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, sales were $0. The lack of revenues is due to the Company continuing to develop technologies in the health field.        General and Administrative Expenses   .  Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $1,625,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $2,054,312 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a $428,612 decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in development expense and investor relations expense.              Other Income (Expense).   For the three months ended September 30, 2016, other expense was $336,708, compared to $150,677 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other expense was primarily due a net loss in settlement of debt in the amount of $195,656 for 2016.       Net Loss   .  The Company s net loss was $1,962,408 and $2,204,989 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly due to an increase in professional fees and consulting services, offset by the change in the fair value of the derivative liability and a net loss in settlement of debt, as noted above.      Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenue.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, sales were $0. The lack of revenues is due to the Company continuing to develop technologies in the health field.       General and Administrative Expenses   .  Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $3,962,006 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $3,471,051 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a $490,955 increase. The increase was mainly due to an increase in professional and consulting fees.       Other Income (Expense).   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other expense was $607,305, compared to $698,296 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to decreased interest expense related to the restructuring of debt and the termination and release agreements the Company entered into as of December 31, 2015 resulting in less interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015, offset by a net loss in settlement of debt.       Net Loss   .  The Company s net loss was $4,569,311 and $4,169,347 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly due to an increase in professional fees and consulting services and a decrease in interest expense, as noted above.      Liquidity and Capital Resources:      The Company had $289,264 in cash as of September 30, 2016. The Company has negative working capital of $5,446,418 and total stockholders  equity of $1,562,948 as of September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has experienced recurring losses from operations and may not have enough cash and working capital to fund its operations beyond the very near term, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management has made a similar note in the financial statements. The Company anticipates it will need approximately $3,000,000 for the next twelve months to fund operations. We may be required to seek additional capital by selling debt or equity securities, selling assets, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders. We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.      The Company has been receiving funding from K4 Enterprises, LLC ( K4 Enterprises ) beginning in May, 2016 to meet short-term operational needs while the Company attempts to attract new outside funding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, K4 Enterprises has provided short-term operating cash totaling $870,000 in the form of cash advances or direct payment of invoices for the Company.        Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015         Cash Flows from Operating Activities   .  The Company had net cash used in operating activities of $2,192,261 and $1,369,832 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operating activities is related to the increase in consulting and professional fees incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities   .  The Company had net cash provided by investing activities of $5,161 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used of $5,524 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.               Cash Flows from Financing Activities   .  The Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $2,186,767 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,907,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is due to proceeds from a demand note from K4 and proceeds from the $2.5 million offering discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.         Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no accounting standards and interpretations issued which are expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, operations or cash flows.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk       Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a   smaller reporting company,  as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).       Item 4. Controls and Procedures         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as required in applicable SEC rules and forms, due in part, to the limited personnel of the Company. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       Neither the Company nor its property is a party to any pending legal proceeding.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       There are no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       Responsive information previously has been included in a Current Report on Form 8-K.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities       The Company was in technical default of some of its obligations. On September 1, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement and release agreement with Pierco Management as set forth in the table below         The Company and Pierco Management agreed to the following:                   Immediate cash payment of $25,000 from the Company.                        A deferred cash payment of $25,000 due in 90 days from the effective date.                        Issuance to Pierco Management of $50,000 worth of Company common stock using the average closing price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the effective date of the agreement.          As a result of the settlement and release agreement, the technical default has been resolved.       Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures       None.       Item 5. Other Information       None.

Caretta Therapeutics agrees that it shall cooperate in the prosecution of such patents including signing any necessary documents or providing copies of data already created in order to advance such prosecution. Reid will promptly copy Caretta Therapeutics on all correspondence and prosecution documents regarding the patent applications and provide Caretta Therapeutics at least forty-five (45) days to review and comment on prosecution matters. Reid will thoughtfully consider Caretta Therapeutics comments on prosecution matters and suggestions regarding in which countries a patent application should be filed. If Reid decides to abandon or forego prosecution of an application in a particular country, he will so notify Caretta Therapeutics at least sixty days (60) prior to such abandonment and allow Caretta Therapeutics the opportunity to take over prosecution of the application at its own expense and control, and to grant a perpetual royalty-free license in the territory where the application was filed, or the option of accepting assignment of the application in that particular country without further payment by Caretta Therapeutics.     5.2 Caretta Therapeutics will have the right to initiate any legal action against a third party infringer of any of the Reid Patents, including those listed in Exhibit A or an application or continuing application of same which has matured into a patent, in its own name and at its sole control and expense.

The parties will mutually agree on matters regarding patent counsel and prosecution of the patents and shall share costs.

Introduction:  This exclusive license agreement (the  Agreement ) is made and entered into as of October 13, 2016 (the  Effective Date ) by and between:     Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation ( IURTC ), a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of Indiana, having its principal offices at 518 Indiana Ave., Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, and      Spotlight Innovation, Inc. ( Spotlight ), a company organized under the laws of Nevada, having its principal offices at 6750 Westown Pkwy Ste 200-226, West Des Moines, Iowa 50266.     The Parties hereby agree:      1 Background :  IURTC and The Brigham and Women s Hospital, Inc. ( BWH ) are co-owners of certain intellectual property rights invented by Elliot Androphy, M.D. at Indiana University and Kevin Hodgetts, Ph.D. at BWH (the  Inventors  collectively, Indiana University and BWH are the  Institutions ). IURTC and BWH entered into an agreement effective January 1, 2016 which grants IURTC the right to grant licenses under both parties  ownership rights in the intellectual property. IURTC is willing to grant licenses to these intellectual property rights provided the rights are used to further scientific research, for new product development, and for other applications in the public interest. Spotlight represents to IURTC that it has the necessary product development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on such intellectual property rights. Spotlight desires to obtain a license to commercialize these intellectual property rights upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.       2 Definitions:  In addition to other capitalized terms defined herein, the following words and phrases have the meanings assigned to them below.      2.1  Affiliate : Any entity that, directly or indirectly, owns or controls Spotlight or that is owned or controlled by or is under common ownership or control with Spotlight. Own(s) or control(s) means:      2.1.1 Direct or indirect ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of a corporation;      2.1.2 The right to receive at least fifty percent (50%) of the earnings of the entity in question; or      2.1.3 The right to control the business decisions of the entity in question.             2.2 Development Plan: Spotlight s good faith, bona fide plan for the development, manufacture, promotion, importation, use, sale, and marketing of Licensed Products.

Spotlight acknowledges that extension under 35 U.S.C.  156 must be applied for within sixty (60) days of the date that a Licensed Product receives permission under the provision of law under which the applicable regulatory review period occurred for commercial marketing or use, and that Spotlight s failure to promptly provide the necessary information or assistance to IURTC during such sixty day period will cause serious injury to IURTC, for which Spotlight will be liable at law. The Parties will also cooperate in selecting the Licensed Product each supplementary protection certificate referencing the Patent Rights will list.         10 Third Party Infringement:      10.1 Spotlight will give prompt written notice to IURTC of any known or suspected infringement of the Patent Rights after which Spotlight at its sole expense may attempt to abate any infringement of the Patent Rights in the Field and the Territory. Upon receipt of IURTC s written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, Spotlight may initiate and prosecute actions in IURTC s name against third parties for infringement and/or unfair trade practices through outside counsel of its choice which is reasonably acceptable to IURTC. Spotlight will consult with IURTC prior to and in conjunction with all significant issues regarding such action including without limitation settlement thereof, will keep IURTC informed of all proceedings, and will provide copies to IURTC of all pleadings, legal analyses, and other papers related to such actions. IURTC will provide reasonable assistance to Spotlight in prosecuting any such actions and will be compensated by Spotlight, including without limitation for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, which IURTC will only be required to expend if Spotlight has approved same for reimbursement. Absent IURTC s and BWH s prior written consent, Spotlight will not settle or compromise any claim or action in a manner that grants rights or concessions to a third party to the Patent Rights or a Licensed Product or admits the fault of or creates any obligation on IURTC, IU, BWH, or any Inventor.     10.2 Any damages paid (including without limitation statutory damages, compensatory damages, lost profits damages, exemplary damages, increased damages, and awards of costs and attorney fees) will first be applied to reimbursement of Spotlight s reasonable costs, expenses, and legal fees, including without limitation amounts Spotlight has reimbursed or must reimburse to IURTC. The remaining balance of such damages will be distributed [***].     10.3 If Spotlight fails or declines to take any action under Paragraph 10.1 within a reasonable time after learning of third party infringement or unfair trade practices, IURTC will have the right, but not the obligation ,  to take appropriate actions against any such third party at its sole expense and to retain all recovered damages. In such instances, Spotlight will cooperate as requested by IURTC, including without limitation joining in an action and will be reimbursed by IURTC for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, which Spotlight will only be required to expend if IURTC has approved same for reimbursement.       11 Indemnification:      11.1 Spotlight will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless IURTC, the Institutions, their respective affiliates, Board of Directors, trustees, employees, faculty, staff, students, Inventors, successors, heirs, assigns, independent contractors, and agents (collectively,  IURTC Indemnitees ) from and against any and all judgments, liabilities, losses, damages, actions, claims, costs, or expenses (including without limitation all attorney fees and costs incurred by IURTC Indemnitees) (collectively,  Losses ) arising out of or relating to the exercise of any rights conveyed under this Agreement and/or by Sublicense, breach of any term or condition under this Agreement and/or Sublicense, and/or the negligence, willful malfeasance, and/or willful misconduct by Spotlight and/or Affiliates, successors, assigns, or Sublicensees, including without limitation:     11.1.1 The use of any Patent Rights, including without limitation, in the design, development, production, manufacture, sale, offer for sale, use, importation, exportation, lease, marketing, or promotion of any Licensed Product;     11.1.2 Product liability, injury or death to any person, damage to property, or any injury to business, including without limitation, business interruption or damage to reputation, arising out of and/or relating to the use of the Patent Rights or a Licensed Product; and        11.1.3 Any third party claim that any use of Confidential Information or licensing of the Patent Rights, or development, provision, or use of Licensed Products violates or infringes a third party s intellectual property rights;     except to the extent of the Losses that are solely attributable to the breach, negligence, recklessness, willful malfeasance, or willful misconduct of IURTC.     11.2 Spotlight at its sole expense will defend third party claims. Spotlight will have the right to conduct the defense of such actions through outside counsel of its choice which is reasonably acceptable to IURTC and BWH. Spotlight will consult with IURTC and BWH prior to and in conjunction with all significant issues, will keep IURTC and BWH informed of all proceedings, and will provide copies to IURTC and BWH of all pleadings, legal analyses, and other papers related to such actions. IURTC will provide reasonable assistance to Spotlight in defending any such actions, and IURTC Indemniteeswill have the right to retain its own counsel, at the expense of Spotlight, if representation of such Indemnitees by counsel retained by Spotlight would be inappropriate because of actual or potential differences in the interests of such Indemnitees and any other party represented by such counsel. Spotlight will not settle or compromise any claim or action in a manner that admits the fault of, imposes restrictions, or creates obligations on IURTC Indemnitees or requires any financial payment or admission of liability by IURTC Indemnitees. Spotlight will consult with IURTC and BWH prior to any proposed settlement.      11.3 If Spotlight fails to defend a claim or action within twenty (20) days of learning of the same, in addition to and not in lieu of other rights and remedies, IURTC may assume the defense for the account of and at the risk of Spotlight, and any resulting liability, including attorney fees, will be deemed conclusively to be a liability of Spotlight. Spotlight s failure or refusal to act is a material breach of this Agreement.      12 Insurance:      12.1 Commencing on the Effective Date, Spotlight will maintain insurance that is reasonably sufficient to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation workers  compensation insurance with statutory limits as required by law; commercial general liability insurance with coverage of not less than [***] for any single occurrence and [***] in the aggregate. Upon commencing human testing or sales, Spotlight will maintain product liability insurance that is reasonably sufficient to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, but not less than [***] for any single occurrence and [***] in the aggregate. In connection with the conduct of any clinical testing, Spotlight will maintain professional liability insurance (errors and omissions) that is reasonably sufficient to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, but not less than [***] for any single occurrence and [***] in the aggregate. Upon commencement of coverage (as required above) and thereafter annually upon renewal, Spotlight will provide IURTC and BWH with written evidence of insurance. Such insurance will list IURTC Indemnitees as an additional insured. All policies will be endorsed to indicate that they provide primary coverage without right of contribution by any insurance carrier or self-insured by IURTC Indemnitees. A waiver of subrogation in favor of the Indemnitees will also be endorsed to the policies. If such coverage is not written on an  occurrence  basis (i.e., it is written on a  claims made  basis), Spotlight will maintain such insurance coverage during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years thereafter. For purposes of this Paragraph 12.1, references to  Spotlight  will include any Affiliates extended rights under Paragraph 3.2 and Sublicensees.            12.2 Beginning at such time as any such product, process or service is being commercially distributed, sold, leased or otherwise transferred, or performed or used (other than for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals), by Spotlight, Affiliates extended rights under Paragraph 3.2 or Sublicensees, Spotlight will, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain commercial general liability insurance in amounts not less than [***] per incident and [***] annual aggregate and naming the IURTC Indemnitees as additional insureds. Such commercial general liability insurance will provide (i) product liability coverage and (ii) broad form contractual liability coverage for Spotlight s indemnification under Article 11 of this Agreement. [***]. The minimum amounts of insurance coverage required under this Paragraph 12.2 will not be construed to create a limit of Spotlight s liability with respect to its indemnification under Article 11 of this Agreement.     12.3 Spotlight will provide IURTC and BWH with written evidence of such insurance upon request of IURTC and/or BWH. Spotlight will provide IURTC and BWH with written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance; if Spotlight does not obtain replacement insurance providing comparable coverage prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, IURTC will have the right to terminate this Agreement effective at the end of such thirty (30) day period without notice or any additional waiting periods.      12.4 Spotlight will maintain such commercial general liability insurance beyond the termination of this Agreement during (i) the period that any such product, process, or service is being commercially distributed, sold, leased or otherwise transferred, or performed or used (other than for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals), by Spotlight or by a Sublicensee, Affiliates extended rights under Paragraph 3.2 or agent of Spotlight and (ii) a reasonable period after the period referred to in Paragraph 12.4 (i) above which in no event will be less than fifteen (15) years.      13 Termination:      13.1 Spotlight may terminate this Agreement with or without cause on ninety (90) days advance written notice to IURTC. The rights granted by IURTC herein, including without limitation in Article 3, will terminate and automatically revert to IURTC at the end of the 90-day period.     13.2 Time is of the essence for Spotlight to develop Licensed Products and make payments and reports theron. The fee stated in Paragraph 5.1 and the reimbursement of past patent costs under Paragraph 9.3 are due within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, and if such payments are not received by IURTC thereby, this Agreement is null, void, and without effect.     13.3 IURTC may terminate this Agreement in whole or in part on sixty (60) days advance written notice to Spotlight upon Spotlight s breach of this Agreement, including without limitation for:     13.3.1 Failure to timely pay any fee, royalty, or other payment required, including without limitation, those due under Article 5, Paragraph 6.3, Article 9, or Paragraph 10.2, and including without limitation any interest on and fees and costs attributable to the collection of late payments under Paragraph 6.4;        13.3.2 Failure to timely provide reports or notices, including without limitation, those due under Paragraphs 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 6.2, or 14.1;     13.3.3 Failure to keep accurate and completed books and records under Paragraph 6.3;      13.3.4 Failure to obtain, maintain, or timely report levels of insurance under Article 12;      13.3.5 Failure to include all required terms in Sublicenses or inclusion of any terms prohibited under Paragraph 3.3;      13.3.6 Failure to indemnify IURTC Indemnitees or properly inform or involve IURTC under Article 11; and     13.3.7 Breach of Spotlight s representations or warranties under Paragraph 8.2.     13.4 To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, Spotlight agrees that in the event Spotlight by its own actions or the action of any of its shareholders or creditors files or has filed against it, with an order for relief being entered, a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as previously or hereafter amended, IURTC will be entitled to relief from the automatic stay of Section 362 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, as amended, on or against the exercise of the rights and remedies available to IURTC. Spotlight hereby waives the benefits of such automatic stay and consents and agrees to raise no objection to such relief. Spotlight further agrees that IURTC, at its sole discretion, may immediately terminate this Agreement by means of a written notice to Spotlight in the event that a creditor or other claimant takes possession of, or a receiver, administrator, or similar officer is appointed over any of the assets of Spotlight, or in the event that Spotlight makes any voluntary arrangement with its creditors or becomes subject to any court or administration order under any U.S. bankruptcy proceedings or insolvency law. Spotlight will promptly inform IURTC of its intention to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or of another s communicated intention to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.     13.5 As of the date of termination of this Agreement by either Party for any reason under the terms herein, including expiration of the Term, all rights granted by IURTC will terminate and automatically revert to IURTC. Upon termination other than through expiration of this Agreement, Spotlight agrees not to practice or permit another to practice the Patent Rights. All terms and conditions herein that, by their express terms or by implication, are to be performed after the termination of this Agreement or are prospective in nature will survive termination, as the case may be, including without limitation the provisions in Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 and Spotlight s obligations to pay fees, royalties, or other payments and patent expenses accruing prior thereto. Articles 11 and 12 will survive expiration of this Agreement.     13.6 Upon termination of this Agreement, Spotlight will promptly notify its Affiliates extended rights under Paragraph 3.2 and Sublicensees of such termination. Any rights previously granted by Spotlight under Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 will be automatically revoked thirty (30) days following the effective date of termination of this Agreement. However, any Sublicensee in compliance with its Sublicense and evidencing to IURTC its ability to meet the requirements of Article 4 and Paragraph 3.5 has the right to enter into a written license agreement with IURTC before its Sublicense is revoked, through which such Sublicensee will become bound to IURTC on substantially the same terms and conditions, including without limitation financial terms, as Sublicensee was bound to Spotlight under the Sublicense, but only to the extent that each financial term is no less favorable to IURTC than those set forth in Article 5 and Paragraph 9.4, and provided that the Sublicense does not impose any obligations on IURTC in excess of those imposed under this Agreement. If any Sublicensee desires to enter into such a license agreement, it will be wholly the responsibility of that Sublicensee to notify IURTC of such desire within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination of this Agreement. IURTC hereby agrees to enter into such written license agreement, with modifications negotiated in good faith as is reasonably necessary to accommodate the functional and structural differences between Spotlight and IURTC. Time is of the essence for a Sublicensee to provide notice of its desire for such license and to negotiate in good faith in a timely manner to effectuate a license. Failure of a Sublicensee to timely provide such notice or enter into such license will automatically result in the termination of the Sublicense and all rights granted thereunder or hereunder, including but not limited to IURTC s obligation to enter into such license with Sublicensee.             14 Assignment of this Agreement:      14.1 This Agreement will not be assigned, in whole or in part, by either Party to any third party without the written consent of the non-assigning Party. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

Any conveyance in contravention with the terms and conditions of this Agreement is null and void.     14.3 This Agreement is binding on the Parties and their respective successors and assigns and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.      15 Notice:       15.1 Any required or permissive notice under this Agreement will be sufficient if in writing and delivered personally, by recognized national overnight courier, or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address below and will be deemed to have been given as of the date shown on the receipt if by certified or registered mail, or the day following dispatch if by overnight courier.

Neither Party waives its right to seek reimbursement of documented attorney fees in any action to enforce this Agreement.     16.2 No waiver of any breach of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing by the Party against whom the waiver is sought to be asserted. The delay or failure to assert a right or to insist upon compliance with any term or condition of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that right or excuse a similar subsequent failure to perform any such term or condition.     16.3 The Parties acknowledge that they have read this Agreement in its entirety and agree that this instrument comprises the entire agreement, contract, and understanding of the Parties on the subject matter of this Agreement.

This license grant is subject to the government license rights in Section 17 herein.                            2.2.1  Licensee may grant written, Sublicenses to third parties. Any agreement granting a Sublicense shall state that the Sublicense is subject to the termination of this Agreement. Licensee shall have the same responsibility for the activities of any Sublicensee or Affiliate as if the activities were directly those of Licensee. This right is subject to the requirement that any sublicense is subject to the HHS Inter-Institutional Agreement attached as Appendix A.                         2.2.2  In respect to Sublicenses granted by Licensee under 2.2.1 above, Licensee shall pay to FSURF an amount equal to what Licensee would have been required to pay to FSURF had Licensee sold the amount of Licensed Products or Licensed Processes sold by such Sublicensee. In addition, if Licensee receives any fees, minimum royalties, or other payments in consideration for any rights granted under a Sublicense, and such payments are not based directly upon the amount or value of Licensed Products or Licensed Processes sold by the Sublicensee, then Licensee shall pay FSURF an amount equal to [***] of such payments for any Sublicense entered into during the first two years following the Effective Date, and an amount equal to [***] of such payments for a Sublicense entered into thereafter, of such payments in the manner specified in Section 4. Licensee shall not receive from Sublicensees anything of value in lieu of cash payments in consideration for any Sublicense under this Agreement without the express prior written permission of FSURF.                         2.2.3   Licensee shall provide FSURF with an unredacted copy of each sublicense agreement and any agreement which transfers intellectual property rights granted hereunder, at least thirty (30) days prior to the execution of the sublicense agreement and a fully executed version within thirty (30) days of execution.                         2.2.4   In the event that FSURF notifies Licensee in writing of a third party s interest in a field of use which Licensee is not addressing at the time of receipt of the notice, Licensee shall respond to FSURF in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice to inform FSURF whether Licensee intends to pursue the Field of Use. If in such response, Licensee elects to forego the Field of Use, FSURF may terminate the Licensee s license in said field and negotiate and execute said license directly.                  Section 3  Due Diligence                         3.1.1  Licensee agrees to and warrants that:                    (a)  it has, or will obtain, the expertise necessary to independently evaluate the inventions of the Licensed Patents;                         (b)  it will establish and actively and diligently pursue the Development Plan (see Appendix B) to the end that the inventions of the Licensed Patents will be utilized to provide Licensed Products and/or Licensed Processes for sale in the retail market within the Licensed Field;                         (c)  it will diligently develop markets for Licensed Products and Licensed Processes; and                         (d)  until the date of first commercial sale of Licensed Products or Licensed Processes, it will supply FSURF with a written Development Report annually fifteen (15) days after the end of the calendar year (see Appendix C).                       3.1.2  Licensee agrees that the first commercial sale of products to the retail customer shall occur on or before [***] or FSURF shall have the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 hereto. In addition, Licensee agrees to pay the product development milestone payments listed in Section 4.3.3 and to complete the due diligence activities listed in Appendix E or FSURF shall have the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3. Licensee will notify FSURF in writing as each milestone or due diligence activity is met.                         3.1.3   Licensee may issue a written request to negotiate extensions of individual milestones listed in Section 4.3.3 or due dates for individual due diligence activities listed in Appendix E. Provided that such requests are received by FSURF no less than ninety (90) days prior to the original due date in the case of milestone payments, or no less than forty five (45) days prior to the original due date in the case of due diligence activities, and that each request describes fully Licensee s diligent efforts to achieve the milestones or complete the due diligence activities, FSURF shall consider in good faith such requests. Upon granting each such request, FSURF and Licensee shall negotiate in good faith the length of the extension. FSURF shall not unreasonably withhold requests to negotiate extensions.                         3.1.4  Florida State University policies may require approval of clinical trials involving technology invented at the University. Accordingly, Licensee will notify FSURF prior to commencing any clinical trials at Florida State University or its affiliated medical facilities.                  Section 4  Payments                    4.1  Obligation in Lieu of License Issue Fee (Alternative Fee).                                In lieu of a license issue fee, in the case of a Liquidation Event after the Effective Date, Licensee agrees to pay to FSURF an amount equal to [***] of the transaction value ascribed to those assets, products, and properties related to or stemming from the licensed technology defined in the Agreement (the  Alternative Fee ). Payment of the Alternative Fee shall be due thirty (30) days following the closing of such Liquidation Event.                            4.2     Royalty.                                 Licensee agrees to pay to FSURF as earned royalties a royalty calculated as a percentage of Net Sales from the sale of Licensed Product and/or Licensed Process. The royalty is deemed earned as of the earlier of the date the Licensed Product and/or Licensed Process is actually sold and paid for, the date an invoice is sent by Licensee or its Sublicensee(s), or the date a Licensed Product and/or Licensed Process is transferred to a third party for any promotional reasons. The royalty shall remain fixed while this Agreement is in effect at a rate of [***] of Net Sales.                            4.3    Other Payments.                      4.3.1   Licensee agrees to pay FSURF maintenance fees according to the schedule below upon each anniversary of the Effective Date.                  Payment    [***]             $ [***]    [***]             $ [***]    [***]             $ [***]    [***]              $ [***]     [***]              $ [***]    [***] and every [***] thereafter on the same date, for the life of this Agreement.                          4.3.2   Upon the first quarter that sales are made, the maintenance fee shall no longer be required, and minimum royalty payments shall be made according to the schedule below and shall be creditable against royalties.                     Payment    [***]           $ [***]    [***]           $ [***]    [***]           $ [***]    [***]           $ [***]    [***] and every [***] thereafter on the same date, for the life of this Agreement.                            Upon the first quarter following the quarter in which commercial sales of the applicable Licensed Product and/or Licensed Process begin, the above minimum royalties shall be paid on a quarterly basis, with such amounts due within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar quarter, such calendar quarters ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. Any minimum royalty paid in a calendar year will be credited against the earned royalties for that calendar year. Any earned royalties paid in a calendar year will be credited against the minimum royalties due for said calendar year. It is understood that earned royalties will be applied against minimum royalties on a calendar year basis, and that sales of Licensed Products and/or Licensed Processes requiring the payment of earned royalties made during a prior or subsequent calendar year shall have no effect on the annual minimum royalty due FSURF for other than the same calendar year in which the royalties were earned.                            4.3.3  In addition to all other payments required under this Agreement, Licensee agrees to pay FSURF milestone payments, as follows:                                Milestone payments for the first product:                                 [***]  upon the earlier of (a) the [***], or (b) [***] anniversary of the date of this license.     [***]  upon the earlier of (a) [***], or (b) [***] anniversary of the Effective Date.      [***]  upon the [***].     [***]  upon filing of the [***].     [***]  within [***] after the [***].                                 Milestones payments for each additional product:                                 [***]  upon [***].      [***]  upon [***]     [***]  within [***] after the [***].                     4.4  Accounting for Payments.                    4.4.1   Amounts owing to FSURF under Sections 4.1 and 4.2 shall be paid on a quarterly basis after the amount of minimum royalties paid is exceeded, with such amounts due and received by FSURF on or before the thirtieth day following the end of the calendar quarter ending on March 31, June 30, September 30 or December 31 in which such amounts were earned. Any amounts which remain unpaid after the date they are due to FSURF shall accrue interest from the due date at the rate of [***]. However, in no event shall this interest provision be construed as a grant of permission for any payment delays. Licensee shall also be responsible for repayment to FSURF of any attorney, collection agency, or other out-of-pocket FSURF expenses required to collect overdue payments due from this Section or any other applicable section of this Agreement.                           4.4.2    Except as otherwise directed, all amounts owing to FSURF under this Agreement shall be paid in U.S. dollars to FSURF at the following address:                                  President  Florida State University Research Foundation, Inc.  Attn: Gary K. Ostrander   2000 Levy Avenue, Suite 351  Tallahassee, FL 32310     All royalties owing with respect to Net Sales stated in currencies other than U.S. dollars shall be converted at the rate shown in the Federal Reserve Noon Valuation - Value of Foreign Currencies on the day preceding the payment due date.                          4.4.3     A certified full accounting statement showing how any amounts payable to FSURF under Section 4.3 have been calculated shall be submitted to FSURF on the date of each such payment. In addition to being certified, such accounting statements shall contain a written representation signed by an executive officer of Licensee that states that the statements are true, accurate, and fairly represent all amounts payable to FSURF pursuant to this Agreement. Such accounting shall be on a per-country and product line, model or trade name basis and shall be summarized on the form shown in Appendix D   FSURF Royalty Report of this Agreement.                             4.4.4    FSURF is exempt from paying income taxes under U.S. law. Therefore, all payments due under this Agreement shall be made without deduction for taxes, assessments, or other charges of any kind which may be imposed on FSURF by any government outside of the United States or any political subdivision of such government with respect to any amounts payable to FSURF pursuant to this Agreement. All such taxes, assessments, or other charges shall be assumed by Licensee.           Section 5  Certain Warranties and Disclaimers of FSURF                   5.1  FSURF warrants that, except as otherwise provided under Section 17.1 of this Agreement and the Inter-Institutional Agreement attached as Appendix A, with respect to U.S. Government interests, it is the co-owner of the Licensed Patents or otherwise has the right to grant the licenses granted to Licensee in this Agreement. However, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as:                    5.1.1   a warranty or representation by FSURF as to the validity or scope of any right included in the Licensed Patents;                         5.1.2   a warranty or representation that anything made, used, sold or otherwise disposed of under the license granted in this Agreement will or will not infringe patents of third parties;                         5.1.3  an obligation to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for infringement of Licensed Patents;                         5.1.4  an obligation to furnish any know-how not provided in Licensed Patents or any services other than those specified in this Agreement; or                         5.1.5   a warranty or representation by FSURF that it will not grant licenses to others to make, use or sell products not covered by the claims of the Licensed Patents which may be similar and/or compete with products made or sold by Licensee.                        5.2  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, FSURF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND VALIDITY OF LICENSED PATENTS CLAIMS, ISSUED OR PENDING. FSURF ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO USE, SALE, OR OTHER DISPOSITION BY LICENSEE, ITS SUBLICENSEE(S), OR THEIR VENDEES OR OTHER TRANSFEREES OF PRODUCT INCORPORATING OR MADE BY USE OF INVENTIONS LICENSED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.                Section 6  Record Keeping                   6.1  Licensee and its Sublicensee(s) shall keep books and records sufficient to verify the accuracy and completeness of Licensee s and its Sublicensee(s) s accounting referred to above, including without limitation, inventory, purchase and invoice records, manufacturing records, sales analysis, general ledgers, financial statements, and tax returns relating to the Licensed Products and/or Licensed Processes. Such books and records shall be preserved for a period not less than six years after they are created or as required by federal law, both during and after the term of this Agreement.                         6.2  Licensee and its Sublicensee(s) shall take all steps necessary so that FSURF may, within thirty (30) days of its written request, audit, review and/or copy all of the books and records at a single U.S. location to verify the accuracy of Licensee s and its Sublicensee(s) s accounting. Such review may be performed by any authorized employees of FSURF as well as by any attorneys and/or accountants designated by FSURF, upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours. If a deficiency with regard to any payment hereunder is determined, Licensee and its Sublicensee(s) shall pay the deficiency within thirty (30) days of receiving notice thereof along with applicable interest as described in Section 4.4.1. If a royalty payment deficiency for a calendar year exceeds [***] of the royalties paid for that year, then Licensee and its Sublicensee(s) shall be responsible for paying FSURF s out-of-pocket expenses incurred with respect to such review.                         6.3  At any time during the term of this agreement, FSURF may request in writing that Licensee verify the calculation of any past payments owed to FSURF through the means of a self-audit. Within ninety (90) days of the request, Licensee shall complete a self-audit of its books and records to verify the accuracy and completeness of the payments owed. Within thirty (30) days of the completion of the self-audit, Licensee shall submit to FSURF a report detailing the findings of the self-audit and the manner in which it was conducted in order to verify the accuracy and completeness of the payments owed. If Licensee has determined through its self-audit that there is any payment deficiency, Licensee shall pay FSURF the deficiency along with applicable interest under Section 4.4.1 with the submission of the self-audit report to FSURF.           Section 7  Patent Prosecution                   7.1  FSURF shall diligently prosecute and maintain the Licensed Patents using counsel of its choice. FSURF shall provide Licensee with copies of all patent applications amendments, and other filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices. FSURF will also provide Licensee with copies of office actions and other communications received by FSURF from the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices relating to Licensed Patents. Licensee agrees to keep such information confidential.                          7.2  Licensee shall pay to FSURF the sum of [***], within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date to reimburse any and all expenses associated with preparation, filing, prosecution, issuance, maintenance, defense, and reporting of the Licensed Patents incurred prior to the Effective Date. (NOTE: the above referenced dollar amount in this Section 7.2 is subject to change, as all related patent prosecution expense invoices may not have been received from the law firm at the time of license terms negotiation. In addition, the amounts in this article are separate from other amounts due for payment listed elsewhere.)                       7.3  Licensee shall be responsible for and pay all costs and expenses incurred by FSURF related to the preparation, filing, prosecution, issuance, maintenance, defense and reporting of the Licensed Patents subsequent to and separate of those expenses cited in Section 7.2 within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from FSURF. It shall be the responsibility of Licensee to keep FSURF fully apprised of the  small entity  status of Licensee and all Sublicensees with respect to the U.S. patent laws and with respect to the patent laws of any other countries, if applicable, and to inform FSURF of any changes in writing of such status, within thirty (30) days of any such change. In the event that additional licenses are granted to licensees for alternate fields-of-use, patent expenses associated with Licensed Patents will be divided proportionally between the number of existing licensees. In the case of foreign patent protection, if a licensee declines to reimburse FSURF for its proportional share of patent expenses in any particular country, then said licensee relinquishes the right to commercialize Licensed Products in the specified country.         Section 8  Infringement and Invalidity                   8.1  In the event that any Licensed Patents are infringed by a third party, Licensor and joint owners of the Licensed Patents (subject to and as described in the Inter-Institutional Agreement attached as Appendix A) shall have the first right and choice, but not obligation, to defend the Licensed Patents. Licensee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend the Licensed Patents after Licensor and joint owners elect not to commence a suit either by formal notice to Licensee or by failure to act within the ninety (90) day period following notification of the infringer, to institute, prosecute and control any action or proceeding with respect to such infringement, by counsel of its choice, including any declaratory judgment action arising from such infringement provided, however, prior to instituting such action, Licensee shall first meet with FSURF and provide FSURF with (i) a written estimate of the expenses that would reasonably be incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and (ii) financial records reasonably sufficient to reasonably demonstrate that it has the financial wherewithal to pay such expenses as they fall due through the conclusion of such action or proceeding by means of judgment or other final, non-appealable decision or a plan to raise such funds. In the event that any Patent Rights licensed to Licensee are infringed by a third party prior to Licensee filing an investigational new drug application ( IND ) for a Licensed Product, prior to any enforcement action being taken by either FSURF or Licensee regarding such infringement, FSURF and Licensee shall discuss, and will mutually agree, in writing, as to how to handle such infringement by such third party. Licensee shall be free to enter into a settlement, consent judgment, or other voluntary disposition with respect to any such action, provided that any settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary disposition thereof which (i) materially limits the scope, validity, or enforceability of patents included in the Patent Rights or (ii) admits fault or wrongdoing on the part of FSURF must be approved by FSURF, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Licensee s request for such approval shall include complete copies of final settlement documents, a detailed summary of such settlement, and any other information material to such settlement. FSURF shall provide Licensee notice of its approval or denial within fifteen (15) business days of any request for such approval by Licensee, provided that (i) in the event FSURF wishes to deny such approval, such notice shall include a detailed written description of FSURF s reasonable objections to the proposed settlement, consent judgment, or other voluntary disposition and (ii) FSURF shall be deemed to have approved of such proposed settlement, consent judgment, or other voluntary disposition in the event it fails to provide such notice within such fifteen (15) day period in accordance herewith. If Licensee recovers monetary damages in the form of lost profits from a third party infringer as a remedy for the infringement of Patent Rights licensed hereunder, then Licensee shall first apply such recovery to the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining or negotiating for such recovery (including attorneys  fees) and reimburse FSURF for the costs and expenses it reasonably incurred in obtaining or negotiating for such recovery (including attorneys  fees), and pay to FSURF the royalties on the remaining portion of such lost profits at the rate specified in Section 4.2. If Licensee recovers monetary damages in the form of a reasonable royalty as a remedy for the infringement of Patent Rights, then, after applying such royalty to the recovery of the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining or negotiating for such royalty (including attorneys  fees) and reimbursing FSURF for the costs and expenses it reasonably incurred in obtaining or negotiating for such recovery (including attorneys  fees), the remaining amount of any such royalty shall be treated as Sublicensing Royalty Revenue in accordance with Section 2.2.2.                         8.2  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in FSURF s sole discretion, FSURF shall be entitled to participate through counsel of its own choosing in any legal action involving the invention and Patent Rights. Nothing in the foregoing Sections shall be construed in any way which would limit the authority of the Florida Attorney General. FSURF and Licensee agree to notify each other promptly of each infringement or possible infringement of Licensed Patents, as well as any facts which may affect the validity, scope or enforceability of the patent rights of which any party becomes aware.                 Section 9  Term and Termination                   9.1  The term of this license shall begin on the Effective Date of this Agreement and continue until the date that no Licensed Patent remains an enforceable patent, unless earlier terminated as provided herein.                         9.2  Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving at least sixty (60) days written notice of such termination to FSURF. Such a notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for termination.                         9.3  FSURF may terminate this Agreement by giving Licensee at least thirty (30) days written notice if Licensee:                      9.3.1  is delinquent on any report or payment;                         9.3.2   is not diligently developing and commercializing Licensed Product and Licensed Process;                         9.3.3   is in breach of any provision;                         9.3.4   provides any false report;                         9.3.5  goes into bankruptcy, liquidation or proposes having a receiver control any assets;                         9.3.6  violates any laws or regulations of applicable government entities;                         9.3.6  shall cease to carry on its business pertaining to Licensed Patents; or                         9.3.8  fails for more than two (2) calendar quarters to make payments of earned royalties under Section 4.2.                           Termination under this Section 9.3 will take effect thirty (30) days after written notice by FSURF unless Licensee remedies the problem in that 30-day period.                                   9.4  FSURF may immediately terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence of the second separate default by Licensee within any consecutive three-year period for failure to pay royalties, patent or any other expenses when due.                         9.5  Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, nothing herein shall be construed to release either party from any obligation that matured prior to the effective date of such termination. Licensee shall remain obligated to provide an accounting for and to pay royalties earned to the date of termination, and any minimum royalties shall be prorated as of the date of termination by the number of days elapsed in the applicable calendar year. Licensee may, however, after the effective date of such termination, sell all Licensed Products, and complete Licensed Products in the process of manufacture at the time of such termination and sell the same, provided that Licensee shall remain obligated to provide an accounting for and to pay running royalties thereon.                         9.6  Licensee shall be obligated to deliver to FSURF, within ninety (90) days of the date of termination of this agreement, complete and unredacted copies of all documentation prepared for or submitted for all regulatory approvals of Licensed Products or Licensed Processes.           Section 10  Assignability                   This Agreement may not be transferred or assigned by Licensee except with the prior written consent of FSURF, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Licensee may, on written notice to FSURF and with FSURF s consent, assign this Agreement to an acquirer of all or substantially all of Licensee's stock or assets, in which case assignee assumes all responsibilities under this license, however Licensee shall not be released of its obligations that matured prior to assignment.         Section 11  Dispute Resolution Procedures                   11.1  Mandatory Procedures.                               In the event either party intends to file a lawsuit against the other with respect to any matter in connection with this Agreement, compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section shall be a condition precedent to the filing of such lawsuit, other than for injunctive relief. Either party may terminate this Agreement as provided in this Agreement without following the procedures set forth in this section.                             11.1.1   When a party intends to invoke the procedures set forth in this section, written notice shall be provided to the other party. Within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice, the parties agree that representatives designated by the parties shall meet at mutually agreeable times and engage in good faith negotiations at a mutually convenient location to resolve such dispute.                         11.1.2   If the parties fail to meet within the time period set forth in Section 11.1.1 above or if either party subsequently determines that negotiations between the representatives of the parties are at an impasse, the party declaring that the negotiations are at an impasse shall give notice to the other party stating with particularity the issues that remain in dispute.                         11.1.3   Not more than fifteen (15) days after the giving of such notice of issues, each party shall deliver to the other party a list of the names and addresses of at least three individuals, any one of whom would be acceptable as a neutral advisor in the dispute (the  Neutral Advisor ) to the party delivering the list. Any individual proposed as a Neutral Advisor shall have experience in determining, mediating, evaluating, or trying intellectual property litigation and shall not be affiliated with the party that is proposing such individual.                         11.1.4  Within ten (10) days after delivery of such lists, the parties shall agree on a Neutral Advisor. If they are unable to so agree within that time, within five (5) days, they shall each select one individual from the lists. Within five (5) days, the individuals so selected shall meet and appoint a third individual from the lists to serve as the Neutral Advisor. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of a Neutral Advisor:                       (a)  The parties shall each provide a written statement of the issues in dispute to the Neutral Advisor.                         (b)  The parties shall meet with the Neutral Advisor in Tallahassee, Florida on a date and time established by the Neutral Advisor. The meeting must be attended by persons authorized to make final decisions on behalf of each party with respect to the dispute. At the meeting, each party shall make a presentation with respect to its position concerning the dispute. The Neutral Advisor will then discuss the issues separately with each party and attempt to resolve all issues in the dispute. At the meeting, the parties will enter into a written settlement agreement with respect to all issues that are resolved. Such settlement agreement shall be final and binding with respect to such resolved issues and may not be the subject of any lawsuit between the parties, other than a suit for enforcement of the settlement agreement.                     11.1.5   The expenses of the Neutral Advisor shall be shared by the parties equally. All other out-of-pocket costs and expenses for the alternative dispute resolution procedure required under this Section shall be paid by the party incurring the same.                         11.1.6   Positions taken and statements made during this alternative dispute resolution procedure shall be deemed settlement negotiations and shall not be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding.                         11.2   Failure to Resolve Dispute.                                If any issue is not resolved at the meeting with the Neutral Advisor, either party may file appropriate administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the issue that remains in dispute. No new issues may be included in the lawsuit without the mandatory procedures set forth in this section having first been followed.                     11.3   If Licensee or any of its Affiliates (i) brings a Patent Challenge against FSURF, or (ii) Licensee or any of its Affiliates assists another party in bringing a Patent Challenge against FSURF (except as required under a court order or subpoena), and (iii) FSURF does not choose to exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 then, in the event that such a Patent Challenge is successful, Licensee will have no right to recoup any consideration, including royalties, paid during the period of challenge. In the event that a Patent Challenge is unsuccessful, Licensee shall reimburse FSURF for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in its defense against the Patent Challenge.         Section 12  Product Liability; Conduct of Business                   12.1  Licensee and its Sublicensee(s) shall, at all times during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, indemnify, defend and hold FSURF, the Florida Board of Governors, the Florida State University Board of Trustees, Florida State University, JHU, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, The Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (HHS) and each of their directors, officers, employees, and agents, and the inventors of the Licensed Patents  Indemnitees , regardless of whether such inventors are employed by Florida State University, and/or HHS, and/or JHU at the time of the claim, harmless against all claims and expenses, including legal expenses and reasonable attorneys  fees, whether arising from a third party claim or resulting from FSURF s enforcing this indemnification clause against Licensee, arising out of the death of or injury to any person or persons or out of any damage to property and against any other claim, proceeding, demand, expense and liability of any kind whatsoever (other than patent infringement claims) resulting from the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption, marketing, or advertisement of Licensed Products or Licensed Process(es) or arising from any right or obligation of Licensee hereunder.

FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC.      _____________________________________ Date: _______________, 2016  Gary K. Ostrander  President, Florida State University Research Foundation      LICENSEE      By: ___________________________________ Date: ____________, 2016     Name and Office: _____________________________________________              Appendix A - Inter-institutional Agreement                                                                 Appendix B - Development Plan       The starting point for the Development Plan will be the group of compounds previously identified by Prof. Hengli Tang and collaborators and described in Provisional Patent Application [***]. Novel compounds (prodrugs or other derivatives) will be synthesized with the aim of optimizing characteristics such as oral bioavailability, CNS penetration, pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, and safety. The ultimate goals of the Development Program are to complete preclinical and clinical testing of one or more lead drug candidates, prepare and file a New Drug Application, obtain marketing approval, and commence product manufacturing and sales.                 A.  Development activities to be undertaken                                (Please break activities into subunits)                     1.   Testing of lead compounds in small animal and human brain organoid model for ZIKV inhibition . We will test the efficacy of lead compounds in both IFNAR-/- mice and C57BL/6 mice. Multiple assays, including body weight loss, lethality, and viral load in blood and tissues, will be used to determine if a compound is effective against ZIKV infection. We will also use the human brain organoid system as a complementary model to avoid pitfalls of species-specific differences and safeguard the success of our project.                         2.   Determination of mechanism of action (this project is concurrent with other activities and not part of a sequence of activities) . We will use a combined approach of biochemistry, molecular biology, and virology to identify the compound target and dissect its mechanism of action (MOA). We will label the compound and identify its binding partner in cells and in vitro; we will map any drug resistant mutations in cell culture and determine the specific steps of the virus life cycle to which the compound targets.                         3.   Optimization of lead compounds in each class.  For both classes of compounds, we will perform iterative rounds of analog synthesis and testing, typically on a biweekly or monthly schedule. The chemistry team will design and synthesize compounds; the biology team will test the compounds in assays; and the Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) team will evaluate compound physical properties. During lead optimization, it is necessary to address ADME and toxicological liabilities and to improve the lead compound s DMPK properties. The goal lead optimization is to identify an advanced lead candidate with drug-like properties, efficacy in animal models, and low toxicity.                         4.   Advanced safety testing for lead candidates . Once advanced lead candidates are identified, we will begin to build a safety package for the compound. This in general will consist of non-GLP toxicology studies in a rodent and a non-rodent species. Upon successful completion of the exploratory toxicology studies, we will manufacture sufficient amounts of application program interface (API) under GMP conditions to support GLP toxicology studies in two species under GLP conditions, including GLP genotoxicity and safety pharmacology studies under GLP conditions. The results from these studies will form the body of the regulatory filing to open an IND with the FDA.                       B.  Estimated total development time        II.
