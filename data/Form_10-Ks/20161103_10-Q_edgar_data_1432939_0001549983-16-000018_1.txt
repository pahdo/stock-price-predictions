NOTE
A   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Organization
and Purpose   

Credex
Corporation, (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 2, 2005. The company is looking renewable
energy and hydrogen technologies and develops new markets. The Company is currently reviewing various technologies. The Company
is also exploring avenues for raising capital in order to put its business plan into effect. The Company s principal office
is in Las Vegas, Nevada.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all information and footnote
disclosures required for an annual set of financial statements prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles.
In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 and for all interim periods
presented herein have been reflected in these financial statements and the notes there to. Interim results for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes as included in the Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Accounting
Basis   

The
Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP 
accounting).  The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.  

Cash
and Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less
than three months to be cash equivalents.  

Financial
Instruments   

Financial
instruments consist of accounts payable and loans from related parties. The carrying amount of financial instruments approximates
fair value due to short-term maturities and market interest rates.  

Advertising   

The
Company expenses advertising and promotions costs as they are incurred.

   September

NOTE
A   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes
it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.  

Earnings
per Share   

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
stock shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential dilutive instruments such as stock options
and warrants. The Company has no dilutive instruments outstanding.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns.  

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ) which addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The
Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section
740-10-25.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option
plan and has not granted any stock options.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE
A   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Comprehensive
Income   

The
Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated
balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders  Equity.
Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The
Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive
income.    

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a
development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these
amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented
inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  ASU  2014-15 on  Presentation of Financial Statements
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern .
Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments
in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by
incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments
(1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods,
(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and
other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to
determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.   

NOTE
B   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company s
financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
has sustained losses of $347,329 since inception to September 30, 2016. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon expanding operations and obtaining additional capital and financing. Management s plan in this regard
is to implement the Company s business plan and to secure additional funds through equity or debt financing. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE
D   CAPITAL STOCK   

At
inception on September 2, 2005, the Company was authorized to have outstanding 10,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 par value
per share. On October 24, 2007, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the maximum number of authorized
common shares to 100,000,000 and changed the par value to $0.001 per share, which has been retro-actively restated to $0.001 in
the accompanying financial statements.  

On
September 13, 2013, the Company received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) clearing
a ten to one (10:1) forward stock split previously approved by the Company s board of directors. The record Date for the
forward stock split is September 16, 2013 which resulted in an increase in the number of shares issued and outstanding from 5,899,250
to 58,992,500 shares. All reference to shares and per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively
restated to reflect the aforementioned forward stock split.  

There
were 58,992,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

In
accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company    has analyzed its operations subsequent to September

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and the related notes, and other financial information contained in this prospectus.  

Overview   

We
are a start up company. Although Credex has not operated pursuant to its business plan, in 2005 Credex purchased a portfolio of
defaulted credit card debt to test the feasibility of its business plan. On a trial basis accounts from the portfolio were collected.
The remainder of the portfolio was then sold. Our auditors have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. We need a minimum of approximately $100,000 during the next 12 months to begin implementation of our business plan.  

We
are a start up company with no revenues or operating history. Our address is 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, Nevada 89107.
The telephone number is 801-243-5661. While our address is in Nevada, our sole officer and director currently operates our business
from Utah without an office and through the use of phone and email.  

Since
our inception, we have devoted our activities to the following:  

(1)
Purchasing a debt portfolio;  

(2)
Obtaining bids from professional collectors to collect the portfolio;  

(3)
Developing contacts from whom to purchase portfolios;  

(4)
Contracting for operational support; and  

(5)
Securing enough capital to carry out these activities.  

Item
2.A  S-1 Withdrawal   

On
May 20, 2014, the Company filed Form RW, registration Withdrawal Request SEC Accession No. 0001549983-14-000015, withdrawing
the previous S-1.  At this time the Company has no active,  open, or pending offerings.  

Plan
of Operations   

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Lack
of Revenues   

We
have limited operational history. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we did not generate any revenues. We anticipate
that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months
continues to be uncertain.  

Operating
Expenses    

The

Office   

Credex s
executive office is located at 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, NV 89107. The telephone number is (801) 243-5661.  

Credex
is not operating its business plan until such time as capital is raised for operations. To date its operation has involved only
selling stock to meet expenses.  

Business
Overview   

Credex,
a Florida corporation, was formed on September 2, 2005. The Company was formed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds
for purchasing, servicing, managing and reselling of non-performing (defaulted) unsecured credit card debt portfolios to be acquired
from financial institutions and distressed debt wholesalers. Since its inception, the Company derived no revenues and no income
from such business and as result as of September 30, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $347,329.  

We
are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history. Our address is 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, Nevada
89107. The telephone number is 801-243-5661. While our address is in Nevada, our sole officer and director currently operate our
business from Utah without an office and through the use of phone and email.  

The
Company has attempted to attract private placement investments in the past. Thus far, the Company has not been able to implement
its plans or begin operations because it has not been successful in raising the equity capital necessary to implement such plans.  

There
is no current public market for our securities. As our stock is not publicly traded, investors should be aware they probably will
be unable to sell their shares and their investment in our securities is not liquid.  

At
the present time, we are classified as a  shell company  under Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on Rule
144 until: (1) we file Form 10 information with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) when we cease to be
a  shell company  (2) we have filed all reports as required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for twelve
consecutive months; and (3) one year has elapsed from the time we file the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting
our status as an entity that is not a shell company.  

Bankruptcy
Or Similar Proceedings   

There
has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding involving the Company.  

Reorganization,
Purchase Or Sale Of Assets   

Other
than the acquisition of the patent, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale
of a significant amount of assets involving the Company.  

Effect
Of Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The Business   

The
Company will be subject to numerous national, international, regional, state and local laws. The Company does not know when or
whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned
to be provided by the Company or which the Company intends to develop. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the effect, if
any, that any such future regulation may have on its business.  

Research
And Development Activities During The Last Two Years   

We
have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.  

Costs
And Effects Of Compliance With Environmental Laws   

We
don t anticipate material costs or expenses related to compliance with environmental laws. Hydrogen is a clean energy sector
and there may be some tax incentives associated with this sector.  

Number
Of Total Employees And Number Of Full Time Employees   

We
currently have one employee, our executive officer, Russell Heaton. He devotes five (5) hours per week, to our business and
currently is responsible for our general strategy, fund raising and customer relations. Once the offering is complete we will
hire additional staff if we generate enough revenue to support the expense. The number of additional staff will depend upon
our growth.

4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company handles all aspects of the company. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2016 due to the Company s small size and a lack of segregation of duties.   

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and implemented by
the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  

The
Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material impact on the financial
statements.  

The
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures, or the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, will necessarily prevent
all fraud and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, the Company s internal control system can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
The design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or because the degree
of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.  

Management
of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 and determined that controls are ineffective
due to the Company s small size and lack of segregation of duties.  

This
report does not include an attestation report by our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting.  Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only our management report in this report.  

PART
II.  OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1.  Legal Proceedings.   

Credex
is not involved in any litigation or any material legal proceeding.  No Officer or Director is involved in any litigation
or any material legal proceeding.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the
other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business,
operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade
at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS   

We
are a development stage company and have no operating history. An investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and
could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plan.    

Credex
was incorporated on September 2, 2005 and we have not yet commenced any business operations. Until we are actually in the marketplace
for a demonstrable period of time, it is impossible to determine if our business strategy will be viable or successful. Any such
failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans to continue
business operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering.  

Because
our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which
case you could lose your investment.    

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion because of the Company s losses, limited working capital and the absence of
any current revenue-generating operations. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business
for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about
our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment.  

We
cannot predict when or if we will produce revenues, which could result in a total loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful
in our business plans.    

We
have not yet implemented our business plan or offered our services. Therefore, we have not yet generated any revenues from operations.
In order for us to continue with our plans and open our business, we must raise our initial capital to do so through this offering.
The timing of the completion needed to commence operations and generate revenues is contingent on the success of this offering.
There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain our business. As a result,
you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed
business plans.  

Our
business will be dependent on our ability to sell hydrogen units. If we are unable to sell and secure more technology our business
will be adversely affected.    

If
we are unable to develop and sell, we may not be able to execute our business plan. We have no agreements of any kind at this
time. If we are unable to secure and retain new agreements our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected. We also cannot provide assurances that if we are able to establish such agreements that
we will be able to maintain these agreements, on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
success depends, in significant part, on global and regional demand and any factors that may have an adverse effect on such markets
could have a material adverse effect on our proposed business, financial condition and results of operations.    

Our
plan is to find a merger candidate or opportunity in the hydrogen sector . Accordingly, our business, financial condition and
results of operations will be directly affected by the demand for our products. Demand is subject to fluctuation, and adverse
trends in the market could adversely affect our business. In addition, general economic conditions, consumer trends, energy prices,
work stoppages, natural disasters and terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business. A protracted global recession
could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.  

The
hydrogen industry is highly competitive, which could adversely affect the company s financial performance.    

The
hydrogen industry is highly competitive. We will face significant competition from established national, regional and local providers.
There can be no assurance that if we are able to establish our business that will be able to compete successfully in the future
with existing or potential competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on its business and financial condition.  

We
may not be able to adapt our business quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards.    

The
Hydrogen industry is characterized by evolving industry standards, frequent production enhancements and changing customer demands.
We may not be able to adapt quickly enough and/or in a cost-effective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements
and preferences, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business. We may be unable to devote financial resources
to new technologies and systems in the future. Any failure on our part to modify or adapt to these trends could render our business
competitively disadvantaged, which could adversely affect our business.  

Any
failure to comply with existing laws, rules and regulations as well as changing laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties,
could adversely affect our business.    

We
will be subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions, which are
subject to change at any time. For example, those laws, rules and regulations relating to energy.  

Our
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies
and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the promulgation
of new laws, rules and regulations that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we plan to operate
and may require us to change certain aspects of our business plans to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for Hydrogen,
reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.  

We
may need to obtain additional financing if we fail to generate revenue in the anticipated timeframe. If we do not obtain such
financing, we may have to reduce or cease our activities and investors could lose their entire investment.    

Our
business plan will be funded by public offering, but that there is no guarantee that any amount will be raised. Even if we are
successful, there is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future. We may require
additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in receiving revenues at the levels we anticipate.
We currently do not have any arrangements for further, and we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms
or terms that are acceptable to us or on any terms at all. Because of the worldwide economic downturn or because of other reasons,
we may not be able to raise any additional funds that we require on favorable terms, if any. The failure to obtain necessary financing,
if needed, may impair our ability to continue in business.  

You
may suffer significant dilution if we raise additional capital.    

If
we raise additional capital, we expect it will be necessary for us to issue additional equity or convertible debt securities.
If we issue equity or convertible debt securities, the price at which we offer such securities may not bear any relationship to
our value, the net tangible book value per share may decrease, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders would be diluted,
and any equity securities we issue in such offering or upon conversion of convertible debt securities issued in such offering,
may have rights, preferences or privileges with respect to liquidation, dividends, redemption, voting and other matters that are
senior to or more advantageous than our common stock.  

If
we obtain debt financing, we will face risks associated with financing our operations.    

If
we obtain debt financing, we will be subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash
flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that we will not be able to renew,
repay, or refinance our debt when it matures or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing
terms of that debt. If we enter into secured lending facilities and are unable to pay our obligations to our secured lenders,
they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them or our other assets including the funds
in the escrow account.  

Our
success is dependent on a limited number of key executives and other third party advisors.    

The
success of our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management
team and the services of other third party advisors. The loss of the services of one or more of these key parties could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to retain our existing senior management, attract additional qualified executives or joint venture partners or adequately
fill new senior management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. We do not have employment agreements with
our senior management team and we do not maintain key-person life insurance policies on their lives. The loss of any of our senior
management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.  

We
have no experience in the Hydrogen industry.    

Credex
does not have substantial Hydrogen industry experience or financial resources. With such a lack of experience there can be no
assurance that we will ever generate revenues or operate a successful business. As a result, you could lose all of your investment
if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans  

Mr.
Heaton, the sole officer and director of the company, currently devotes approximately five (5) hours per week to company matters.
The company s needs could exceed the amount of time or level he may have. this could result in a conflict of interest and
his inability to properly manage company affairs, resulting in our remaining a start-up company.    

We
have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with Mr. Heaton s other business activities. In
the event he is unable to fulfill any aspect of his duties to the Company or we are required to search for a replacement for Mr.
Heaton we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of our business.  

Our
management has no experience in a public company setting. Management decisions and choices may not take into account standard
operating procedures required for a public company. as a result, we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result
in the loss of your investment.    

Mr.
Heaton, our sole officer and director, has no experience as the principal executive officer or principal financial officer of
a public company. Consequently our activities, earnings and ultimate success could suffer irreparable harm due to management s
lack of experience. As a result we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result in the loss of your investment.  

Potential
liability could cause Credex to go out of business  .  

The
Company s intended operations and both the activities of the Company could expose it to potential liability for which it
may not be able to secure adequate levels of insurance. If the Company is found to be liable, it may not be able to continue in
business.  

We
may fail to adhere to SEC filing requirements  .  

Adherence
to securities laws, regulations and standards require substantial legal and financial expertise and compliance costs. If our efforts
to comply with securities, laws, regulations and standards, investors may not receive key information on a timely basis and regulatory
authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.
