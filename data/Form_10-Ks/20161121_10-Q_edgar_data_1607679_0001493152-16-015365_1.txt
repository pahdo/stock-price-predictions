 September 30, 2016 and 2015 

1.) Nature of the Business and Going
Concern  

Algae Dynamics Corp. (the  Company )
was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on October 7, 2008 as Converted Carbon of Canada Corp. On November
19, 2010, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Converted Carbon Technologies Corp. and a further
amendment was approved by the shareholders on August 28, 2014 to change the name to Algae Dynamics Corp. 

The Company is a nutrient ingredient
company and has developed a scalable Pure-BioSilo  for sanitary cultivation of microalgae targeted to the functional food
and beverage additives and supplement markets. The Company s planned principal operations are the design, engineering and
manufacturing of a proprietary algae cultivation system for the high volume production of pure contaminant-free algae biomass.
The Company is currently conducting research and development activities to operationalize certain technology currently in the allowed
patent application stage, so it can produce pure contaminate-free algae biomass. 

During the year ended March 31, 2014,
the Company secured a research facility in Mississauga, Ontario, which houses all of its employees and research and development
activities. In May 2016, the Company signed a Letter of Engagement with Midtown Partners   Co, LLC to raise additional equity
capital to support the implementation of its business plan. 

The Company filed a Form S-1 registration
Statement with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an initial registration of common shares. The registration was
declared effective by the SEC on November 21, 2014. The Company s stock began trading on September 17, 2015. 

The Company s activities are
subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to obtain patents and failing to secure additional funding to
operationalize the Company s current technology before another company develops similar technology. 

These condensed interim financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the development stage and has not yet realized profitable operations
and has relied on non-operational sources to fund operations. The Company has suffered recurring losses and additional future
losses are anticipated as the Company has not yet been able to generate revenue. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company
has a working capital deficiency of $677,356 (March 31, 2016 - $765,356) and an accumulated deficit of $4,380,135 (March
31, 2016 - $3,723,368). The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on successfully executing its
business plan, which includes the raising of additional funds. The Company will continue to seek additional forms of debt or equity
financing, but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so. These circumstances raise substantial doubt
as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of accounting
principles applicable to a going concern. The accompanying condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.

2.) Presentation of Financial Statements  

Basis of Presentation  

These unaudited condensed interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the Company s most recently completed
fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. These condensed interim financial statements do not include all disclosures required in annual
financial statements, but rather are prepared in accordance with recommendations for interim financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). These unaudited condensed
interim financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies, and methods as those used by the Company in
the annual financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016, except when disclosed below. 

The unaudited condensed interim financial
statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary to present fairly the
financial position of the Company as at September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations for the six month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Note disclosures have been presented
for material updates to the information previously reported in the annual financial statements. 

Estimates  

The preparation of these condensed
interim financial statements has required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. 

On an ongoing basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to provision for doubtful accounts, accrued liabilities and contingencies, and
the valuation of income taxes, stock based compensation, warrants, convertible debt and intangible assets. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. As adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which
they become known.

3.) Equipment and Leasehold Improvements  

During the six month period ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded total amortization of $8,712 (2015 - $8,878) which was recorded to amortization expense
on the statements of operations. 

4.) Advances from Shareholders
and Related Parties  

As at September 30, 2016, the Company
had received cumulative working capital advances in the amount of $469,056 (March 31, 2016 - $383,990) from two shareholders who
are also officers and directors of the Company. The advances from shareholders are unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable
upon demand. 

5.) Term Loan  

On May 4, 2016, the Company agreed
to a term loan of $40,000 for bridge financing with a relative of one of the officers of the Company. The loan matures on November
28, 2016 and the terms specify a 30% premium to be paid at that time. The 30% premium is recognized as an expense over the
term of the loan and is amortized on the condensed interim statements of operations. During the six month period ended September
30, 2016 the Company recorded accretion expense of $8,956 (2015 - $nil). The loan was initially scheduled to mature on August
28, 2016 but an extension of three months was agreed to with the same terms.

On April 18, 2016, the Company signed

Equity Purchase Agreement ( EPA )  

On September 10, 2015 the Company
entered into the EPA. The holder of the EPA is committed to purchase up to USD$750,000 worth of the Company s common shares
(the  Put Shares ) over the 12 month term of the EPA. The Company paid to the holder of the EPA a commitment fee for
entering into the EPA equal to 50,000 restricted common shares of the Company, valued at $67,195, based on the stock price in the
most recent private placement as the Company s shares had not yet begun to trade on a public market. 

From time to time over the EPA, commencing
on the trading day immediately following the date on which the registration statement covering the resale of the Put Shares (the
 Registration Statement ) is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ),
the Company may, in its sole discretion, draw upon the EPA periodically during the term by the Company s delivery to the
holder of the EPA, a written notice requiring the holder to purchase a dollar amount in common shares (the  Draw Down Notice ).
The shares issuable pursuant to a Draw Down Notice, when aggregated with the shares then held by the holder on the date of the
draw down may not exceed the lessor of (i) 4.99% of the Company s outstanding common shares, (ii) USD$62,500 in any 30 days
period or (iii) 100% of the aggregate trading volume for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the date of the Draw Down Notice
without the prior written consent of the holder. The purchase price per common share purchased under the EPA shall equal 65% of
the lowest closing bid for the 10 days immediately preceding the date of the Draw Down Notice. The Registration Statement was filed
with the Commission on October 1, 2015 and was declared effective by the Commission on March 3, 2016.

Equity Purchase Agreement ( EPA )
(continued)  

On June 23, 2016, the Company agreed
in conjunction with RY Capital Group, LLC and GHS Investments, LLC to assign the EPA to GHS Investments, LLC. The change made
to the EPA include increasing the share purchase price per common share to 80% from 65% of the lowest closing bid for the 10 trading
days immediately preceding the date of the draw down notice, increasing the upper limit on individual draws to USD$75,000 from
USD$62,500 and including a true-up feature whereby if the lowest volume-weighted average price ( VWAP ) for the ten
trading days following a draw down (the  Trading Period ) is less than 85% of the purchase price of the common shares
issued in connection with a draw down, then the Company shall issue such additional common shares as maybe necessary to adjust
the purchase price for such draw down to equal the VWAP during the Trading Period. See also Note 11. 

(b) Warrants   

As at September 30, 2016, the following
warrants were outstanding: 

* Subsequent to September 30, 2016, these warrants expired
unexercised. 

i)  
      In connection with a private placement offering completed during the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company granted an aggregate of 8,850 share purchase warrants each exercisable into one common share at USD$2.00 ($2.62) until November 30, 2016. The fair value of the warrants at the date of grant of $6,213 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following weighted average assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 124%; risk free interest rate of 1.02%; and expected term of 2 years.

(b) Warrants (continued)  

ii)  
      During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company also issued 27,500 warrants of the Company valued at $19,290 for services rendered of which 22,500 warrants were granted to an officer of the Company. The compensation expense has been included in professional fees on the statements of operations. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at an exercise price of $1.12 for a period ranging from 2.15 to 3 years after the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants at the date of grant of $19,290 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following weighted average assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%; risk free interest rate of 1.14%; expected volatility of 182%; and expected term of 2.85 years.   

iii)  
      In connection with the unit issuance completed October 22, 2014 in settlement of debt, the Company granted 3,350 share purchase warrants exercisable into one common share at USD$1.50 ($1.97) per share for a period of 2 years from the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants at the date of grant of $2,060 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 123%; risk free interest rate of 0.99%; and expected term of 2 years.   

For the six month period ended September
30, 2016, the Company recorded $Nil, (2015 - $Nil) as compensation expense for warrants issued to a consultant for service, net
of a market adjustment for the six months period ended September 30, 2016 of $16,042 (2015 - $Nil). The expense was recorded as
professional fees on the statements of operations. 

ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging 
indicates that warrants with exercise prices denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency should
not be classified as equity. As a result, warrants with a USD exercise price have been treated as derivatives and recorded as liabilities
carried at their fair value, with period-to-period changes in the fair value recorded as a gain or loss in the statements of operations.

6.) Capital Stock (continued)  

(b) Warrants (continued)  

The continuity of warrants for the
period ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

As at September 30, 2016, the fair
value of the 337,200 (March 31, 2016   381,700) warrants exercisable in US dollars was $156,000 (March 31, 2016 -
$222,803) which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions:
expected dividend yield of 0% (March 31, 2016 - 0%); expected volatility of 227% (March 31, 2016   150%); risk-free interest
rate of 0.52% (March 31, 2016   0.54%) and expected term of 0.49 years (March 31, 2016   0.99 years). Of this amount,
$Nil (March 31, 2016 - $27,479) was reflected as a liability as at September 30, 2016, representing the percentage of the fair
value of the warrants that is equal to the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered at September 30, 2016. 

The warrant liability is classified
as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy (See Note 10). The Company s computation of expected volatility during the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is based on the market close price of comparable public entities over the period equal to the
expected life of the warrants. The Company s computation of expected life is calculated using the contractual life. 

(c) Stock-based compensation  

The Company s stock-based compensation
program (the  Plan ) includes stock options in which some options vest based on continuous service. For those equity
awards that vest based on continuous service, compensation expense is recorded over the service period from the date of grant. 

The total number of options outstanding
as at September 30, 2016 was 930,000 (March 31, 2016   930,000). The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
during the periods ended September 30, 2016 was $n/a (2015 - $n/a). The maximum number of options that may be issued under the
Plan is floating at an amount equivalent to 15% of the issued and outstanding common shares, or 1,513,703 as at September 30, 2016
(March 31, 2016   1,455,158).

the Company for funds advanced under the employment agreement (See Note 8). The amount receivable is unsecured, non-interest bearing
and repayable upon demand. 

10.) Financial Instruments  

(a) Liquidity risk  

Liquidity risk is the risk that the
Company will not have sufficient cash resources to meet its financial obligations as they come due. The Company s liquidity
and operating results may be adversely affected if its access to the capital market is hindered, whether as a result of a downturn
in stock market conditions generally or matters specific to the Company. The Company generates cash flow primarily from its financing
activities and advances from shareholders. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $2,543 (March 31, 2016 - $173) to
settle current liabilities of $901,065 (March 31, 2016 - $809,347). All of the Company s financial liabilities other
than the warrant liability of $Nil (March 31, 2016 - $27,479) and the term loan of $48,957 (March 31, 2016 - $nil) have contractual
maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms. The Company regularly evaluates its cash position to ensure
preservation and security of capital as well as liquidity.

10.) Financial Instruments (continued)  

(a)  
  Liquidity risk (continued)   

In the normal course of business,
management considers various alternatives to ensure that the Company can meet some of its operating cash flow requirements through
financing activities, such as private placements of common stock, preferred stock offerings and offerings of debt and convertible
debt instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities. Management may also consider strategic alternatives, including
strategic investments and divestitures. As future operations may be financed out of funds generated from financing activities,
the ability to do so is dependent on, among other factors, the overall state of capital markets and investor appetite for investments
in the green technology industry and the Company s securities in particular. Should the Company elect to satisfy its cash
commitments through the issuance of securities, by way of either private placement or public offering or otherwise, there can be
no assurance that the efforts to obtain such additional funding will be successful, or achieved on terms favorable to the Company
or its existing shareholders. If adequate funds are not available on favorable terms, the Company may have to reduce substantially
or eliminate expenditures or obtain funds through other sources such as divestiture or monetization of certain assets or sublicensing
(where permitted) of certain rights to certain of the Company s technologies or products. 

(b) Concentration of credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Cash deposits with a major Canadian
chartered bank are insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000. As at September 30, 2016, the Company
held $2,543 (March 31, 2016 - $173) with a major Canadian chartered bank. 

(c)  
  Foreign exchange risk   

The Company principally operates
within Canada. The Company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and major purchases are transacted in Canadian dollars.
Management believes the foreign exchange risk derived from currency conversions is negligible and therefore does not hedge its
foreign exchange risk. See also Note 10 (e). 

(d)  
  Interest rate risk   

As at September 30, 2016, the Company
does not have any interest-bearing debt. The Company invests any cash surplus to its operational needs in investment-grade short-term
deposit certificates issued by highly rated Canadian banks. The Company periodically assesses the quality of its investments and
is satisfied with the credit rating of the bank.

(e) Derivative liability  
warrant liability  

In connection with a consulting agreement,
the Company granted warrants to purchase up to 625,000 common shares of the Company as disclosed in Note 6(b). The warrants have
an exercise price of USD$0.04 ($0.052). The warrants are exercisable at any time prior to April 1, 2017. The warrants are accounted
for as derivative liabilities because the exercise price is denominated in a currency other than the Company s functional
currency. 

In connection with the settlement
of a vendor s account, the Company granted warrants to purchase up to 3,350 common shares of the Company. The warrants have
an exercise price of USD$1.50 ($1.97). The warrants are exercisable at any time prior to October 22, 2016. The warrants are accounted
for as derivative liabilities because the exercise price is denominated in a currency other than the Company s functional
currency. 

In connection with a private placement,
the Company granted warrants to purchase up to 8,850 common shares of the Company. The warrants have an exercise price of USD$2.00
($2.62). The warrants are exercisable at any time prior to November 30, 2016. The warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities
because the exercise price is denominated in a currency other that the Company s functional currency. The table below summarizes
the fair value of the Company s financial liabilities measured at fair value:

Securities Purchase Agreement
and Convertible Note 

On November 18, 2016 (the  Note
Closing Date ), the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement dated as of the Note Closing Date (the  Purchase
Agreement ) with GHS Investments, LLC ( GHS ). The Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein, GHS shall purchase from the Company on the Closing Date a senior convertible note with a
principal amount of USD$56,000 (the  Convertible Note ) ($73,920) for a purchase price of USD$50,000 ($66,000). Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, on the Note Closing Date, the Company issued the Convertible Note to GHS. 

The Convertible Note matures
on August 18, 2017 and accrues interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The Convertible Note is convertible beginning ninety (90)
trading days after the Note Closing Date, in whole or in part, at GHS  option into common shares of the Company s
capital stock at a variable conversion price equal to a 38% discount from the lowest trading price in the twenty (20) trading
days prior to the day that GHS requests conversion. At no time will GHS be entitled to convert any portion of the Convertible
Note to the extent that after such conversion, GHS (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the
outstanding common shares, although GHS can modify this limit to 9.99% of the outstanding common shares. 

The Convertible Note includes
customary event of default provisions, and provides for a default interest rate of 20%. The Company has the right at any time
prior to May 18, 2017 to redeem all, but not less than all, of the total outstanding amount then remaining
under the Convertible Note in cash at a price   ranging from 125% to 135% of the total amount of the Convertible
Note then outstanding.

Company
Overview   

Algae
Dynamics Corp (the  Company ) is currently engaged in the commercialization of our proprietary BioSilo  algae
cultivation system for the high volume, low cost production of pure contaminant-free algae biomass. This biomass is high in Omega-3
fatty-acids EPA, DHA and DPA, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, all of which are in demand by the growing multibillion dollar
food/beverage and health care sectors. Our integrated BioSilo  manufacturing system provides low cost algae biomass production
with modest capital cost requirements compared to conventional approaches. Furthermore, our  controlled outcomes 
technology provides ultra-high purity algae biomass, differentiating it from other producers in the market. Following completion
of a commercial-scale demonstration facility we intend to produce algae biomass for sale into the functional additive and supplement
markets.  

The
Company s mission is to be a leading producer of low-cost ultra-pure algae biomass with high nutrient content for the functional
food/beverage additive and health supplement industries.  

The
global omega-3 market was estimated to be US$14.5 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach US$21.7 billion by 2019, growing at
a CAGR of 7.0% from 2014 to 2019.  

The
North American omega-3 market was estimated to be US$4.0 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach US$5.9 billion by 2019, growing
at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2014 to 2019. Supplements are the largest application segment that drives North America s omega-3
market .   

Compared
with fiber Omega-3 is the most consumed ingredient because of its wide-ranging applications in food, pharmaceuticals and dietary
supplements. Various health concerns such as obesity, cardiac failure and neural disorders are driving the consumers toward nutraceuticals
that contain omega-3 fatty acids as a main ingredient. (source: BCC Research November 2014)  

ADC
is looking to raise US$2 to $3 million to complete its BioSilo  system commercialization plan (scheduled for 8   10
months) including Business to Business  B to B  value-added product strategies. The Company is also looking to raise
US$8.0 million for Phase II to roll out larger commercial systems as part of its commercial growth strategy. ADC has a defined
plan to generate revenue by supplying algae biomass in a powder form and/or oil that can be used as nutrient rich ingredients
for its customers.  

DHA
Algae oil prices trade in the range of $60 to $90 per kilogram today depending on DHA concentration and country of origin, however,
algae oil is typically selling for $70 to $75 per kilogram. (source: Frost   Sullivan May 24 th . 2016).  

The
average price observed for Chlorella was approximately  26.83/kg (US$30.59) in 2015, in bulk form, ranging from less than
 10 (US$11.40) to more than  40 (US$45.60). Chlorella products on the upper range will be products produced from environmentally-controlled
closed systems with 3rd party-substantiated quality claims. Users of these high-end products are dietary supplement, medical food,
and personal care producers in the Western countries. (source: Frost   Sullivan August 2015)  

Product
pricing of Business to Consumer  B to C  and value-added products pricing are substantially higher than bulk sales.  

Globally,
there were 351 products containing Chlorella launched between February 2013 and April 2016: 180 in the food category; 91 in the
drink category, and 80 in the pet products category. (source: Agriculture Canada April 2016)  

The
Company intends to enter the North American market through food/beverage and health supplement distributors as well as food and
beverage manufacturers directly. Many of these companies have distribution globally which could provide Algae Dynamics access
to world markets.  

As
well the Company is developing plans   to build brand recognition,
specializing in the health food and supplement markets, to have packaged products available for sale to customers (Business to
Consumer  B to C  - online, retail and wholesale).  

The
reader is cautioned that the price data is the most recent available for the Company. While there is a risk that prices have decreased
in the meantime, we believe they are still representative of market conditions. However, even if prevailing market prices have
decreased, the lower margins could work to the Company s advantage because, as management believes, its BioSilo  process
gives it a production cost advantage over certain competing production methods, such as the more common open-pond system.  

Our
key competitive advantage is process engineering control which management believes ensures the best possible outcomes for each
algae species at a low cost. Growing algae successfully requires a blend of a controlled environment and species selection. The
Company s production flexibility and tight control allows it to interchange selected species for improved algae yield and
quality or client and marketplace demands as required. This provides an immediate and long term competitive advantage allowing
the Company to quickly and profitably enter the market as R D on species selection evolves.  

Through
its assignment of rights agreement with researchers at the University of Waterloo, the Company has access to proprietary algae
species developed in the researcher s labs that management believes have very high growth rates and nutrient content. The
design enables full control of all cultivation parameters allowing Algae Dynamics to achieve optimum growing conditions for any
algae species. As well, a unique CO 2  delivery system enhances delivery efficiency and minimizes CO 2  losses from
the system. In essence, Algae Dynamics is combining expertise in the science of algae cultivation with the efficiency of thoughtful
engineering.  

The
Company has entered into a memorandum of understanding with POS Biosciences ( POS ), a Saskatchewan, Canada based
company, for key process variables such as oil extraction and EPA/DHA separation. POS offers expertise and service in bioprocessing
applied research from bench-top to commercialization scale. CO 2  and agriculture quality nutrients are expected to be supplied
by outside suppliers which will be managed by us. Under the POS memorandum of understanding, POS will assist the Company in the
commercialization of the Company s algae strains by identifying, isolating, extracting, concentrating, spray drying and
purifying a wide range of algae-based components. POS also has in place the appropriate licenses and quality assurance standards
for food and nutraceutical products. Billing for POS services will be on a project by project basis on terms to be negotiated.  

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates   

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates
inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets
and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant
sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016.  

All
results are presented in Canadian dollars ($) unless otherwise stated.  

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the Company s financial statements and related notes
thereto, as included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position
and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements, as well as information relating to
the plans of our current management.  

Results
of Operations and Going Concern   

We
are an early stage company with a limited operating history, and we have only recently begun to commercialize our products. As
a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. If our revenues grow slower than
anticipated, or if operating expenses exceed expectations, then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future
or at all, which may depress our stock price. These conditions create an uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.  

We continue to rely on advances and sale of equity to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change
in this situation in the immediate future. There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to access advances and sell
equity, without which we will not be able to continue operations. As a result of advances from members of management and their
families, the Company has adequate capital resources to fund its operations through to the end of December 2016 on the assumptions
under additional financing can be achieved. The Company intends to commence a raise via private placement or direct offering to
the public of equity in our Company in order to fund operations going forward. 

The
execution of the business plan has been delayed until the appropriate commitments have been made for funding. In order to move
forward the Company has entered into an agency agreement with Midtown Partners LLC (a registered broker/dealer based in New York)
as of May 19, 2016 with the objective being to raise up to US$10 Million. The Company is projecting that US$2 to US$3 Million
is required to implement the first phase of the business plan. The initial funding is expected to be comprised of a combination
of debt and equity.  

The
financing will provide working capital for the Company to execute its long term plan as well as facilitating the initial development
of the branded products strategy. The launch of the branded product strategy will involve the implementation of an awareness program
for the Company s brand as well as the establishment of an online ecommerce distribution model.  

If
the funding from the private placement or direct offering is not available in a timely manner then management will continue foregoing
salaries and operations will be scaled back to operate within the funds available. In the normal course of business, management
considers various alternatives to ensure that the Company can meet some of its operating cash flow requirements through financing
activities, such as private placements of common shares, preferred share offerings and offerings of debt and convertible debt
instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities. Management may also consider strategic alternatives, including
strategic investments and divestitures. As future operations may be financed out of funds generated from financing activities,
the ability to do so is dependent on, among other factors, the overall state of capital markets and investor appetite for investments
in the green technology industry and the Company s securities in particular. Should the Company elect to satisfy its cash
commitments through the issuance of securities, by way of either private placement or public offering or otherwise, there can
be no assurance that the efforts to obtain such additional funding will be successful, or achieved on terms favorable to the Company
or its existing shareholders. If adequate funds are not available on favorable terms, the Company may have to reduce substantially
or eliminate expenditures or obtain funds through other sources such as divestiture or monetization of certain assets or sublicensing
(where permitted) of certain rights to certain of the Company s technologies or products.

Results
of Operations and Going Concern    

We are an early stage company with a limited
operating history, and we have only recently begun to commercialize our products. We have incurred operating losses since our
inception in October 2008, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2016,
we had an accumulated deficit of $4,380,135. For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss attributable
to common stockholders of $489,418, and $199,743, respectively.

Operating
Expenses   

The operating expenses increased in the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 $489,418 compared to the same period of 2015 $206,958. This substantial increase
was a result of professional fees increasing by $272,584. The professional fees increased as the Company initiated an investor
relations program.

Net
Loss   

The
Company recognized a net loss of $489,418 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss
of $199,743 for the same period of 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Net
cash used by operating activities was $123,084 and $74,838 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

On May 4, 2016, the Company agreed to a
term loan of $40,000 for bridge financing with a relative of one of the officers of the Company. The loan initially was scheduled
to mature on August 28, 2016 but an agreement has been made to extend the loan to November 28, 2016 under the same terms
as originally negotiated. The terms specify a 30% premium to be paid at the time of maturity. The 30% premium is recognized as
an accretion expense and is amortized on the condensed interim statements of operations. During the 3 month periods ended September
30, 2016 the Company accreted $3,060 (2015 - $nil). In the event the Company is unable to make the payment at maturity, the Company
intends to discuss with the lender an extension of the maturity date. While it is believed that the Company will be able to reach
an accommodation on the loan extension, there can be no assurances to this effect. 

Furthermore,
given the cash shortages the Company has delayed paying trade creditors and professionals pending receipt of expected funds from
financing activities.  

On
October 7, 2016 the Company filed an amended S-1 with the SEC that withdrew the registration of the shares reserved for the EPA,
accordingly the Company may not draw any shares under the EPA. See also Note 6 of the financial statements.  

A
significant portion of the professional fees and stock based compensation are non-cash expenditures resulting in a cash requirement
of approximately $20,000 per month.  

We
do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. However, should we execute our business plan as anticipated, we
would incur substantial capital expenditures and require financing in addition to the amount required to fund our present operation.  

Additional
Financing  

We
continue to rely on advances and sale of equity to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change in this situation in
the immediate future. There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to access advances and sell equity, without
which we will not be able to continue operations. As a result of advances from members of management and their families, the Company
has adequate capital resources to fund its operations through to the end of December. The Company intends to commence a raise
via private placement or direct offering to the public of equity in our Company as early as feasible in order to fund operations
going forward.  

The
execution of the business plan has been delayed until the appropriate commitments have been made for funding. In order to move
forward the Company entered into an agency agreement with Midtown Partners LLC (a registered broker/dealer based in New York)
as of May 19, 2016 with the objective being to raise up to US$10 Million. The Company is projecting that US$2 to US$3 Million
is required to implement the first phase of the business plan. The initial funding is expected to be comprised of a combination
of debt and equity.  

The Company entered into a six month agreement commencing June 24, 2016 with a consulting firm for the provision
of investors relations services. It is anticipated that the contract will not be completed by December 24, 2016; therefore, the
Company intends to enter into discussion with the consulting firm to extend the ending date for the agreement. Management believes
the investor relation services will be provided by the beyond the termination date specified in the contract.  

The
financing will provide working capital for the Company to execute its long term plan as well as facilitating the initial development
of the branded products strategy. The launch of the branded product strategy will involve the implementation of an awareness program
for the Company s brand as well as the establishment of an online ecommerce distribution model.  

If
the funding from the private placement or direct offering is not available in a timely manner then management will continue foregoing
salaries and operations will be scaled back to operate within the funds available. In the normal course of business, management
considers various alternatives to ensure that the Company can meet some of its operating cash flow requirements through financing
activities, such as private placements of common shares, preferred share offerings and offerings of debt and convertible debt
instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities. Management may also consider strategic alternatives, including
strategic investments and divestitures. As future operations may be financed out of funds generated from financing activities,
the ability to do so is dependent on, among other factors, the overall state of capital markets and investor appetite for investments
in the green technology industry and the Company s securities in particular. Should the Company elect to satisfy its cash
commitments through the issuance of securities, by way of either private placement or public offering or otherwise, there can
be no assurance that the efforts to obtain such additional funding will be successful, or achieved on terms favorable to the Company
or its existing shareholders. If adequate funds are not available on favorable terms, the Company may have to reduce substantially
or eliminate expenditures or obtain funds through other sources such as divestiture or monetization of certain assets or sublicensing

to common stockholders of $830,855, and $312,440, respectively. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues
to achieve and maintain profitability. If our revenues grow slower than anticipated, or if operating expenses exceed expectations,
then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress our stock price. These conditions
create an uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
continue to rely on advances and sale of equity to fund operating shortfalls and do not foresee a change in this situation in
the immediate future. There can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to access advances and sell equity, without
which we will not be able to continue operations. We are pursuing additional sources of financing but there is no assurance that
additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all.

We

Operating
Expenses    

The operating expenses increased in the
six month period ended September 30, 2016 ($830,855) compared to the same period of 2015 ($319,665). The most significant
increase in the expenses is attributable to professional fees which increased by $414,353 and there was an increase in
the stock based compensation by $89,528. The professional fees increased as an investor relations firm was engaged to increase
the public profile of the company. The stock based compensation relates to the awarding of stock options as detailed in the notes
to the financial statements. The application and membership fees increased as the Company moved to the OTCQB trading market as
of January 1, 2016 with the annual membership fee being amortized on a monthly basis.

The
Company recognized a net loss of $830,855 for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of
$312,440 for the same period of 2015. Changes in net loss are primarily attributable to changes in expenses, each of which is

and Capital Resources.    

Net
cash used by operating activities was $123,084 and $74,838 for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The decrease is mainly attributable to the delay in the implementation of the business plan.  

The
Company had a working capital deficiency of $677,356 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $765,356 as of March 31, 2016.  

The
current level of development activity necessitates a cash requirement of approximately $20,000 per month. This monthly cash requirement
will increase as the demonstration production facility is developed.  

The
Company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. However, should the Company execute its business plan
as anticipated, it would incur substantial capital expenditures and require financing in addition to the amount required to fund
its present operation.

On November 18, 2016 the Company issued
a convertible promissory note in the amount of $56,000 to GHS Investments, LLC which will be due on August 18, 2017 as described
in Part II, Items 2 and 5 of this Quarterly Report.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

The
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ( US GAAP ) applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods.  

We
have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial statements. A
complete discussion of our accounting policies is included in Note 3 of the annual audited financial statements for the year ended
March 31, 2016.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.  

Going
Concern   

These
financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the development stage and has not yet realized profitable
operations and has relied on non-operational sources to fund operations. The Company has suffered recurring losses and additional
future losses are anticipated as the Company has not yet been able to generate revenue. In addition, as of September 30, 2016,
the Company has a working capital deficiency of $677,356 (March 31, 2016 - $765,356) and an accumulated deficit of $4,380,135
(March 31, 2016 - $3,723,368). The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on successfully executing
its business plan, which includes the raising of additional funds. The Company will continue to seek additional forms of debt
or equity financing, but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so. These circumstances raise substantial
doubt as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due and accordingly, the appropriateness of the use
of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued in May 2016, in August 2015, March 2016 and April
2016, respectively, Accounting Standards Updates No. 2014-09, No. 2015-14, No. 2016-08, and No. 2016-10 (the  ASUs ).
These ASUs were issued in connection with revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard provides a five-step approach
to be applied to all contracts with customers and also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. In August 2015,
the FASB deferred the effective date of the guidance to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December
15, 2017, and will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing, method
of adoption and the expected impact that the standard could have on our financial statements and related disclosures. We expect
to complete our analysis by December 31, 2016. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial
liabilities. The new guidance will impact the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option,
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. All equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other
than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (changes in fair value reported in other
comprehensive income (loss)) for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. In addition, the FASB clarified the need
for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. In general,
the new guidance will require modified retrospective application to all outstanding instruments, with a cumulative effect adjustment
recorded to opening retained earnings. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the
expected impact that the standard could have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  Under
the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases)
at the lease commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease,
measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or
control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain
targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers . The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily
because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance
sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application
is permitted. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must
apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition
accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective
transition approach. We are currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on our financial statements and
related disclosures. 

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 related to stock-based compensation. The new guidance simplifies
the accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim
periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance and the
impact it will have on the financial statements and related disclosures. 

In May 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which is intended to not
change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606, but rather affect only the narrow aspects of Topic 606 by reducing the
potential for diversity in practice at initial application and by reducing the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 both
at transition and on an ongoing basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the financial
statements and related disclosures.

As

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures.   

We conducted an evaluation, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed
or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level
due to the material weaknesses identified and described below. 

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.
Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of
the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual
a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.  

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.  

Management identified the following three
material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level: 

1. We do not have written documentation
of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a
requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the period ending September 30, 2016. Management evaluated the
impact of our failure to have written documentation of all our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure
controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2.
We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size
and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to
the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our
disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.  

3.
Effective controls over the control environment have not been fully implemented. Specifically management has not developed and
effectively communicated to employees its accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further,
our Board of Directors has only one independent member. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization,
management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.  

The
Company has initiated a program to address the above weaknesses, specifically the Company has implemented a Code of Business Ethics
and Conduct policy, an Equal Opportunity policy, a Freedom from Harassment policy, a Substance Abuse policy and a Whistleblower
policy. While segregation of duties is very difficult in a small company the Company has an internal policy that all bank expenditures
are authorized by two people. In addition, the Company has constituted an Audit Committee, consisting of two non-management directors
with the Independent Director as the Chair.  

To
address the material weaknesses identified, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial
statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all
material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

To
remediate the material weakness in our documentation, evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a third-party
firm to assist us in remedying this material weakness. We intend to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation
of duties by hiring additional employees as funding becomes available to implement the business plan in order to segregate duties
in a manner that establishes effective internal controls. All such required remedies are dependent on having the financial resources
available to complete them.  

Changes
in internal controls.   

No change in our system of internal control
over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Shares
to be issued   

On
April 18, 2016, the Company signed an agreement with a consultant pursuant to which it has committed to issue 250,000 common shares
of the Company as compensation for services to be rendered over a period of 5 months. Two directors and officers of the Company
transferred 250,000 of their personal shares to the consultant and as such the Company has agreed to reimburse the directors and
officers for these common shares transferred by issuance of common shares from treasury. The commitment was valued at $86,380
based upon an estimated fair market value of USD$0.27 ($0.35) per share at the date of issue. The retainer has been amortized
over the six months ended September 30, 2016 and was recorded as professional fees on the condensed interim statements of operations.  

On May 19, 2016, the Company signed a letter
of engagement with a consultant which included as part of the fee the issuance of 100,000 common shares as a non-refundable retainer
at a value of $101,579 based upon an estimated fair market value of USD$0.78 ($1.02) per share at the time of the agreement. The
retainer has been recorded as a prepaid expense on the condensed interim balance sheet as at September 30, 2016. 

On July 6, 2016, the Company committed
to issue 20,000 common to a consultant in settlement of a debt at a value of $19,500 (USD$15,000) based upon an estimated fair

PROMISSORY
NOTE    

Algae
Dynamics, Inc.  (hereinafter called the  Company ), hereby promises to pay to the order of  GHS Investments,
LLC , a Nevada Limited Liability Company, or its registered assigns (the  Holder ) the sum of $56,000 upon the
earlier of (i) the Company successfully raising two hundred thousand dollars ( $200,000) or more or (ii) August 18, 2017, (the
 Maturity Date ), together with any interest as set forth herein, and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance
hereof at the rate of ten percent (10%) (the  Interest Rate ) per annum from the date hereof (the  Issue Date )
until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. This Note is being
issued with a ten percent (10%) issuance discount and with one thousand and five hundred dollars ($1,500) being reserved by the
Holder to offset diligence, transaction and legal costs.  

This
Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein. Following any Event of Default, all
amounts owing pursuant to this Note shall bear interest at the rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum from the due date thereof
until the same is paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock) shall be made in lawful money
of the United States of America.  

All
payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Company by written notice made in accordance
with the provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is
not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest
payment date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business
day  shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York
are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.  Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise
defined, shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the supporting documents of same date (attached hereto).  

This
Note is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Company and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof.  

The
following terms shall apply to this Note:  

ARTICLE
I. CONVERSION RIGHTS  

1.1  Conversion
Right . The Holder shall have the right and at any time following ninety days (90) from execution or an Event of Default
(defined below) to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and
non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion
price (the  Conversion Price ) determined as provided herein (a  Conversion );  provided ,  however ,
that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon
conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates
(other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of
the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Company subject to a limitation on
conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would
result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G
thereunder. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by
dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in
the notice of conversion (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Company by the Holder in accordance with
the Sections below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting
in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Company before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion
date (the  Conversion Date ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term  4.99%  above shall be replaced
with  9.99%  following any Event of Default if the Holder, in its sole discretion and in writing, elects to
demand the replacement. If the term  4.99%  is replaced with  9.99%  pursuant to the
preceding sentence, such increase to  9.99%  shall remain at 9.99% until decreased by the Holder in
writing.  

The
number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion
Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion,
(the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Company by the Holder in accordance with the Sections below.  

The term
 Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this
Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Company s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3) at the Company s
option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2)  plus  (4)
at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder.  

1.2  Conversion
Price .  

(a)   Calculation
of Conversion Price . Within ninety (90) days from execution or following any Event of Default, Holder, at its
discretion, shall have the right to convert this Note in its entirety or in part(s) into common stock of the Company valued
at a thirty eight percent (38%) discount off of the lowest intra-day trading price for the Company s common stock
during the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding a conversion date, as reported by Quotestream Media.  

1.3
 Authorized Shares . The Company covenants that during the period the conversion right exists the Company will reserve from
its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for the issuance
of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Company is required at all times to have authorized and reserved five
times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Notes
in effect from time to time)(the  Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance
with the Company s obligations.  

The Company represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Company shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which
would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price,
the Company shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding Notes.  

The
Company (i) acknowledges  that it will irrevocably instruct its transfer agent  to issue certificates for the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers
and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares
of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.  

If,
at any time the Company does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default as defined in this Note.  

1.4  Method
of Conversion .  

(a) 
Mechanics of Conversion . This Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time following an Event
of Default, by (A) submitting to the Company a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means
of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time).  

(b)  Surrender
of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless
the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing
the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory
to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event
of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Holder shall,  prima facie,  be controlling and determinative in the
absence of manifest error. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of
the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount
of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.  

(c)  Payment
of Taxes . The Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other
than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or
other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street
name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the
Company the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been
paid.  

(d)  Delivery
of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Company from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or
other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in
this Section, the Company shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder
certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt (the
 Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of
this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

Within
Five (5) business days of having received common stock pursuant to a Notice of Conversion and prior to having traded any shares
from that specific conversion, Holder may elect to rescind the Notice of Conversion and return the shares, at Holder s expense,
to the Company s Transfer Agent. In the event of such rescission, the principal amount outstanding under this Note shall
be adjusted to include the Conversion Amount which was deducted from the Note as part of the rescinded Notice of Conversion.  

(e)  Obligation
of Company to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to
be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Company defaults on its
obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith
terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such
conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Company s obligation to issue
and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action
by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment
against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the
Company to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Company, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit
such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice
of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Company before 6:00 p.m.,
New York, New York time, on such date.  

(f)  Delivery
of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, provided the Company is participating in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast
Automated Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions
contained in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to
electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s
Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system.  

(g)  Failure
to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other
remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline the Company shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for
each day beyond the Deadline that the Company fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by
the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to
the Company by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal
amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such
additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Company
agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to
frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties
acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section are justified. Any delay or failure of
performance by the Company hereunder shall be excused if and to the extent caused by Force Majeure. For purposes of this
agreement, Force Majeure shall mean a cause or event that is not reasonably foreseeable and not caused by the Company,
including acts of God, fires, floods, explosions, riots wars, hurricanes, etc.  

1.5  Concerning
the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i)
such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Company or its transfer agent
shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for
opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or
transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144
under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an
 affiliate  (as defined in Rule 144) of the Company who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in
accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor. Except as otherwise provided herein (and subject to the
removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have
been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of
securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold
pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend
substantially in the following form, as appropriate:  

NEITHER
THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO
WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I)
IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR
(B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY
THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II)
UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN
CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE
SECURITIES.    

The
legend set forth above shall be removed and the Company shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer
legend if (i) the Company or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary
for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made
without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected or
(ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to this note.  

1.6  Effect
of Certain Events .  

(a)
 Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company, the effectuation by the Company of a transaction or series of related transactions in which
more than 50% of the voting power of the Company is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of
the Company with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Company is not the survivor shall either: (i)
be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Company shall be required to pay to the
Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article
III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual, corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

(b)  Adjustment
Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of
all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or
other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into the same or a different
number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Company or another entity, or in case of any sale
or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Company, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this
Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately
theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive
in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any
limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the
rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation,
provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon
the conversion hereof. The Company shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first
gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior written notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior
written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the
consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or
sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or
acquiring entity (if not the Company) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above
provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(c)
 Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Company shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire
its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any
dividend or distribution to the Company s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock
of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion
of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such
assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had
such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to
such Distribution.  

(d)  Adjustment
Due to Dilutive Issuance . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in
accordance with this Section 1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock in connection with a
financing transaction based on a variable price formula (the  Alternative Variable Price Formula ) that is more
favorable to the investor in such financing transaction than the formula for calculating the Conversion Price in effect on
the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive Issuance ), then
immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the formula for the Conversion Price will be adjusted to match the Alternative
Variable Price Formula. If it is unclear whether the Alternative Variable Price Formula is better or worse, then Holder, in
its sole discretion, may elect at the time of such issuance whether to switch to the Alternative Variable Price Formula or
not.  

(e)  Purchase
Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Company issues any convertible securities or
rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights ) pro rata to the record
holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to
such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number
of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion
contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the
grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

(f)  Notice
of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events
described in this Section 1.6, the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment and
prepare and furnish to the Holder of a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the
facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of the
Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the Conversion
Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or
property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

1.7  Security  As
Security for the Company s obligations contained herein and in all Notes issued by the Company to the Holder,
following any Event of Default, the Holder shall be granted an unconditional first priority interest in and to, any and all

vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that the
remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or

    likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and

I,
Ross Eastley, certify that:  

1.  
      I have reviewed
    this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Algae Dynamics Corp.;   

2.  
      Based on my knowledge,
    this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

3.  
      Based on my knowledge,
    the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
    the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
    report;   

4.  
      The registrant s
    other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
    Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

(a)
      
      Designed such disclosure
    controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
    that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
    within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)   
      Designed such internal
    control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

(c)   
      Evaluated the effectiveness
    of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
    of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

(d)   
      Disclosed in this
    report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5.  
      The registrant s
    other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
    , to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing
    the equivalent functions):   

(a)
      
      All significant
    deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
    likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

(b)   
      Any fraud, whether
    or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal
    control over financial reporting.
