1.  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 
  Business Description. 
    
  Transgenomic, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our , the  Company  or  Transgenomic ) is a biotechnology company advancing personalized medicine for the detection and treatment of cancer and inherited diseases through our proprietary molecular technologies and clinical and research services. A key goal is to bring our Multiplexed ICE COLD-PCR ( MX-ICP ) product to the clinical market through strategic partnerships and licensing agreements, enabling the use of blood and other bodily fluids for more effective and patient-friendly diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer. 
    
  MX-ICP is technology proprietary to Transgenomic. It is a reagent that improves the ability to detect genetic mutations. This technology has been validated internally on all currently available sequencing platforms, including Sanger, Next Gen Sequencing and Digital PCR. By enhancing the level of detection of genetic mutations and suppressing the normal or wild-type DNA, several benefits are provided. 
    
  Historically, our operations were organized and reviewed by management along our major product lines and presented in   two   business segments: Laboratory Services and Genetic Assays and Platforms. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, our operations are now organized as   one   business segment, our Laboratory Services segment, and during the second half of 2015, we began presenting our Genetic Assays and Platforms segment and a portion of our Laboratory Services segment in discontinued operations. 
    
  Our current Laboratory Services business consists of our laboratory in Omaha, Nebraska, which is focused on providing genetic analytical services related to Oncology and pharmacogenomics research services supporting Phase II and Phase III clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our laboratory employs a variety of genomic testing service technologies, including our proprietary MX-ICP technology. Our laboratory in Omaha is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) as a high complexity laboratory and is accredited by the College of American Pathologists. 
    
  Our condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods presented reflect our former Genetic Assays and Platforms activities and Patient Testing business as discontinued operations (See Note 3 -  Discontinued Operations ). 
    
  Going Concern. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) applicable for a going concern, which assume that we will realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have incurred substantial operating losses and have used cash in our operating activities for the past few years. As of September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of   $17.4 million  . Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon a combination of generating additional revenue, improving cash collections, potentially selling underutilized assets and, if necessary, raising additional financing to meet our obligations and pay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could limit our ability to continue our operations. 

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with GAAP. All amounts are presented in U.S. Dollars ( $ ). Supplemental cash flows from discontinued operations are presented in Note 3 -  Discontinued Operations . We have evaluated events occurring subsequent to September 30, 2016 for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and concluded there were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure.

  TRANSGENOMIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from our audited balance sheet as of that date. There has been no change in the balance sheet from December 31, 2015. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results for the interim periods. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on April 14, 2016. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for fiscal year 2016. 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in our condensed consolidated financial statements, which consists of the effects of reclassifications from the presentation of our discontinued operations. 
  Principles of Consolidation. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Transgenomic, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Risks and Uncertainties. 
  Certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in our day-to-day operations and in the process of preparing our financial statements.  The more significant of those risks are presented below and throughout the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Use of Estimates. 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the determination of the fair value of certain assets and related impairments require considerable judgment by management. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Fair Value. 
  Unless otherwise specified, book value approximates fair market value. The common stock warrant liability is recorded at fair value. See Note 9 -  Fair Value  for additional information. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Other Current Assets. 
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash and investments with original maturities at the date of acquisition of three months or less. Other current assets as of September 30, 2016 of   $0.3 million   include prepaid assets of   $0.1 million   and other receivables of   $0.2 million  . 
  Concentrations of Cash. 
  From time to time, we may maintain a cash position with financial institutions in amounts that exceed federally insured limits.  We have not experienced any losses on such accounts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Accounts Receivable. 
  The following is a summary of activity for the allowance for doubtful accounts from continuing operations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  TRANSGENOMIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

While payment terms are generally   30 days  , we have also provided extended payment terms in certain cases. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount and shown net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The estimate made for doubtful accounts is based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a quarterly basis. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual payor receivables and considering a payor s financial condition, credit history, reimbursement rates and current economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and after all collection efforts have been exhausted. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as a reduction in bad debt expense when received. 
  Inventories. 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net of allowance for obsolete inventory. Cost is computed using standard costs for finished goods and average or latest actual cost for raw materials and work in process, which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.  At September 30, 2016, our net inventories were less than   $0.1 million   and were comprised predominantly of raw materials.  
    
  The following is a summary of activity for the allowance for obsolete inventory during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

We determine the allowance for obsolescence by evaluating inventory quarterly for items deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. 
  Property and Equipment. 
  Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows: 
    
                 Leasehold improvements 
    1 to 10 years 
      Furniture and fixtures 
    3 to 7 years 
      Production equipment 
    3 to 7 years 
      Computer equipment 
    3 to 7 years 
      Research and development equipment 
    2 to 7 years 

Depreciation expense in continuing operations related to property and equipment was less than   $0.1 million   for each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Depreciation expense was   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Depreciation expense during each period includes depreciation related to equipment acquired under capital leases.  
  Intangible Assets. 
  Intangible assets include intellectual property and patents.

1. Intellectual Property.    Initial costs paid to license intellectual property from independent third parties are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the license period. Ongoing royalties related to such licenses are expensed as incurred. 
  2. Patents.    We capitalize legal costs, filing fees and other expenses associated with obtaining patents on new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight-line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life beginning on the date the patent is issued. 
  Stock-Based Compensation. 
  All stock-based awards to date have exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant and have   10  -year contractual terms. Unvested awards as of   September 30, 2016   had vesting periods of up to   three   years from the date of grant. None of the awards outstanding at   September 30, 2016   are subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions. 
  We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is based on the calculated fair value of the awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed over the service period of the awards. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded compensation expense for all stock awards of   zero   and   $0.1 million  , respectively, within selling, general and administrative expense.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded compensation expense for all stock awards of   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards was   $0.1 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.1 years  . 
  We granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of   11,250   and   25,250   shares of our common stock during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The fair value of the stock options granted during the year was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rates of   1.56%   based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant; dividend yields of   zero   percent; expected lives of   6.00   years, based on expected exercise activity behavior; and volatility of   85%   based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a time that is consistent with the expected life of the options.  
  Included in our stock awards outstanding as of September 30, 2016 were stock appreciation rights ( SARs )     to purchase   98,333   shares of our common stock. The SARs were issued solely to our executive officers and will vest over   three   years from the date of grant.  
  Net Sales Recognition. 
  Revenue is realized and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 
             
    Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 
                
    Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
                
    The seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 
                
    Collectability is reasonably assured. 
       
   In our Biomarker Identification laboratory, we perform services on a project by project basis. When we receive payment in advance, we initially defer the revenue and recognize it when we deliver the service. These projects typically do not extend beyond one year.  At each of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , deferred net sales associated with pharmacogenomics research projects included in the balance sheet in deferred revenue was   $0.2 million  . 
    
  Net sales from Patient Testing laboratories, reported as part of discontinued operations, are recognized on an individual test basis and take place when the test report is completed, reviewed and sent to the client less the reserve for insurance, Medicare and Medicaid contractual adjustments. There are no deferred net sales associated with our Patient Testing services.  Adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts from third party payers, are reflected in the estimated contractual allowance applied prospectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we adjusted our contractual allowance rates to better reflect the reimbursement level we expect to achieve on Patient Testing billings. The adjustment negatively impacted our Patient Testing revenues for all periods after the third quarter of 2015. (See Note 3 -  Discontinued Operations ). 
    
  Net sales of Genetic Assays and Platforms products, reported as discontinued operations (See Note 3 -  Discontinued Operations ) are recognized in accordance with the terms of the sales arrangement. Such recognition is based on receipt of an

unconditional customer order and transfer of title and risk of ownership to the customer, typically upon shipment of the product under a purchase order. Our sales terms do not provide for the right of return unless the product is damaged or defective. Net sales from certain services associated with the analytical instruments, to be performed subsequent to shipment of the products, is deferred and recognized when the services are provided. Such services, mainly limited to installation and training services that are not essential to the functionality of the instruments, typically are performed in a timely manner subsequent to shipment of the instrument. We also enter into various service contracts that cover installed instruments. These contracts cover specific time periods and net sales associated with these contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period. 
  Common Stock Warrants. 
  Certain of our issued and outstanding warrants to purchase common stock do not qualify to be treated as equity and, accordingly, are recorded as a liability ( Common Stock Warrant Liability ). We are required to present these instruments at fair value at each reporting date and any changes in fair values are recorded as an adjustment to earnings. The Common Stock Warrant Liabilities are considered Level Three financial instruments for purposes of fair value measurement. See Note 9 -  Fair Value  for additional information. 
  Loss Per Share. 
  Basic loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted loss per share includes shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or conversion rights that have exercise or conversion prices below the market value of our common stock. Options, warrants and conversion rights pertaining to   10,701,453   and   10,392,728   shares of our common stock have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive due to the net loss.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer. ASU No. 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of this new accounting guidance by one year.  As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for us for all annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption would be permitted as of the original effective date. The new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and we have not selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)( ASU No. 2014-15 )  .   This guidance addresses management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard amends the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and amends disclosure requirements associated with leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt this guidance and are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  On September 8, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) with Edge BioSystems, Inc. ( Edge Bio ), pursuant to which we sold our manufacturing, marketing and selling of high quality polymer and silica based beads and resin and chromatography columns business (collectively, the  Columns Business ). The Columns Business was part of our former segment, Genetic Assays and Platforms. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Edge Bio acquired substantially all of the assets used solely in connection with the Columns Business and assumed certain liabilities of the Columns Business for a total cash purchase price of approximately   $2.1 million   (the  Asset Sale ), which was paid on September 8, 2015 upon the closing of the Asset Sale. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a gain on the sale of the Columns Business of   $1.5 million  .  
    
  On November 25, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with ADSTEC Corporation ( ADSTEC ) and ADS Biotec Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADSTEC ( Buyer ), pursuant to which we sold (1) to ADSTEC our facilities located in Glasgow, Scotland and on Irvington Road in Omaha, Nebraska (together, the  Facilities ) and all of our stock, inventory and raw materials located at the Facilities (collectively, the  Inventory ), and (2) to Buyer (a) all of the remaining assets relating to our Genetic Assays and Platforms business segment (the  Business ), other than the Inventory (the  Purchased Assets ), and (b) all of the ordinary shares of Transgenomic Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the  Shares ).  
    
  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, ADSTEC and Buyer acquired the Facilities, the Inventory, the Purchased Assets and the Shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $300,000  , and Buyer assumed our financial and human resources commitments related to the Business (the  Transaction ). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a loss on the Transaction of   $1.7 million  . 
    
  Together, the Asset Sale and the Transaction represent the divestiture of our Genetic Assays and Platforms business, resulting in a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the divested operations of our Genetic Assays and Platforms business meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors took actions to begin the process of divesting our Patient Testing business in New Haven, Connecticut. In March 2016, we announced that we had suspended testing services in our Patient Testing laboratory as we review and evaluate various strategic alternatives for that business. As a result of these actions, as of December 31, 2015, our Patient Testing business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. We anticipate that we will complete the divestiture of the Patient Testing business during 2016. 
  The related assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows for both the Genetic Assays and Platforms business and Patient Testing business are classified as assets held for sale, liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations for all periods presented.

4.  INTANGIBLES AND OTHER ASSETS 
  We review our amortizable long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be needed if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset (group). The amount of the loss would be determined by comparing the fair market value of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset (group). 
  Long-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:    

Estimated Useful Life 
      Patents 
    Life of the patent 
      Intellectual property 
    7 years 

Other assets include U.S. security deposits and deferred tax assets, net of applicable valuation allowances. 
  Amortization expense for intangible assets was   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million   during the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is expected to be   $0.1 million   for each of the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

5.         DEBT 

(1) 
    Revolving Line of Credit.     Amounts advanced under the Revolving Line accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the greater of (a)   6.25%   or (b) the   Wall Street Journal   prime rate plus   3%  . The current interest rate is   6.50%  . Interest is payable on a monthly basis, with the balance payable at the maturity of the Revolving Line. Under the Loan Agreement, we pay the Lenders a commitment fee of   $20,000   on each one-year anniversary of March 13, 2013, the Effective Date, during the term of the Revolving Line.  In addition, a fee of   0.5%   per annum is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Revolving Line.  The Revolving Line matures on November 1, 2017. 
       
           (2) 
    Term Loan.     We received   $4.0 million   under the Term Loan on the Effective Date.  Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, as amended, the maturity date of the Loan Agreement was extended until November 1, 2017 and no principal payments on the Term Loan are due until such date. The current interest rate is   9.1%  .  
       
  We will pay the Lenders an additional final payment of   $120,000   at maturity or prepayment of the Term Loan. In addition, if we repay the Term Loan prior to maturity, we will pay the Lenders a prepayment penalty of   1%   of the total outstanding balance under the Term Loan. 
    
  Additional Terms. 
  The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants.  Under the Term Loan, we agreed not to (i) pledge or otherwise encumber our assets other than to the Lenders, (ii) enter into additional borrowings or guarantees, (iii) repurchase our capital stock, or (iv) enter into certain mergers or acquisitions without the Lenders  consent. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause at the discretion of the Lenders. As of September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Ninth Amendment, due to the fact that we did not make the required monthly interest payments during the third quarter and have not received a waiver for the non-compliance and as such all debt has been classified as current at September 30, 2016. 
    
  To secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line and the Term Loan, we granted the Lenders a security interest in all of our assets. The occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Loan Agreement, would increase the applicable interest rate under the Revolving Line or Term Loan (or both) by   5%   and would permit the Lenders to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral under the Loan Agreement. As of the date these financials were available for release, the Lenders have not exercised the remedies under the Loan Agreement. 
    
  (3)     Convertible Promissory Notes.   The Notes accrue interest at a rate of   6%   per year and mature on December 31, 2016.  
    
  Revolving Line and Term Loan. 
    
  On March 13, 2013 (the  Effective Date ), we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with affiliates of Third Security, LLC (the  Lenders ) for (a) a revolving line of credit (the  Revolving Line ) with borrowing availability of up to   $4.0 million  , subject to reduction based on our eligible accounts receivable, and (b) a term loan (the  Term Loan  and, together with the Revolving Line, the  Loan Agreement ) of   $4.0 million  .  Proceeds were used to pay off a   three   year senior secured promissory note payable to PGxHealth, LLC, which was entered into on December 29, 2010 in conjunction with our acquisition of the FAMILION family of genetic tests, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.

The interest on the debt that was deferred and not paid was capitalized as part of the Term Loan.  The amount of interest that was capitalized from March 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015 was   $0.4 million  .

Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, among other things, (a) the Lenders waived specified events of default under the terms of the Loan Agreement, (b) commencing April 1, 2015, we began making monthly interest payments with respect to the Term Loan to the Lenders, (c) we were not be obligated to make monthly payments of principal under the Term Loan to the Lenders until April 1, 2016, (d) we made an initial prepayment of a portion of the Term Loan balance in the amount of approximately   $148,000   on April 1, 2015 and will make one or more additional prepayments to the Lenders under the Loan Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the Loan Agreement, and (e) we were not required to comply with the minimum liquidity ratio under the terms of the Loan Agreement until the earliest to occur of a specified event, as defined in the Loan Agreement, or March 31, 2016. The Sixth Amendment also extends the time period in which we must provide certain reports and statements to the Lenders and amends the circumstances pursuant to which we may engage in certain sales or transfers of our business or property without the consent of the Lenders.  
  As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Loan Agreement, but were not in compliance with the restrictions limiting the amount that we may borrow under the Revolving Line. Accordingly, on August 10, 2015, we received a waiver from the Lenders relating to this non-compliance and paid the Lenders an aggregate of   $0.7 million  , which brought us back into compliance with the terms of the Revolving Line.

engage in certain sales or transfers of our business or property without the consent of the Lenders, and (f) capitalized certain amounts owed by us to the Lenders and added such overdue amounts to the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Line.  
    
  As a result of the Ninth Amendment, the overadvance that existed at March 31, 2016 was added to the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Line and no overadvance existed as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Convertible Promissory Notes. 
    
  On December 31, 2014, we entered into an Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) with an accredited investor (the  Investor ), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Investor in a private placement an unsecured convertible promissory note (the  Initial Note ). We issued the Initial Note in the aggregate principal amount of   $750,000   to the Investor on December 31, 2014. Pursuant to the terms of the Initial Note, interest accrued at a rate of   6%   per year and the Initial Note was set to mature on December 31, 2016. Under the Initial Note, the outstanding principal and unpaid interest accrued was convertible into shares of our common stock as follows: (i) commencing upon the date of issuance of the Initial Note (but no earlier than January 1, 2015), the Investor was entitled to convert, on a one-time basis, up to   50%   of the outstanding principal and unpaid interest accrued under the Initial Note, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) the average closing price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which our common stock is then traded (the  Market ) for the   20   consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion, and (b)   $2.20   (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, other distributions, recapitalizations and the like); and (ii) commencing February 15, 2015, the Investor was entitled to convert, on a one-time basis, any or all of the remaining outstanding principal and unpaid interest accrued under the Initial Note, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to   85%   of the average closing price of our common stock on the Market for the   15   consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion.  The Initial Note has been converted in full into   502,786   shares of our common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Initial Note.  
    
  On January 15, 2015, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with   seven   accredited investors (the  Additional Investors ) and, on January 20, 2015, issued and sold to the Additional Investors, in a private placement, notes (the  Additional Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of   $925,000  .  The Additional Notes have the same terms and conditions as the Initial Note.  As of September 30, 2016,   $400,000   of the aggregate principal amount of the Additional Notes, and accrued interest thereon, has been converted into an aggregate of   281,023   shares of our common stock. 

6.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business. In our opinion, the disposition of pending claims, in excess of recorded accruals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On February 25, 2016, the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska ( UNMC ) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, for breach of contract and seeking recovery of   $0.7 million   owed by us to UNMC. We and UNMC are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A   $0.7 million   liability has been recorded at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 
   In addition, on April 13, 2016, Fox Chase Cancer Center ( Fox Chase ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania Civil Trial Division (the  Court of Common Pleas ), alleging, among other things, breach of contract, tortious interference with present and prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy and seeking punitive damages in addition to damages and other relief. This lawsuit relates to a license agreement we entered into with Fox Chase in August 2000, as amended (the  License Agreement ), as well as the assignment of certain of our rights under the License Agreement to Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. ( IDT ) pursuant to the Surveyor Kit Patent, Technology and Inventory Purchase Agreement we entered into with IDT effective as of July 1, 2014 (the  IDT Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the IDT Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IDT with respect to certain of the claims asserted in the Fox Chase proceeding. On July 8, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas sustained our preliminary objections to several of Fox Chase s claims and dismissed the claims for tortious interference, fraudulent conversion, conspiracy, punitive damages and attorney s fees.  Accordingly, the case has been narrowed so that only certain contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim remain pending against us. We believe that we have good and substantial defenses to the claims asserted by Fox Chase. We are unable to determine whether any loss will occur or to estimate the range of such potential loss; therefore, no amount of loss has been accrued by us as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail.

On June 23, 2016, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ( Mount Sinai ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and, alternatively, unjust enrichment and quantum merit, and seeking recovery of   $0.7 million   owed by us to Mount Sinai for services rendered. We and Mount Sinai are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A   $0.7 million   liability has been recorded at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 
  The outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty.  Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, our financial statements for such reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our services or products to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. 
  We lease certain equipment, vehicles and operating facilities under non-cancellable operating leases that expire on various dates through 2022. The future minimum lease payments required under these leases are   $0.2 million   for the remainder of   2016  ,   $0.7 million   in   2017  ,   $0.7 million   in   2018  ,   $0.7 million   in   2019  ,   $0.7 million   in   2020   and   $0.4 million     thereafter  .  Rent expense for each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.2 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , firm commitments to vendors totaled   $0.1 million  .  

7.  INCOME TAXES 
    
  Annually, we file U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax returns.  All U.S. Federal and most state loss carryforwards remain subject to adjustment in the event of an income tax examination. 
  Income tax expense from continuing operations was   zero   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Income tax expense was   zero   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had an income tax benefit of approximately   one thousand   dollars.  We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, having concluded that we are not more likely than not going to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss carryforwards. 
  During each of the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no material changes to the liability for uncertain tax positions. 

8.  STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Common Stock. 
    
  Pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, we currently have   150,000,000   shares of common stock authorized for issuance. 
  On February 2, 2012, we entered into definitive agreements with institutional and other accredited investors and raised approximately   $22.0 million   in a private placement financing (the  Private Placement ), which included an aggregate of   $3.0 million   in convertible notes issued in December 2011 to entities affiliated with Third Security, LLC, a related party, that automatically converted into shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase such common stock on the same terms as all investors in the Private Placement.  Pursuant to the purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of   1,583,333   shares of our common stock at a price per share of   $12.00  , as well as   five  -year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   823,333   shares of our common stock with an exercise price of   $15.00   per share. In connection with the conversion of the convertible notes issued by us to the entities affiliated with Third Security, LLC, the entities received an aggregate of   250,000   shares of our common stock and   125,000   warrants on the same terms as all investors in the Private Placement. Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC ( Craig-Hallum ) served as the sole placement agent for the offering. In consideration for services rendered as the placement agent in the offering, we agreed to (a) pay to the placement agent cash commissions equal to   $1,330,000  , or   7.0%   of the gross proceeds received in the offering; (b) issue to the placement agent a   five  -year warrant to purchase up to   31,666   shares of our common stock (representing   2%   of the shares sold in the Private Placement) with an exercise price of   $15.00   per share and other terms that are the same as the terms of the warrants issued in the Private Placement; and (c) reimburse the placement agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees paid to the placement agent s legal counsel, incurred in connection with the offering, which reimbursable expenses were not to exceed   $125,000  .  The costs incurred to complete the Private Placement were recorded as a reduction in equity in the amount of   $1.5 million  .  Net proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate and working capital purposes, primarily to accelerate development of several of our key initiatives.

On January 24, 2013, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional and other accredited investors pursuant to which we: (a) sold to the investors an aggregate of   1,383,333   shares of our common stock at a price per share of   $6.00   for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately   $8.3 million  ; and (b) issued to the investors warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   691,655   shares of our common stock with an exercise price of   $9.00   per share (the  2013 Offering ).  The warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time from January 30, 2013 until January 30, 2018 and contain both cash and  cashless exercise  features.  Affiliates of Third Security, LLC purchased an aggregate of   500,000   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of   250,000   shares of common stock in the 2013 Offering on the same terms as the other investors.  Net proceeds from the 2013 Offering were used for general corporate and working capital purposes. 
  In connection with the 2013 Offering, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors (the  Registration Rights Agreement ). The Registration Rights Agreement required that we file with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the shares of common stock sold and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants (the  Warrant Shares ) by March 16, 2013. The registration statement was filed with the SEC on March 15, 2013 and was declared effective by the SEC on March 29, 2013. 
  The 2013 Offering required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of the warrants decreased from   $15.00   per share to   $12.96   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   948,333   to   1,097,600  . 
  On October 22, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors (the  October 2014 Investors ), pursuant to which we, in a private placement, issued and sold to the October 2014 Investors (the  2014 Private Placement ) an aggregate of   730,776   shares of our common stock at a price per share of   $3.25   for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $2.4 million  , and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   365,388   shares of our common stock with an initial exercise price of   $4.00   per share that are exercisable for the period from April 22, 2015 through April 22, 2020. In connection with the 2014 Private Placement, we also issued a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of   9,230   shares of our common stock to one advisor. The warrants issued in the 2014 Private Placement include both cash and  cashless exercise  features.

Pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we are subject to certain registration obligations and we may be required to effect one or more other registrations to register for resale the shares of our common stock issued or issuable under the Initial Note in connection with certain  piggy-back  registration rights granted to the Investor. 
    
  The Note Private Placement required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the February 2012 common stock and warrant sale.  The exercise price of the 2012 warrants decreased from   $10.86   per share to   $10.25   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   1,309,785   to   1,387,685  . 
    
  On January 15, 2015, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement with the Additional Investors and, on January 20, 2015, issued and sold to the Additional Investors, in a private placement, the Additional Notes in an aggregate principal amount of   $925,000   (the  Additional Note Private Placement ).  The Additional Notes have the same terms and conditions as the Initial Note. 
    
  Craig-Hallum acted as the sole placement agent for the sale and issuance of the Additional Notes. In connection with the sale and issuance of the Additional Notes, we issued to Craig-Hallum an unsecured convertible promissory note, upon the same terms and conditions as the Notes, in an aggregate principal amount equal to   5%   of the proceeds received by us pursuant to the sale and issuance of the Additional Notes, or   $46,250   (the  Placement Agent Note ). As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q, the Placement Agent Note remains outstanding. 
    
  The Additional Note Private Placement required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of these warrants decreased from   $10.25   per share to   $9.59   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   1,387,685   to   1,483,161  .

On February 27, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with Craig-Hallum (the  Underwriter ) relating to our sale and issuance of   3,573,899   shares of our common stock and corresponding warrants to purchase up to   714,780   shares of our common stock (the  February 2015 Offering ). Each share of common stock was sold in combination with a warrant to purchase   0.20   of a share of common stock. The purchase price to the public for each share of common stock and accompanying warrant was   $1.95  . 
  The purchase price paid by the Underwriter to us for the common stock and accompanying warrants was   $1.8135  . The net proceeds from the February 2015 Offering, after deducting the Underwriter s discount and other estimated February 2015 Offering expenses, were approximately   $6.2 million  . 
  The accompanying warrants are exercisable immediately upon their initial issuance date at an exercise price of   $2.24   per share and will expire   five   years from the date of issuance. The exercise price will also be subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting our common stock. 
  The February 2015 Offering required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of these warrants decreased from   $9.59   per share to   $7.56   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   1,483,161   to   1,881,396  . 
  On June 30, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors (the  July 2015 Investors ) pursuant to which, on July 7, 2015, we sold to the July 2015 Investors (a) an aggregate of approximately   1.5 million   shares of our common stock at a price per share of   $1.42  , (b) warrants (the  Series B Warrants ) to purchase up to an aggregate of   0.7 million   shares of our common stock with an exercise price of   $0.01   per share, and (c) warrants (the  Series A Warrants  and, together with the Series B Warrants, the  July 2015 Warrants ) to purchase up to an aggregate of   1.2 million   shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of   $1.66   per share (collectively, the  July 2015 Offering ). Each of the July 2015 Warrants has a term of   5 and 1/2 years  . The Series B Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance. The Series A Warrants became exercisable on January 7, 2016,   six months   from the date of issuance. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the July 2015 Offering were approximately   $3.0 million  . 
  Craig-Hallum (the  2015 Placement Agent ) served as the sole placement agent for the July 2015 Offering. In consideration for services rendered as the placement agent in the July 2015 Offering, we (a) paid to the 2015 Placement Agent cash commissions equal to approximately   $212,783  , or   7.0%   of the gross proceeds received in the July 2015 Offering; (b) issued to the 2015 Placement Agent a   five  -year warrant to purchase up to   107,033   shares of our common stock with an exercise price of   $1.66   per share and which is subject to other terms that are the same as the terms of the Series A Warrants; and (c) reimbursed the 2015 Placement Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees paid to the 2015 Placement Agent s legal counsel, incurred in connection with the July 2015 Offering, which reimbursable expenses did not exceed   $50,000  . 
  The July 2015 Offering required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of these warrants decreased from   $7.56   per share to   $6.50   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   1,881,396   to   2,188,177  . 
  On January 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with certain accredited investors (the  2016 Investors ), pursuant to which, on January 8, 2016, we sold to the 2016 Investors, and the 2016 Investors purchased from us (the  January 2016 Offering ), an aggregate of approximately   $2.2 million   of units (the  Units ) consisting of (a) an aggregate of   2,365,243   shares (the  A-1 Preferred Shares ) of our Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the  A-1 Preferred ), and (b) warrants (the  2016 Warrants ) to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,773,929   shares of our common stock. Each Unit was sold to the 2016 Investors at a purchase price of   $0.93   per Unit. The A-1 Preferred Shares are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial rate of 1-for-1, which conversion rate is subject to further adjustment as set forth in our Certificate of Designation of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 8, 2016 (the  Series A-1 Certificate of Designation ). Pursuant to the terms of the Series A-1 Certificate of Designation, the holders of the A-1 Preferred Shares will generally be entitled to that number of votes as is equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the number of whole shares of our common stock into which the A-1 Preferred may be converted as of the record date of such vote or consent, by (ii) 0.93, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, every   1.075269   shares of A-1 Preferred will generally initially be entitled to one vote. In May 2016,   2,150,538   of the A-1 Preferred Shares were converted into   2,150,538   shares of our common stock. At June 30, 2016, there were   214,705   A-1 Preferred Shares outstanding. 
    
  The 2016 Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance, have a term of   five   years and have an exercise price of   $1.21   per share of our common stock. Each 2016 Warrant includes both cash and  cashless exercise  features and an exchange feature whereby the holder of the 2016 Warrant may exchange (the  Exchange Right ) all or any portion of the 2016 Warrant for a number of shares of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the  Exchange Amount  by the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the 2016 Warrant is exchanged (the  Exchange Price ).

  TRANSGENOMIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Under the 2016 Warrants, the  Exchange Amount  is based upon a Black Scholes option pricing model, and the aggregate Exchange Amount under all of the 2016 Warrants will be   $1,436,882  , subject to adjustment to the extent that the risk-free U.S. Treasury rate fluctuates between the date of issuance of the 2016 Warrants and the date the 2016 Warrants are exchanged. Each 2016 Warrant provides that the number of shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Exchange Right is limited to the number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Warrant, unless we have previously obtained stockholder approval or approval from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to issue any additional shares of our common stock (the  Additional Shares ) pursuant to the Exchange Right (the  Required Approvals ). For any Exchange Right exercised more than   90   days following the issuance of the 2016 Warrants, if we have not obtained either of the Required Approvals, we will be required to pay the 2016 Warrant holder an amount in cash for any Additional Shares that we cannot issue without the Required Approvals based on the Exchange Amount. 
    
  The 2016 Warrants further provide that, to the extent the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the 2016 Warrant is exchanged is less than   $0.50  , the Exchange Price will be deemed to be equal to   $0.50  , and, in addition to issuing shares of our common stock based on this Exchange Price, we will be required to pay to the 2016 Warrant holder an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)   $0.50   minus the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the 2016 Warrant is exchanged, by (b) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to the 2016 Warrant holder by the Company in such exchange at an Exchange Price equal to   $0.50  . Therefore, if the Required Approvals are obtained, based on the Exchange Amount of   $1,436,882   (which, as noted above, is subject to adjustment to the extent that the risk-free U.S. Treasury rate fluctuates between the date of the issuance of the 2016 Warrants and the date the 2016 Warrants are exchanged), the maximum number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the Exchange Right in the 2016 Warrants will be   2,873,765  . In addition, if, for example, assuming an Exchange Amount of   $1,436,882  , the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the 2016 Warrants are exchanged is   $0.25  , we would be required to pay to the 2016 Warrant holders cash in an aggregate amount of   $718,441   in addition to issuing the 2016 Warrant holders   2,873,765   shares. 
    
  In accordance with the terms of the SPA, we amended that certain Series A Warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,161,972   shares of our common stock previously issued by us to an affiliate of one of the 2016 Investors on July 7, 2015 (the  Original Warrant ), as previously reported by us on our Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K/A, filed with the SEC on July 7, 2015 (as so amended, the  Amended Warrant ). The Amended Warrant amends the Original Warrant to provide that the Amended Warrant is subject to the same terms and conditions as the 2016 Warrants and, therefore, includes both cash and  cashless exercise  features and an Exchange Right whereby the number of shares issuable pursuant to the Exchange Right is equal to the  Amended Warrant Exchange Amount , which is based on a Black Scholes option pricing model, and will be   $941,197  , subject to adjustment to the extent that the risk-free U.S. treasury rate fluctuates between the date of issuance of the Amended Warrant and the date the Amended Warrant is exchanged. The Amended Warrant is exercisable for up to   1,161,972   shares of our common stock in the event we have obtained either of the Required Approvals with respect to the Amended Warrant. In the event the Amended Warrant holder exercises the Amended Warrant more than   90   days following the issuance of the Amended Warrant, if we have not obtained either of the Required Approvals, we will be required to pay the Amended Warrant holder an amount in cash for the shares of our common stock that we cannot issue under the Amended Warrant pursuant to such exercise without the Required Approvals based on the Amended Warrant Exchange Amount. 
    
  The Amended Warrant also provides that, to the extent the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the Amended Warrant is exchanged is less than   $0.50  , the Exchange Price will be deemed to be equal to   $0.50  , and, in addition to issuing shares of our common stock based on this Exchange Price (assuming receipt of the Required Approvals), we will be required to pay to the Amended Warrant holder an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)   $0.50   minus the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the Amended Warrant is exchanged, by (b) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued to the Amended Warrant holder by us in such exchange at an Exchange Price equal to   $0.50  . Therefore, if the Required Approvals are obtained, based on the Amended Warrant Exchange Amount of   $941,197   (which, as noted above, is subject to adjustment to the extent that the risk-free U.S. Treasury rate fluctuates between the issuance of the Amended Warrant and the date the Amended Warrant is exchanged), the maximum number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the Exchange Right in the Amended Warrant will be   1,882,395  . In addition, if, for example, assuming an Amended Warrant Exchange Amount of   $941,197  , the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the Amended Warrant is exchanged is   $0.25  , we would be required to pay to the Amended Warrant holder cash in an aggregate amount of   $470,599   in addition to issuing the Amended Warrant holder   1,882,395   shares. 
    
  In connection with entering into the SPA, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated January 8, 2016, with the 2016 Investors. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we were required to file with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the A-1 Preferred Shares and the shares

of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the 2016 Warrants and the Amended Warrant by January 25, 2016. We filed the required registration statement with the SEC on January 25, 2016. 
    
  Craig-Hallum (the  Placement Agent ) served as the sole placement agent for the January 2016 Offering. In consideration for services rendered as the Placement Agent in the January 2016 Offering, we (1) paid to the Placement Agent cash commissions equal to approximately   $140,000  , or   7.0%   of the gross proceeds received in the January 2016 Offering, excluding any proceeds received from Third Security, LLC or any of its affiliates; (2) issued to the Placement Agent, for a price of   $50  , a   five  -year warrant to purchase up to   107,527   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $1.21   per share (the  Agent Warrant ), which is subject to the same terms as the 2016 Warrants except that the Agent Warrant was not exercisable until July 8, 2016 and does not contain the Exchange Right; and (3) reimbursed the Placement Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees paid to the Placement Agent s legal counsel, incurred in connection with the January 2016 Offering, which reimbursable expenses did not exceed   $50,000  . 
    
  The January 2016 Offering and the payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in the form of shares of our common stock at a rate of   $1.00   per share of our common stock discussed under  -Conversion of Preferred Stock  below required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of these warrants decreased to   $4.39   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   2,188,177   to   3,239,827  . 
    
  On May 31, 2016, we issued to a vendor an aggregate of   78,000   shares of our common stock and, on June 14, 2016, we issued to a second vendor an aggregate of   64,153   shares of our common stock. Such shares of common stock were issued to the vendors in lieu of an aggregate cash amount of approximately   $89,000   owed by us to such vendors for services previously performed by such vendors. We issued the shares to the vendors in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. The offering of the shares to the vendors did not involve a public offering, and no general solicitation or advertisement was made in connection with the offering of the shares to the vendors. 
    
  On June 7, 2016, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the  ATM Agreement ) with Craig-Hallum, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Craig-Hallum, up to   $3,500,000   of shares (the  Shares ) of our common stock. Any Shares offered and sold in the offering will be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-201907) and the related prospectus previously declared effective by the SEC on February 13, 2015, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated June 7, 2016, that we filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The number of shares eligible for sale under the ATM Agreement will be subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. 
    
  Under the terms of the ATM Agreement, we will pay Craig-Hallum a placement fee of   3.25%   of the gross sales price of the Shares, unless Craig-Hallum acts as principal, in which case we may sell Shares to Craig-Hallum as principal at a price to be agreed upon by us and Craig-Hallum. We will also reimburse Craig-Hallum for certain expenses incurred in connection with the ATM Agreement, and agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to Craig-Hallum with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold   1,035,255   and   1,150,569   shares under the ATM Agreement.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the average sales price per common share was   $0.42   and the aggregate net proceeds from the sales totaled   $0.5 million  .       
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the sale of shares under the ATM Agreement required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of these warrants decreased to   $4.23   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   3,262,088   to   3,362,276  . 
  Common Stock Warrants. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we issued warrants to purchase   3,055,555   and   3,466,841   shares of common stock, respectively.  None of the issued warrants were exercised during such periods.  The warrants issued in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included   1,174,099   warrants issued due to repricing requirements of the Private Placement and   1,881,456   warrants issued in connection with the January 2016 Offering.

(1) 
    These warrants were issued in connection with the Private Placement completed in February 2012 and are classified as a liability in our financial statements.  See Note 9 -  Fair Value  for additional information.  These warrants also contain certain anti-dilution provisions that provide for an adjustment to the exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in the event that we engage in certain issuances of shares of our common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of the warrant. 
               (3)

     Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock. 
    
  On March 5, 2014, we entered into a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Series B Purchase Agreement ) with affiliates of Third Security, LLC (the  2014 Third Security Investors ), pursuant to which we, in a private placement, sold and issued an aggregate of   1,443,297   shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series B Preferred Stock ), at a price per share of   $4.85   for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $7.0 million  .

  In connection with the Series B financing, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated March 5, 2014, with the 2014 Third Security Investors, pursuant to which we granted certain demand,  piggy-back  and S-3 registrations rights covering the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Series B Purchase Agreement and all shares of common stock issuable upon any dividend or other distribution with respect thereto.

The Series B financing required the repricing and issuance of additional common stock warrants to the holders of warrants issued in the Private Placement.  The exercise price of the warrants decreased from   $12.96   per share to   $11.73   per share and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants increased from   1,097,600   to   1,212,665  . 
    
  Conversion of Preferred Stock. 
    
  On January 6, 2016, the Company entered into a Conversion Agreement (the  Conversion Agreement ) with the holders (the  Preferred Holders ) of all of the Company s outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series A Preferred Stock ), and Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to which, among other things, the Preferred Holders: (a) elected to convert all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our  common stock, in each case in accordance with the terms thereof, and (b) agreed that all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock would be paid by the Company in shares of our common stock at a rate of   $1.00   per share of our common stock (collectively, the  Conversion ). 
    
  The outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate of 1-for-3, and the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate of 1-for-1. Prior to the entry into the Conversion Agreement, there were   2,586,205   shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which were converted into   862,057   shares of our common stock, and   1,443,297   shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, which were converted into   1,443,297   shares of our common stock, for an aggregate of   2,305,354   shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (the  Conversion Shares ). At the time of the entry into the Conversion Agreement, there were   $3,681,591.90   in accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which were converted, in accordance with the Conversion Agreement, into   3,681,590   shares of our common stock, and   $793,236.17   in accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which were converted, in accordance with the terms of the Conversion Agreement, into   793,235   shares of our common stock, for an aggregate of   4,474,825   shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Therefore, in connection with the full conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, plus the conversion of all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, we issued an aggregate of   6,780,179   shares of our common stock to the Preferred Holders on January 6, 2016. 
    
  Following the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock into common stock,   no   shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding. 
  Preferred Stock Dividends. 
   We had cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of   zero   and   $4.4 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Since dividends should generally not be recognized as a liability until declared, we had a recorded liability of zero for these undeclared dividends. 
  We had no undeclared dividends for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had undeclared dividends.  In accordance with the FASB s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 260-10-45-11,    Earnings per Share   , these dividends were added to the net loss per share calculation. 

9.  FAIR VALUE 
    
  FASB guidance on fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial assets and liabilities, as well as for other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements. 
  FASB guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or liabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: 
  Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2 Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; and

Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
    
  Debt. 
  Our long term debt book value approximates fair market value due to the variable interest rate it bears.  
    
  Common Stock Warrant Liabilities. 
    
  Certain of our issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock do not qualify to be treated as equity and, accordingly, are recorded as a liability. 
    
  2012 Warrant Liability 
  The 2012 Warrant Liability represents the fair value of the   1.2 million   warrants issued in February 2012, which, through a series of changes in exercise price since February 2012, are now exercisable for   3.4 million   shares of common stock. We are required to record these instruments at fair value at each reporting date and changes are recorded as a non-cash adjustment to earnings. The gains or losses included in earnings are reported in other income (expense) in our Statement of Operations. Management does not believe that this liability will be settled by a use of cash. 
  The 2012 Warrant Liability is considered a Level 3 financial instrument and is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  This method is well suited to valuing options with non-standard features, such as anti-dilution protection.  A Monte Carlo simulation model uses repeated random sampling to simulate significant uncertainty in inputs.  Assumptions and inputs used in the valuation of the common stock warrants are broken down into four sections: Static Business Inputs; Static Technical Inputs; Simulated Business Inputs; and Simulated Technical Inputs. 
  Static Business Inputs include: our equity value, which was estimated using our stock price of   $0.28   as of   September 30, 2016  ; the amount of the down-round financing; the timing of the down-round financing; and the expected exercise period of   0.41   years from the valuation date. 
  Static Technical Inputs include: volatility of   67%   and the risk-free interest rate of   0.42%   based on the   1  -year U.S. Treasury yield interpolated from the six-month and one-year U.S. Treasury bonds.  
  Simulated Business Inputs include: the probability of down-round financing, which was estimated to be   100%   for simulated equity values below the down-round financing cut-off point. 
  Simulated Technical Inputs include: our equity value follows a geometric Brownian motion and is simulated over weekly periods; and a down-round financing event that was randomly simulated in an iteration based on the   100%   discrete probability of a down-round financing for those iterations where our simulated equity value at the expected timing of a down-round financing event was below the down-round financing cut-off point. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the changes in the fair value of the liability measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were comprised of the following:

2016 Warrant Liability 
  The 2016 Warrant Liability represents the fair value of the   1.8 million   warrants issued in January 2016. We are required to record these instruments at fair value at each reporting date and changes are recorded as a non-cash adjustment to earnings. The gains or losses included in earnings are reported in other income (expense) in our Statement of Operations. 
  The Common Stock Warrant Liability is considered a Level 3 financial instrument and is valued using a binomial lattice simulation model.  This method is well suited to valuing options with non-standard features.  Assumptions and inputs used in the valuation of the common stock warrants include; our equity value, which was estimated using our stock price of   $0.28   as of September 30, 2016; volatility of   86%  ; and a risk-free interest rate of   1.04%  . 
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the changes in the fair value of the liability measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were comprised of the following: 

The change in unrealized gains or losses of Level 3 liabilities was included in earnings and was reported in other income (expense) in our Statement of Operations.

  Special Meeting of Stockholders  
  At our 2016 Special Meeting of Stockholders (the  Special Meeting ) held on October 31, 2016, our stockholders approved the proposal to authorize our Board of Directors to, in its discretion, amend our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of between one-for-ten to one-for-thirty, such ratio to be determined by our Board of Directors (the  Reverse Split Proposal ).  The Reverse Split Proposal was described in detail in our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 22, 2016, as supplemented on October 13, 2016.  
  The approval of the Reverse Split Proposal by our stockholders provides our Board of Directors with the authority to carry out the reverse stock split, but our Board of Directors is not obligated to do so. If our Board of Directors determines to effect the reverse stock split, it intends to select a reverse stock split ratio that it believes would be most likely to achieve the anticipated benefits of the reverse stock split. Notwithstanding approval of the Reverse Split Proposal by our stockholders, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, abandon the Reverse Split Proposal and determine, prior to the effectiveness of any filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, not to effect the reverse stock split. If our Board of Directors fails to implement the reverse stock split on or prior to the first anniversary date of the Special Meeting, stockholder approval again would be required prior to implementing any reverse stock split.

Overview 
    
  Transgenomic, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our , the  Company  or  Transgenomic ) is a biotechnology company advancing personalized medicine for the detection and treatment of cancer and inherited diseases through our proprietary molecular technologies and clinical and research services. A key goal is to bring our Multiplexed ICE COLD-PCR ( MX-ICP ) product to the clinical market through strategic partnerships and licensing agreements, enabling the use of blood and other bodily fluids for more effective and patient-friendly diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer. 
    
  MX-ICP is technology proprietary to Transgenomic.  It is a reagent that improves the ability to detect genetic mutations by 100 - 400 fold over existing technologies. This technology has been validated internally on all currently available sequencing platforms, including Sanger, Next Gen Sequencing and Digital PCR.  By enhancing the level of detection of genetic mutations and suppressing the normal, or wild-type, DNA, several benefits are provided.  It is generally understood that most current technologies are unable to consistently identify mutations that occur in less than approximately 5% of a sample.  However, many mutations found at much lower levels, even as low as 0.01%, are known to be clinically relevant and can have significant consequences to a patient: both in terms of how they will respond to a given drug or treatment and how a given tumor is likely to change over time. More importantly, in our view, is the ability to significantly improve the level of detection while using blood, saliva and even urine as a source for DNA, rather than depending on painful, expensive and potentially dangerous tumor biopsies.  We believe that this is an important advancement in patient care with respect to cancer detection, treatment and monitoring and can result in significant cost savings for the healthcare system by replacing invasive procedures with the simple collection of blood or other bodily fluids.  By broadening the types of samples that can be used for testing and allowing all sequencing platforms to provide improved identification of low level mutations, MX-ICP has the potential to make testing more readily available and more patient friendly, enable genetic monitoring of disease progression, effectively guide treatment protocols, and reduce the overall cost of diagnosis and monitoring while significantly improving patient outcomes. 
    
  Historically, our operations were organized and reviewed by management along our major product lines and presented in two business segments: Laboratory Services and Genetic Assays and Platforms. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, our operations are now organized as one business segment, our Laboratory Services segment, and during the fourth quarter of 2015, we began including a portion of our Laboratory Services segment as discontinued operations. 
    
  Our laboratory in Omaha, Nebraska is focused on providing genetic analytical services related to oncology and pharmacogenomics research services supporting Phase II and Phase III clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our laboratory employs a variety of genomic testing service technologies, including our proprietary MX-ICP technology.  ICE COLD-PCR is a proprietary ultra-high sensitivity platform technology with breakthrough potential to enable wide adoption of personalized, precision medicine in cancer and other diseases. It can be run in any laboratory that contains standard PCR systems. MX-ICP enables detection of multiple known and unknown mutations from virtually any sample type, including tissue biopsies, blood, urine, saliva, cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) and circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) at levels greater than 1,000-fold higher than standard DNA sequencing techniques. It is easy to implement and use within existing workflows. Our laboratory in Omaha is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) as a high complexity laboratory and is accredited by the College of American Pathologists. 
    
  Our condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods presented reflect our former Genetic Assays and Platforms activities and Patient Testing business as discontinued operations (See Note 3 -  Discontinued Operations  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

Third Quarter 2016 Overview and Recent Highlights  
    
  Below is a summary of our most recent business activities: 

Signed Data Sharing Agreement with Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. - In September 2016, we signed a data sharing agreement with Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Roche Holdings ( Ventana ). The agreement allows Ventana to access DNA test results from an existing research agreement between us and the University of Melbourne in Australia. As part of this research agreement, the University of Melbourne is conducting additional clinical validation studies of our MX-ICP technology. 
                
    Added New Distributors in China and India for our ICEme Kits that Enable Liquid Biopsy Cancer Testing on Existing Platforms - In September 2016, we signed agreements with two additional distributors in China and India for our ICEme  Mutation Enrichment Kits for cancer genomic testing. The kits incorporate our MX-ICP technology and are designed to enable virtually any laboratory to conduct high quality DNA mutation detection in cancer patients using plasma, blood or tissue samples and existing sequencing platforms. The new distributors, Joying Bio in China and Biotron Healthcare in India, are important suppliers of advanced life science products in their respective markets. 
      
  Uncertainties 
  We have historically operated at a loss and have not consistently generated sufficient cash from operating activities to cover our operating and other cash expenses. We have been able to historically finance our operating losses through borrowings or from the issuance of additional equity. At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $0.1 million  . Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon a combination of generating additional revenue, improving cash collections, potentially selling underutilized assets and, if necessary, raising additional financing to meet our obligations and pay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Results of Continuing Operations  
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net Sales.   Net sales were as follows: 

Net sales increased by $0.1 million, or   38%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . Sales of our contract laboratory services were flat year over year.  The slight increase in total net sales for the current year period reflects higher grant revenues.  
  Cost of Goods Sold.   Cost of goods sold includes material costs for the products that we sell and other direct costs (primarily personnel costs, rent, supplies and depreciation) associated with the operations of our laboratories.  
  Gross Profit.   Gross profit and gross margins were as follows: 

Gross profit was $27,000, or   6%   of total net sales, during the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to negative $115,000, or   (35)%   of total net sales, during the same quarter of   2015  . The increased gross profit during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 is due to increased revenues. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, marketing, travel costs, professional fees, facility costs and bad debt provisions. Our selling, general and administrative  
  
    32 

costs decreased by   $0.4 million   to $  1.3 million   during the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . This decrease was due to lower professional and lower stock compensation costs in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015.  
  Research and Development Expenses.   Research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs, intellectual property fees, patent costs, outside services, laboratory supplies and facility costs and are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , research and development expenses totaled   $0.4 million   as compared to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Research and development expenses totaled   86%   and   138%   of net sales during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Other Income (Expense).   Other expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes interest expense of   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively.  In addition, we recorded less than $0.1 million of other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and other income of $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the revaluation of common stock warrants, which was due to the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability. The income and expense associated with the change in fair value of the warrants is a non-cash item. 
    
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net Sales.   Net sales were as follows: 

Net sales decreased by $0.3 million, or 21%, during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The decrease reflects fewer sales of our contract laboratory services as a result of fewer customers with active projects in the current year partially offset by increased grant revenues in the current year.   
  Cost of Goods Sold.   Cost of goods sold includes material costs for the products that we sell and other direct costs (primarily personnel costs, rent, supplies and depreciation) associated with the operations of our laboratories.  
  Gross Profit.   Gross profit and gross margins were as follows: 

Gross profit was a negative   $0.3 million  , or   (23)%   of total net sales, during the first nine months of   2016  , compared to   $0.1 million  , or   10%   of total net sales, during the same period of   2015  . The decrease in gross profit in the current year is a result of lower revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The negative gross margin in the current year is due to lower revenues that were insufficient to cover our laboratory s fixed direct costs.   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, marketing, travel costs, professional fees, facility costs and bad debt provisions.  Our selling, general and administrative costs decreased by   $1.0 million   to $  4.4 million   during the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . This decrease was due to lower professional fees and lower stock compensation costs in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  
  Research and Development Expenses.   Research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs, intellectual property fees, outside services, collaboration expenses, laboratory supplies and facility costs and are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , research and development expenses totaled   $1.1 million   as compared to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Research and development expenses totaled   89%   and   90%   of net sales during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Other Income (Expense).   Other expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes interest expense of   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively.  In addition, we recorded $0.4 million of other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and other expense of less than $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the revaluation  
  
    33 

of common stock warrants, which was due to the change in fair value of the common stock warrant liability. The income and expense associated with the change in fair value of the warrants is a non-cash item. 
    
  Discontinued Operations For The Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, we decided to divest our Genetic Assays and Platforms business, resulting in a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the divested Genetic Assays and Platforms operations meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. 
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors took actions to begin the process of divesting our Patient Testing business located in New Haven, Connecticut. In March 2016, we announced that we had suspended testing services in our Patient Testing laboratory as we review and evaluate various strategic alternatives for that business. As a result of these actions, our Patient Testing business meets the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. 
    
  The related assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows for both the Genetic Assays and Platforms business and Patient Testing business are classified as assets held for sale, liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
    
  Net loss from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes approximately $0.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in proceeds received from the sale of assets of our discontinued Patient Testing business.   
    
  Revenues and net loss of the discontinued operations consisted of the following: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our working capital positions at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:    

Conversion Agreement 
    
  On January 6, 2016, we entered into a Conversion Agreement (the  Conversion Agreement ) with the holders (the  Preferred Holders ) of all of our outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred ), and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series B Preferred ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Preferred Holders: (1) elected to convert all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred into shares of our common stock in each case in accordance with the terms thereof, and (2) agreed that all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred would be paid by us in shares of common stock at a rate of $1.00 per share of common stock (collectively, the  Conversion ).

     Table of Contents  

The outstanding shares of Series A Preferred were convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 1-for-3, and the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred were convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 1-for-1. Prior to the entry into the Conversion Agreement, there were 2,586,205 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding, which were converted into 862,057 shares of common stock, and 1,443,297 shares of Series B Preferred outstanding, which were converted into 1,443,297 shares of common stock, for an aggregate of 2,305,354 shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred. At the time of the entry into the Conversion Agreement, there were $3,681,591 in accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, which were converted, in accordance with the Conversion Agreement, into 3,681,590 shares of common stock, and $793,236 in accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred, which were converted, in accordance with the terms of the Conversion Agreement, into 793,235 shares of common stock, for an aggregate of 4,474,825 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred. Therefore, in connection with the full conversion of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, plus the conversion of all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, we issued an aggregate of 6,780,179 shares of common Stock to the Preferred Holders on January 6, 2016. 
    
  January 2016 Private Placement 
    
  On January 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  A-1 Preferred Purchase Agreement ) with certain accredited investors (the  A-1 Preferred Investors ), pursuant to which, on January 8, 2016, we sold to the A-1 Preferred Investors, and the A-1 Preferred Investors purchased from us (the  A-1 Preferred Offering ), an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million of units (the  Units ) consisting of (1) an aggregate of 2,365,243 shares (the  A-1 Preferred Shares ) of our Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the  A-1 Preferred ), and (2) warrants (the  Warrants ) to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,773,929 shares of our common stock. Each Unit was sold to the A-1 Preferred Investors at a purchase price of $0.93 per Unit. The A-1 Preferred Shares are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial rate of 1-for-1, which conversion rate is subject to further adjustment as set forth in our Certificate of Designation of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 8, 2016 (the  Series A-1 Certificate of Designation ). Pursuant to the terms of the Series A-1 Certificate of Designation, the holders of the A-1 Preferred Shares will generally be entitled to that number of votes as is equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (a) the number of whole shares of common stock into which the A-1 Preferred may be converted as of the record date of such vote or consent, by (b) 0.93, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, every 1.075269 shares of A-1 Preferred will generally initially be entitled to one vote. 
    
  The Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance, have a term of five years and have an exercise price of $1.21 per share of common stock. Each Warrant also includes both cash and cashless exercise features and an exchange feature whereby the holder of the Warrant may exchange all or any portion of the Warrant for a number of shares of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the  Exchange Amount  by the closing bid price of our common stock on the second trading day prior to the date the Warrant is exchanged (the  Exchange Right ). Under the Warrants, the  Exchange Amount  is based upon a Black Scholes option pricing model, and the aggregate Exchange Amount under all of the Warrants will be $1,436,882, subject to adjustment to the extent that the risk-free U.S. Treasury rate fluctuates between the date of issuance of the Warrants and the date the Warrants are exchanged. Each Warrant provides that the number of shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Exchange Right is limited to the number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, unless we have previously obtained stockholder approval or approval from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to issue any additional shares of our common stock (the  Additional Shares ) pursuant to the Exchange Right (the  Required Approvals ). For any Exchange Right exercised more than 90 days following the issuance of the Warrants, if we have not obtained either of the Required Approvals, we will be required to pay the Warrant holder an amount in cash for any Additional Shares that we cannot issue without the Required Approvals based on the Exchange Amount. 
    
  At the Market Offering 
    
  On June 7, 2016, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the  ATM Agreement ) with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, as sales agent ( Craig-Hallum ), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Craig-Hallum, up to $3,500,000 of shares (the  Shares ) of our common stock. Any Shares offered and sold in the offering will be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-201907) and the related prospectus previously declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on February 13, 2015, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated June 7, 2016, that we filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act. The number of shares eligible for sale under the ATM Agreement will be subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 1,150,569 shares under the ATM Agreement.  The average sales price per common share was $0.42 and the aggregate net proceeds from the sales totaled $0.5 million.

Please see Note 5 -  Debt  and Note 6 -  Commitments and Contingencies  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our outstanding debt and debt servicing obligations. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash on hand of   $0.1 million  . Our current operating plan projects improved operating results and monetization of underutilized assets. As with any operating plan, there are risks associated with our ability to execute it. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations, or achieve the operating improvements as contemplated by the current operating plan. If we are unable to execute this plan, we will need to find additional sources of cash not contemplated by the current operating plan and/or raise additional capital to sustain continuing operations as currently contemplated. We could raise additional funds through various potential sources such as through the sale of assets or sale of debt or equity securities. However, there can be no assurance that the additional funding sources will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to achieve our operating plan or obtain additional financing, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

Analysis of Cash Flows -   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.4 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to an increase of   $1.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These amounts include cash provided by discontinued operations of $1.4 million and cash used in discontinued operations of $1.1 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Cash Flows From Continuing Operations 
  Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities.   The cash flows used in operating activities of   $4.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included a net loss of   $6.2 million   and a decrease in accrued expenses of $0.7 million. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $2.5 million and a decrease in other current assets of $0.3 million. The cash flows used in operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2015   included the net loss of   $7.2 million  , a decrease in accounts payable of $0.2 million and an increase in other current assets of $0.2 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.2 million and other non-cash adjustments of $0.9 million. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities.   Cash flows used in investing activities for continuing operations were $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.    
  Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities.   Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled   $2.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which included net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million from our Unit issuance, $0.5 million from sales under the ATM Agreement and $0.5 million from borrowing on our debt. These proceeds were partially offset by payments on our debt of approximately $0.6 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included net proceeds of $9.0 million from our common stock offerings and $0.9 million from the issuance of unsecured convertible promissory notes. These were partially offset by payments on our debt and capital lease obligations of $0.9 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  At each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
    
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the normal course of business as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements may involve the use of management judgments and estimates. Certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial statements and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management. Our judgments and estimates are based on experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Further, we evaluate our judgments and estimates from time to time as circumstances change. Actual financial results based on judgments or estimates may vary under

     Table of Contents  

different assumptions or circumstances. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.  There have been no changes to those accounting pronouncements listed except as noted in Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements  in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Impact of Inflation 
  We do not believe that price inflation or deflation had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations during the periods presented. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management performed, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  We have evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and concluded that there have not been any changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings  
     We are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business. In our opinion, the disposition of pending claims, in excess of recorded accruals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On February 25, 2016, the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska ( UNMC ) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, for breach of contract and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to UNMC. We and UNMC are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A $0.7 million liability has been recorded at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  
  In addition, on April 13, 2016, Fox Chase Cancer Center ( Fox Chase ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania Civil Trial Division (the  Court of Common Pleas ), alleging, among other things, breach of contract, tortious interference with present and prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy and seeking punitive damages in addition to damages and other relief. This lawsuit relates to a license agreement we entered into with Fox Chase in August 2000, as amended (the  License Agreement ), as well as the assignment of certain of our rights under the License Agreement to Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. ( IDT ) pursuant to the Surveyor Kit Patent, Technology and Inventory Purchase Agreement we entered into with IDT effective as of July 1, 2014 (the  IDT Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the IDT Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IDT with respect to certain of the claims asserted in the Fox Chase proceeding. On July 8, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas sustained our preliminary objections to several of Fox Chase s claims and dismissed the claims for tortious interference, fraudulent conversion, conspiracy, punitive damages and attorney s fees.  Accordingly, the case has been narrowed so that only certain contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim remain pending against us. We believe that we have good and substantial defenses to the claims asserted by Fox Chase. We are unable to determine whether any loss will occur or to estimate the range of such potential loss; therefore, no amount of loss has been accrued by us as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail.  
  On June 23, 2016, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ( Mount Sinai ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and, alternatively, unjust enrichment and quantum merit, and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to Mount Sinai for services rendered. We and Mount Sinai are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A $0.7 million liability has been recorded at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 
  The outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty.  Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, our financial statements for such reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our services or products to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
  Risk factors marked with an asterisk (*) below include a change from or an update to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal   year ended   December 31, 2015     filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  on April 14, 2016. 
    
  *We have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future. 
  We have experienced annual losses from continuing operations since inception of our operations. Our operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $9.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively. These historical losses have been due principally to the expenses that we have incurred in order to develop and market our products, the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs and merger and acquisition costs. 
  
    38 

     Table of Contents  

*Recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
  We have incurred substantial operating losses and have used cash in our operating activities for the past several years. As of September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of   $17.4 million  .  
  The audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 states that our independent registered public accounting firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December 31, 2015 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next 12 months. If that is the case, and if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
  Our current operating plan is designed to improve operating results, improve collection rates and monetize underutilized assets. There are no guarantees that these efforts will be successful and, if not, we may use more cash than projected and not be able to meet our current obligations. As with any operating plan, there are risks associated with our ability to execute it. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations, or achieve the operating improvements as contemplated by the current operating plan. If we are unable to execute this plan, we will need to find additional sources of cash not contemplated by the current operating plan and/or raise additional capital to sustain continuing operations as currently contemplated. We could seek to raise additional funds through various potential sources such as through the sale of assets or sale of debt or equity securities. However, there can be no assurance that the additional funding sources will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to achieve our operating plan or obtain additional financing, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 
  *We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and we may incur even more debt, and we are in default under our loan agreement with affiliates of Third Security, LLC, which means that the lenders under the loan agreement have the right to cease making additional advances, accelerate repayment of all sums due and take action to collect the amounts owed to them, including foreclosing on their security interest, each of which could adversely affect us. 
  Our revolving line of credit and term loan with affiliates of Third Security, LLC, a related party (the  Lenders ), are governed by a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended (the  Loan and Security Agreement ), which contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 30, 2016, we had borrowings of $7.2 million under the Loan and Security Agreement. Under the term loan, we agreed not to (i) pledge or otherwise encumber our assets other than to the Lenders, (ii) enter into additional borrowings or guarantees, (iii) repurchase our capital stock, or (iv) enter into certain mergers or acquisitions without the Lenders  consent. To secure the repayment of amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit and term loan, we granted the Lenders a security interest in all of our assets. As of September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by the Ninth Amendment, due to the fact that we did not make the required monthly interest payments during the third quarter and have not received a waiver for the non-compliance. We are therefore currently in default under the Loan and Security Agreement. Accordingly, under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lenders currently have the right to cease making additional advances, accelerate repayment of all sums due and take action to collect the amounts owed to them, including foreclosing on their security interest or forcing us into bankruptcy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  We may be required to amend our Loan and Security Agreement, refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or raise equity. Further, based upon our actual performance levels, our covenants relating to income, debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements could limit our ability to incur additional debt, which could hinder our ability to execute on our current business strategy. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations and comply with financial covenants depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance will continue to be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
  *Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry. 
  We continue to have substantial debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in our existing indebtedness and in any other agreements under which we incur indebtedness. Our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our  
  
    39 

     Table of Contents  

business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example, our existing level of indebtedness presents the following risks: 
             
    we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances and other general corporate requirements; 
                
    our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies; 
                
    our level of indebtedness and the covenants within our debt instruments may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and 
                
    our outstanding indebtedness may make it difficult for us to attract additional financing when needed. 
       
  As of September 30, 2016, we were not in compliance with the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended by the Ninth Amendment, due to the fact that we did not make the required monthly interest payments during the third quarter and we are therefore currently in default under the Loan and Security Agreement. Accordingly, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. 
    
  Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future. 
  Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
             
    Revenue generated by sales of our products; 
                
    Expenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products; 
                
    Costs of developing new products or technologies; 
                
    Costs associated with capital expenditures; 
                
    The number and timing of strategic transactions; and 
                
    Working capital requirements related to growing existing business. 
       
  We may need additional capital to finance our growth or to compete, which may cause dilution to existing stockholders or limit our flexibility in conducting our business activities. 
  We may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund expansion, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses, technologies or services. Such additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and to the extent we engage in additional debt financing, if available, we may become subject to additional restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If additional financing is not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue as a going concern, fund our expansion, promote our brands, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures. 
  Governmental payers and health care plans have taken steps to control costs. 
  Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the costs of health care services, including clinical testing services. They may reduce fee schedules or limit/exclude coverage for certain types of tests that we perform. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, impose more stringent cost controls and reduce utilization of testing services will continue. These efforts, including changes in laws or regulations, may have a material adverse impact on our business. 
  Weakness in U.S. or global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses. 
  The economies of the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business have experienced significant weakness, which, in the case of the U.S., has recently resulted in significant unemployment and slower growth in economic activity. A decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products, thus reducing our revenue. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has the potential to adversely impact U.S. businesses that operate overseas.

Sales have been variable. 
  Our laboratory performs project-based work that changes from quarter to quarter. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year due to the fact that ICP is a new product and will enable the liquid biopsy market to evolve rapidly and ensure Precision Medicine is adopted globally. We see the ICP business and revenues growing as our commercial strategy is successful and our partnerships and licensing agreements become profitable. 
  Changes in payer mix could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability. 
  Testing services are billed to physicians, patients, government payers such as Medicare, and insurance companies. Tests may be billed to different payers depending on a particular patient s medical insurance coverage. Government payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services as well as reimbursement for laboratory testing services. Further reductions of reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner s signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. Reimbursement for the laboratory services component of our business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. Reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third party payers may occur as well. Such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. As a result, increases in the percentage of services billed to government payers could have an adverse impact on our net sales. 
  We may experience temporary disruptions and delays in processing biological samples at our facilities. 
  We may experience delays in processing biological samples caused by software and other errors. Any delay in processing samples could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Our laboratories require ongoing CLIA certification. 
  The CLIA extended federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. The CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories must also undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. 
  The sanctions for failure to comply with the CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on us. 
  We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, but no assurances can be given that our laboratories will pass all future certification inspections. 
  Failure to comply with HIPAA could be costly. 
  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and associated regulations protect the privacy and security of certain patient health information and establish standards for electronic health care transactions in the United States. These privacy regulations establish federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information. Our Molecular Labs are subject to HIPAA and its associated regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our Patient Testing business. We could also incur liabilities from third party claims. 
  Our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform. 
  Government attention to the health care industry in the United States is significant and may increase. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in March 2010 could adversely impact our business. While certain portions of the legislation have already gone into effect, the ultimate impact of the legislation on the health care industry is still unknown, and the overall impact on our business is likely to be extensive and could result in significant changes to our business and our customers  businesses.

*We are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business. 
  We are subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of our business. Specifically, on February 25, 2016, the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska ( UNMC ) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska for breach of contract and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to UNMC. We and UNMC are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A $0.7 million liability has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  
  In addition, on April 13, 2016, Fox Chase Cancer Center ( Fox Chase ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania Civil Trial Division (the  Court of Common Pleas ), alleging, among other things, breach of contract, tortious interference with present and prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy and seeking punitive damages in addition to damages and other relief. This lawsuit relates to a license agreement we entered into with Fox Chase in August 2000, as amended (the  License Agreement ), as well as the assignment of certain rights of our rights under the License Agreement to Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. ( IDT ), pursuant to the Surveyor Kit Patent, Technology and Inventory Purchase Agreement we entered into with IDT effective as of July 1, 2014 (the  IDT Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the IDT Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IDT with respect to certain of the claims asserted in the Fox Chase proceeding.  On July 8, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas sustained our preliminary objections to several of Fox Chase s claims and dismissed the claims for tortious interference, fraudulent conversion, conspiracy, punitive damages and attorney s fees.  Accordingly, the case has been narrowed so that only certain contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim remain pending against us. We believe that we have good and substantial defenses to the claims asserted by Fox Chase. However, there is no guarantee that we will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail.  
  On June 23, 2016, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ( Mount Sinai ) filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and, alternatively, unjust enrichment and quantum merit, and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by us to Mount Sinai for services rendered. We and Mount Sinai are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability. A $0.7 million liability has been recorded at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 
  Our ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy. In addition, the disposition of any of the pending claims against us, in excess of recorded accruals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  We may be subject to client lawsuits. 
  Providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other legal claims. Potential suits could involve claims for substantial damages. Litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and our reputation. We maintain liability insurance coverage for certain claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum recovery on individual claims and, therefore, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate. 
  *The sale of our products and business operations in international markets subjects us to additional risks. 
  During the past several years, international sales have represented a significant portion of our total net sales. As a result, a major portion of our net sales are subject to risks associated with international sales and operations. These risks include: 
             
    Payment cycles in foreign markets are typically longer than in the U.S., and capital spending budgets for research agencies can vary over time with foreign governments; 
                
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can make our products more costly in local currencies because our foreign sales are typically paid for in British Pounds or in Euros; 
                
    The potential for changes in U.S. and foreign laws or regulations that result in additional import or export restrictions, higher tariffs or other taxes, more burdensome licensing requirements or similar impediments may limit our ability to sell products and services profitably in these markets; and 
                
    The fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the British Pound can cause our net sales and expenses to increase or decrease, which adds risk to our financial statements.  
       
  In addition, many of the countries in which we have sales, including the U.S. and several of the members of the European Union, have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors.  For example, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the  UK ) held a referendum pursuant to which voters elected to leave the  
  
    42 

     Table of Contents  

European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. As a result of UK voters  election to leave the European Union, the British government is expected to begin negotiating the terms of the UK s future relationship with the European Union. Although the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to the European Union markets, Brexit has created additional uncertainties that may ultimately result in new regulatory costs and challenges for companies and increased restrictions on imports and exports throughout Europe, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our operations in Europe and which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Brexit may also increase the possibility that other countries may decide to leave the European Union in the future. 
    
  Our dependence on our suppliers exposes us to certain risks. 
  We rely on various suppliers for products and materials to produce our products. In the event that they would be unable to deliver these items due to product shortages or business closures, we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner or may need to increase our prices. The current economy poses the additional risk of our suppliers  inability to continue their businesses as usual. 
  Our markets are very competitive. 
  Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may enjoy other competitive advantages. This may allow them to more effectively market their products to our customers or potential customers, to develop products that make our products obsolete or to produce and sell products less expensively than us. As a result of these competitive factors, demand for and pricing of our products and services could be negatively affected. 
  Our patents may not protect us from others using our technology, which could harm our business and competitive     position. 
  Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop similar or alternative products or technology, duplicate any of our products, or, if patents are issued to us, design around the patented products developed by us. Our patents or licenses could be challenged by litigation and, if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to us, our competitors could be free to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain additional patents for our technology, or if we are able to do so, patents may not provide us with adequate protection or be commercially beneficial. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits. 
  We cannot be certain that other measures taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. 
  We rely upon trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual confidentiality provisions to protect some of our confidential and proprietary information that we are not seeking patent protection for various reasons. Such measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If such measures do not protect our rights, third parties could use our technology and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. 
  We are dependent upon licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive. 
  We have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties. If these agreements were to terminate prematurely due to our breach of the terms of these licenses or we otherwise fail to maintain our rights to such technologies, we may lose the right to manufacture or sell a substantial portion of our products. In addition, we may need to obtain licenses to additional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive. If we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies, we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive. 
  The protection of intellectual property in foreign countries is uncertain. 
  A significant percentage of our sales are to customers located outside the U.S. Patent and other intellectual property laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. We may need to bring proceedings to defend our patent rights or to determine the validity of our competitors  foreign patents. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and diversion of our other efforts. Finally, some of the patent protections available to us in the U.S. are not available to us in foreign countries due to the laws of those countries. 
  
    43 

     Table of Contents  

Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. 
  There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications submitted for technologies in, or related to, our area of business. As a result, our use of our technology could infringe patents or proprietary rights of others. This may lead others to assert patent infringement or other intellectual property claims against us. We could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against intellectual property claims by third parties. Additionally, any licenses that we might need as a result of any actual infringement might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
  Our failure to comply with any applicable government laws and regulations or otherwise respond to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals that we use may adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources. We cannot be certain that accidental contamination or injury will not occur. Any such accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, resulting in delays and increased costs. 
  *We may issue a substantial amount of our common stock to holders of options and warrants and this could reduce the     market price for our stock. 
  At September 30, 2016, we had obligations to issue   10,701,453   shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or conversion rights. The issuance of these securities may be dilutive to our current stockholders and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. 
  *Our common stock is thinly traded and a large percentage of our shares are held by a small group of unrelated, institutional owners. 
  At September 30, 2016, we had 24,139,130 shares of common stock outstanding. The sale of a significant number of shares into the public market has the potential to cause significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock. This is particularly the case if the shares being placed into the market exceed the market s ability to absorb the stock. This presents an opportunity for short sellers to contribute to the further decline of our stock price. If there are significant short sales of our stock, the price decline that would result from this activity will cause the share price to decline more so, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the stock to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of our stock in the market. In addition, the large concentration of our shares are held by a small group of stockholders which could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market. 
  We have previously identified material weaknesses and ineffective internal controls could impact our business and financial results. 
  Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. In the course of auditing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to proper timing and recognition of revenue and the elements used in our analysis and evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that the allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonably stated. We remediated these material weaknesses in the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. 
  *As we are currently not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ( Nasdaq ), Nasdaq may delist our shares of common stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common shares.  
    
  On February 23, 2016, we received written notice (the  First Notice ) from Nasdaq indicating that, based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the  Minimum Bid Price Requirement ), as set forth  
  
    44 

     Table of Contents  

in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had a period of 180 calendar days, or until August 22, 2016, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To have regained compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must have met or exceeded $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. 
    
  On April 20, 2016, we received a second written notice (the  Second Notice ) from Nasdaq indicating that, based on the stockholders  equity reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016, we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders  equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders  equity of at least $2,500,000 (the  Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(C), we had a period of 45 calendar days, or until June 6, 2016, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement. Nasdaq indicated that, if our plan was accepted, Nasdaq may have granted an extension of up to 180 calendar days, or until October 17, 2016, to evidence compliance. We initially submitted our plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement to Nasdaq on May 31, 2016 and provided Nasdaq with supplemental information on June 22, 2016 and June 29, 2016.  On June 30, 2016, based on the information we submitted to Nasdaq, Nasdaq granted us the maximum allowable 180 day extension to October 17, 2016 to evidence compliance with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement. 
    
  On August 24, 2016, we received a determination letter (the  Determination Letter ) from the staff of Nasdaq stating that we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.  The Determination Letter also stated that we were not eligible for an additional 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement because we did not meet the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders  equity of at least $2,500,000 (the  Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement ), as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and as discussed below. In addition, the Determination Letter provided that our common stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on September 2, 2016 unless we requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the  Panel ). 
    
  On August 29, 2016, we requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the Determination Letter in accordance with Nasdaq rules and as stated in the Determination Letter, and the hearing (the  Hearing ) was held on October 13, 2016.  At the Hearing, we asked that the Panel continue our listing through December 31, 2016, to allow us to close the Merger, which we expect to result in a combined entity that will meet all initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market; however, we noted that we will need to effectuate a reverse stock split to ensure compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
    
  On November 1, 2016, we received a decision letter (the  Decision Letter ) from the staff of Nasdaq stating that the Panel had granted our request for continued listing on Nasdaq until December 31, 2016, subject to the following conditions.   
  . 
           1. 
    On or before November 15, 2016 we must report to the Panel, in writing, regarding the status of the reverse stock split, the filing of a definitive proxy for the Merger, and any feedback received from the staff of Nasdaq regarding the prospects of the application of the post-merger entity for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
       
           2. 
    On or before December 31, 2016, we must have closed the Merger and gained approval from the staff of Nasdaq for listing of the post-merger company on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
       
  In addition, in order to fully comply with the terms of the Decision Letter, we must be able to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq, and, in the event that we are unable to do so, our securities may be delisted from Nasdaq in the future.   
    
  If we are unable to fully comply with the terms of the Decision Letter and are unable to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq, our securities may be delisted from Nasdaq in the future.  We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and consider our available options to resolve our noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with the other listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market. A suspension or delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our relationships with our business partners and suppliers and customers  and potential customers  decisions to purchase our products and services, and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and operating results. In addition, a suspension or delisting could impair our ability to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings and our ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation. 
    
  Upon a potential delisting from Nasdaq, if our common stock is not then eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board  
  
    45 

     Table of Contents  

established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in the trading of our common stock; decreases in institutional and other investor demand for our common stock, coverage by securities analysts, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume; and fewer broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our common stock. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a further decline in the market price of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on us. 
    
  *Failure to complete the Merger and private placement could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results. 
    
  Although we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to obtain stockholder approval of the proposal to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock in connection with the Merger, there is no assurance that these proposals will be approved. If these proposals are not approved, and as a result the Merger is not completed:  

Our ongoing business may be adversely affected; and  
                
    We may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Precipio a termination fee of up to $256,500.  
       
  *The announcement and pendency of the Merger may cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial conditions or results of operations. 
    
  The announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business. Specifically:  

our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following completion of the Merger, which might adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel and attract new personnel;  
                
    third parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the transaction; and  
                
    our management s attention has been focused on the Merger, which may divert management s attention from our core business and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.  
       
  These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations prior to the completion of the Merger.  
    
  *The Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals that may not be received. 
    
  The Merger Agreement provides that the parties cannot complete the Merger unless they receive various consents and approvals from Nasdaq and other third parties.  While we believe that we will receive the requisite approvals, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be received. 
    
  *While the Merger is pending, we will be subject to contractual limitations that could adversely affect our business. 
    
  The Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions while the Merger is pending without Precipio s consent, including incurring indebtedness, making capital expenditures in excess of $5,000, acquiring any assets or selling, leasing or otherwise transferring any assets, and increasing in any material manner the compensation, bonuses or benefits of any directors, officers, employees, former employees or consultants, subject to certain exceptions in the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise and making other changes to our business prior to the closing of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. 
    
  *The Merger Agreement restricts our ability to pursue certain alternatives to the Merger and requires us to pay a reverse termination fee to Precipio if we do. 
    
  The Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit or encourage or take any action to discuss or accept a competing third-party proposal. Although our Board of Directors is permitted to change its recommendation that stockholders approve the matters relating to the Merger if it determines in good faith that this action is reasonably likely to be required to comply with its fiduciary duties and certain other conditions, doing so in certain situations would require us to pay a termination fee to Precipio of $256,500.  Additionally, these non-solicitation provisions could discourage a potential acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, or might result in a potential acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable to Precipio in certain circumstances.

*We have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger. 
    
  We have incurred and will incur additional substantial expenses in connection with the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed. These costs include fees for financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, filing fees and financial printing costs. If the Merger is not consummated, we will be responsible for our own expenses, which are not reimbursable in the event the Merger does not occur.

Item 2.                Unregistered  Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  On May 31, 2016, we issued to a vendor an aggregate of 78,000 shares of our common stock and, on June 14, 2016, we issued to a second vendor an aggregate of 64,153 shares of our common stock. Such shares of common stock were issued to the vendors in lieu of an aggregate cash amount of approximately $89,000 owed by us to such vendors for services previously performed by such vendors. We issued the shares to the vendors in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. The offering of the shares to the vendors did not involve a public offering, and no general solicitation or advertisement was made in connection with the offering of the shares to the vendors.

  ARTICLE I 
  STOCKHOLDERS 
  Section 1.   Time and Place of Meetings.   All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, or by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors, and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. [Sections 211(a), (b).] 
  Section 2.   Annual Meetings.   An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be designated by the Board of Directors, at which meeting the stockholders shall elect by a plurality vote the directors to succeed those whose terms expire at that meeting and shall transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. 
  Section 3.   Special Meetings.   Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may only be called (i) by the Chairman of the Board, (ii) by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors or (iii) by the Chief Executive Officer, if one is appointed, otherwise the President. [Section 211(d).] 
  Section 4.   Notice of Meetings.   Written notice of every meeting of the stockholders, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. [Section 222.] 
  Section 5.   Quorum and Adjournment.   The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section 4 of Article I hereof, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any adjourned meeting at  

which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. [Sections 216, 222(c).] 
  Section 6.   Voting.   Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the Corporation on the record date for the meeting, and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation. No vote of the stockholders need be taken by written ballot unless otherwise required by law. Any vote which need not be taken by ballot may be conducted in any manner approved by the meeting. Every vote taken by written ballot shall be counted by one or more inspectors of election appointed by the Board of Directors. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock which has voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question properly brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. [Sections 212, 216.] 
  Section 7.   Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors.   Nominations for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting of the stockholders may be made by the Board of Directors, or on behalf of the Board of Directors by a Nominating Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting. Any nominations, other than those made by or on behalf of the Board of Directors, and any proposal by any stockholder to transact any corporate business at an annual or special stockholders meeting, shall be made by notice in writing and mailed by certified mail to the Secretary of the Corporation and (i) in the case of an annual meeting, received no later than 35 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that if less than 35 days  notice of a meeting of stockholders is given to the stockholders, such notice of proposed business or nomination by such stockholder shall have been made or delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of a meeting was mailed, and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders, received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed. A notice of nominations by stockholders shall set forth as to each proposed nominee who is not an incumbent director (i) the name, age, address and principal occupation of each nominee proposed in such notice, (ii) the number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by each such nominee and the nominating stockholder and (iii) any other information concerning the nominee that must be disclosed regarding nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules under such section. 
    
  The Chairman of the Board, or in his absence the Chief Executive Officer, if one is appointed, otherwise the President or the Secretary, may, if the facts warrant, determine and  

declare to the meeting of stockholders that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure and that the defective nomination shall be disregarded. 
  Section 8.   Inspectors of Elections.   Preceding any meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more persons to act as Inspectors of Elections and may designate one or more alternate inspectors. In the event either no inspector or alternate is appointed or no inspector or alternate is able to act, the Secretary shall serve as the inspector or the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of an inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector shall: 
  (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each; 
  (b) determine the shares represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; 
  (c) count all votes and ballots; 
  (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and 
  (e) certify his or her determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and his or her count of all votes and ballots. 
  The inspector may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in the performance of the duties of inspector. 
  When determining the shares represented and the validity of proxies and ballots, the inspector shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation. The inspector may consider reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers or their nominees or a similar person which represent more votes than the holders of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspector considers other reliable information as outlined in this Section, the inspector, at the time of his or her certification pursuant to (e) of this Section, shall specify the precise information considered, the person or persons from whom the information was obtained, when this information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained, and the basis for the inspector s belief that such information is accurate and reliable. [Sections 231(a), (b), (d).] 
  Section 9.   Opening and Closing of Polls.   The date and time for the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter to be voted upon at a meeting of stockholders shall be announced at the meeting. The inspector of the election shall be prohibited from accepting any ballots, proxies or votes nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto after the closing of the polls, unless the Court of Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise. [Section 231(c).] 
    
  Section 10.   Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone.   So long as the Corporation has 35 or fewer stockholders, any stockholder may participate in any meeting of  

stockholders by conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 
  ARTICLE II 
  DIRECTORS 
  Section 1.   General Powers.   The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation. [Sections 141(b), (k).] 
  Section 3.   Vacancies.   Vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum of the Board

At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time to another place, time or date, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. [Section 141(b).] 
  Section 7.   Written Action.   Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes or proceedings of the Board or such committee. [Section 141(f).] 
  Section 8.   Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone.   Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any such committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. [Section 141(i).] 
  Section 9.   Committees.   The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the entire Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation and each to have such lawfully delegable powers and duties as the Board may confer. Each such committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Except as otherwise provided by law, any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Any committee or committees so designated by the Board shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise prescribed  

by the Board of Directors, a majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the members present at a meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of such committee. Each Committee shall act at meetings held pursuant to duly issued notice as set out in Section 5 of this Article, waivers of notice or unanimous written consent. Each committee shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings and its method of procedure, subject to any rules prescribed by the Board of Directors, and shall keep a written record of all actions taken by it. No such committee shall have the power or authority: 
  (a) to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or provide for the issuance of shares of stock or fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of shares or the conversion into, or the exchange of shares for, shares of any class or classes or any other series of the same of the Corporation or fix the number of shares of any series of stock or authorize the increase or decrease of the shares of any series; 
  (b) to adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Section 251 or Section 252 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; 
  (c) to recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation s property and assets;

  (f) to declare a dividend. 
  Section 10.   Compensation.   The Board of Directors may establish such compensation for, and reimbursement of the expenses of, directors for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors or committees, or for other services by directors to the Corporation, as the Board of Directors may reasonably determine. [Section 141(h).] 
  Section 11.   Regulations; Manner of Acting.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may adopt such special rules and regulations for the conduct of their meetings and for the management of the property, affairs and business of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. The directors shall act only as a Board, and the individual directors shall have no power as such. 
  ARTICLE III 
  NOTICES

  ARTICLE V 
  INDEMNIFICATION 
  Section 1.   Right to Indemnification.   Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a  proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter an  indemnitee ), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or employee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys  fees, judgments, fines,  

ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article V with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 1 of this Article V shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an  advancement of expenses  and provided, further, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires it, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article V or otherwise (hereinafter an  undertaking ). 
  Section 2.   Right of Indemnitee To Bring Suit.   If a claim under Section 1 of this Article V is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses), it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Likewise, in any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met such standards. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is  

not entitled to be indemnified or to such advancement of expenses under this Article V or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 
  Section 3.   Nonexclusivity of Rights.   The rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, contract, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 
    
  Section 4.   Insurance.   The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any indemnitee against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
  Section 5.   Indemnification of Agents of the Corporation.   The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article V or as otherwise permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. 
  Section 6.   Indemnification Contracts.   The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article V. 
  Section 7.   Effect of Amendment.   Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article V by the stockholders or the directors of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification. [Section 145.]

Such certificates shall be numbered and their issuance recorded in the books of the Corporation, and such certificates shall exhibit the holder s name and the number of shares and shall be signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chief Executive Officer, if one is appointed, otherwise the President and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation.

As a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the Secretary may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates to give the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Secretary may direct as indemnity against any claims that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed or the issuance of the new certificate. [Section 167.] 
  Section 4.   Record Date.   (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
  (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
