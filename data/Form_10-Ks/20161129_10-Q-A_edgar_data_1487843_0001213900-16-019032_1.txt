1.
ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Yangtze River Development Limited (the  Company 
or  Yangtze River ) and its subsidiaries, Energetic Mind Limited ( Energetic Mind ), Ricofeliz Capital
(HK) Limited ( Ricofeliz Capital ), and Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. ( Wuhan Newport ).  

The
Company, formerly named as Kirin International Holding, Inc., and Ciglarette, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
December 23, 2009. The Company was a development stage company and has not generated significant revenue since inception to March
1, 2011.  

On
March 1, 2011, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement that Kirin China Holding Limited ( Kirin China )
became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary. Kirin China engaged in the development and sales of residential and commercial
real estate properties, and development of land lots in People s Republic of China ( China , or the  PRC ).  

On
December 19, 2015, the Company completed a share exchange (the  Share Exchange ) with Energetic Mind and all the shareholders
of Energetic Mind, whereby Yangtze River acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Energetic Mind, in exchange
for 151,000,000 shares of Yangtze River s common stock, which constituted approximately 88% of its issued and outstanding
shares on a fully-diluted basis of Yangtze River immediately after the consummation of the Share Exchange, and an 8% convertible
note (the  Note ) in the principal amount of $150,000,000. As a result of the Share Exchange, Energetic Mind became
Yangtze River s wholly-owned subsidiary and Jasper Lake Holdings Limited ( Jasper ), the former shareholder
of Energetic Mind, became Yangtze River s controlling stockholder. The Share Exchange transaction with Energetic Mind was
treated as an acquisition, with Energetic Mind as the accounting acquirer and Yangtze River as the acquired party. The financial
statements before the date of the Share Exchange are those of Energetic Mind with the results of the Company being consolidated
from the date of the Share Exchange.  

Energetic
Mind owns 100% of Ricofeliz Capital and operates its business through its subsidiary Wuhan Newport.  

Wuhan
Newport was a wholly owned subsidiary of Wuhan Renhe Group Co., Ltd. (the  Wuhan Renhe ), a company incorporated in
the PRC as at September 23, 2002. On July 13, 2015, Wuhan Renhe transferred all of the equity interests of the Company to Ricofeliz
Capital, a company incorporated in Hong Kong on March 25, 2015. Ricofeliz Capital was incorporated by Energetic Mind, a company
incorporated in British Virgin Islands ( BVI ). Energetic Mind was incorporated by Mr. Liu Xiangyao on January 2,
2015, and was subsequently purchased by various companies incorporated in BVI or the United States of America ( USA ),
among whom Jasper became its 64% owner. Jasper was 100% owned by Mr. Liu Xiangyao, a Hong Kong citizen.  

The
major assets of Wuhan Newport include land lots for developing commercial buildings that are in line with the principal activities
of Kirin China.  

On
December 31, 2015, the Company entered into certain stock purchase and business sale agreements (the  Agreements )
with Kirin Global Enterprises, Inc. (the  Purchaser ), a California corporation and an entity controlled by a former
officer and director of the Company whereby the Company sold its interest in certain subsidiaries (see note 11) for an aggregate
of $75,000,002. (the  Sale ).  

Pursuant
to the terms of the Agreements, Jasper agreed to finance the Sale by reducing Company s financial obligations of the Note
by an aggregate of $75,000,000. In addition, the Purchaser agreed to pay the remaining two dollars in cash.  

Upon
completion of the Sale, the Company operates its business solely through its subsidiary Wuhan Newport, primarily engaging in the
business as a port logistic center located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the PRC.

   NOTES
TO unaudited condensed FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

2.1
Basis of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all the subsidiaries. All transactions and balances
between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheets are presented unclassified because the time required to complete real estate projects and
the Company s working capital considerations usually stretch for more than one-year period.  

2.2
Use of estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews these estimates using the currently available
information. Changes in facts and circumstances may cause the Company to revise its estimates. Significant accounting estimates
reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements include: (i) the allowance for doubtful debts; (ii) accrual of estimated
liabilities; and (iii) contingencies; (iv) deferred tax assets; (v) impairment of long-lived assets; (vi) useful lives of property
plant and equipment; and (vii) real estate property refunds and compensation payables.  

2.3
Cash and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less, which are unrestricted
as to withdrawal and use the Company maintains accounts at banks and has not experienced any losses from such concentrations.  

2.4
Property and equipment   

The
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The depreciation is computed on a straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets with 5% salvage value. Estimated useful lives of property and equipment are stated
in Note 7.  

The
Company eliminates the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired from the accounts and includes
any gain or loss in the statement of income. The Company charges maintenance, repairs and minor renewals directly to expenses
as incurred; major additions and betterment to equipment are capitalized.  

2.5
Impairment of long-lived assets   

The
Company applies the provisions of ASC No. 360 Sub topic 10,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360- 10)
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever
any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value.  

The
Company tests long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets, for impairment at least
annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater
than its fair value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent
of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its
evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows,
the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation
of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows as the rate the Company utilizes to evaluate potential
investments. The Company estimates fair value based on the information available in making whatever estimates, judgments and projections
are considered necessary. There were no impairment losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

2.6
Fair values of financial instruments   

ASC
Topic 825, Financial Instruments ( Topic 825 ) requires disclosure of fair value information of financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques
are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard,
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be
realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial assets
and liabilities from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts do not represent the underlying
value of the Company.  

Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

  Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instruments.  

  Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, financial instruments of the Company primarily comprise of cash, accrued interest receivables,
other receivables, short-term bank loans, deposits payables and accrued expenses, which were carried at cost on the balance sheets,
and carrying amounts approximated their fair values because of their generally short maturities.  

2.7
Convertible notes   

In
accordance with ASC subtopic 470-20, the convertible notes are initially carried at the principal amount of the convertible notes.
Debt premium or discounts, which are the differences between the carrying value and the principal amount of convertible notes
at the issuance date, together with related debts issuance cost, are subsequently amortized using effective interest method as
adjustments to interest expense from the debt issuance date to its first redemption date. Convertible notes are classified as
a current liability if they are or will be callable by the Company or puttable by the debt holders within one year from the balance
sheet date, even though liquidation may not be expected within that period.  

2.8
Foreign currency translation and transactions   

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in the U.S. dollar (US$), which is the Company s
reporting currency. Yangtze River, Energetic Mind, and Ricofeliz Capital uses US$ as its functional currency. Wuhan Newport uses
Renminbi Yuan ( RMB ) as its functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement
amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the statements of operations.  

In
accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translated the assets and liabilities into US$ using the rate of
exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an
average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in owners  equity as part
of accumulated other comprehensive income.

2.9
Revenue recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue from steel trading when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  

Real
estate sales are reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment, Real Estate Sales.  

Revenue
from the sales of completed properties and properties where the construction period is twelve months or less is recognized by
the full accrual method when (a) sale is consummated; (b) the buyer s initial and continuing involvements are adequate to
demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (c) the receivable is not subject to future subordination; (d) the Company has
transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in a transaction that is in substance a sale and does not have
a substantial continuing involvement with the property. A sale is not considered consummated until (a) the parties are bound by
the terms of a contract or agreement, (b) all consideration has been exchanged, (c) any permanent financing for which the seller
is responsible has been arranged, (d) all conditions precedent to closing have been performed. Fair value of buyer s payments
to be received in future periods pursuant to sales contract is classified under accounts receivable. Sales transactions not meeting
all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method,
all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability.  

Revenue
and profit from the sale of development properties where the construction period is more than twelve months is recognized by the
percentage-of-completion method on the sale of individual units when the following conditions are met: (a)construction is beyond
a preliminary stage; (b) the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non-delivery of the
unit; (c) sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property; (d) sales
prices are collectible and (e) aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated. If any of these criteria are not
met, proceeds are accounted for as deposits until the criteria are met and/or the sale consummated.  

The
Company has not generated any revenue from the sales of real estate property for the nine months and three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

2.10
Real estate capitalization and cost allocation   

Real
estate property completed and real estate properties and land lots under development consist of commercial units under construction
and units completed. Properties under development or completed are stated at cost or estimated net realizable value, whichever
is lower. Cost capitalization of development and redevelopment activities begins during the predevelopment period, which we define
as the activities that are necessary to begin the development of the property. We cease capitalization upon substantial completion
of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We also cease capitalization when activities
necessary to prepare the property for its intended use have been suspended. Costs include costs of land use rights, direct development
costs, interest on indebtedness, construction overhead and indirect project costs. The Company acquires land use rights with lease
terms of 40 years through government sale transaction. Land use rights are divided and transferred to customers after the Company
delivers properties. The Company capitalizes payments for obtaining the land use rights, and allocates to specific units within
a project based on units  gross floor area. Costs of land use rights for the purpose of property development are not amortized.
Other costs are allocated to units within a project based on the ratio of the sales value of units to the estimated total sales
value.  

2.11
Capitalization of interest   

In
accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, interest incurred during construction is capitalized to properties under
development. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $nil and $nil were capitalized as properties under development,
respectively.  

2.12
Advertising expenses   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred, or the first time the advertising takes place, in accordance with ASC 720-35, Advertising Costs.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded advertising expenses of $1,459 and $nil, respectively.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the company recorded advertising expenses of $nil and $nil, respectively.  

2.13
Share-based compensation   

The
Company grants restricted shares to its non-employee consultants. Awards granted to non-employees are measured at fair value at
the earlier of the commitment date or the date the services are completed, and are recognized using graded vesting method over
the period the service is provided.

2.14
Income taxes   

Current
income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. As part of the process of preparing
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements at each year-end and tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable for the differences that are expected to affect taxable income.  

The
Company adopts a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position measurement and financial statement
recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution
of related appeals or litigation process, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any uncertain
tax position.  

2.15
Land Appreciation Tax ( LAT )   

In
accordance with the relevant taxation laws in the PRC, the Company is subject to LAT based on progressive rates ranging from 30%
to 60% on the appreciation of land value, which is calculated as the proceeds of sales of properties less deductible expenditures,
including borrowing costs and all property development expenditures. LAT is prepaid at 1% to 2% of the pre-sales proceeds each
year as required by the local tax authorities, and is settled generally after the construction of the real estate project is completed
and majority of the units are sold. The Company provides LAT as expensed when the related revenue is recognized based on estimate
of the full amount of applicable LAT for the real estate projects in accordance with the requirements set forth in the relevant
PRC laws and regulations. LAT would be included in income tax expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss).  

2.16
Earnings (loss) per share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding during
the period for convertible notes under if-convertible method, if dilutive. Potential common shares are not included in the denominator
of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which
a net loss is recorded.  

2.17
Comprehensive loss   

Comprehensive
loss includes net income (loss) and foreign currency adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reported in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as presented on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets are the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.  

2.18
Contingencies   

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out
of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations and tax matters. In accordance
with ASC No. 450 Sub topic 20,  Loss Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such loss contingencies when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

2.19
Recently issued accounting pronouncements   

The
