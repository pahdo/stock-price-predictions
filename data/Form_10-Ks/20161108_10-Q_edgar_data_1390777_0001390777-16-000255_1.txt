(a) 
    See  Supplemental information   Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures  beginning on page   48   for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. 
              (b) 
    Non-GAAP information for all periods presented excludes the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets and M I, litigation and restructuring charges.  Non-GAAP information for the   third quarter of 2016   also excludes a recovery of the previously impaired Sentinel loan. 
              (c) 
    Tangible book value per common share - Non-GAAP and tangible common equity exclude goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities.  See  Supplemental information   Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures  beginning on page   48   for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. 
              (d) 
    Excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business and the Other segment. 
                (g) 
    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.  The leverage capital ratio is based on Tier I capital, as phased-in, and quarterly average total assets.  The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital, as phased-in, and average quarterly assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures.  For additional information on our capital ratios, see  Capital  beginning on page   37  .   
              (h) 
    The estimated fully phased-in CET1 ratios (Non-GAAP) are based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period.  For additional information on these Non-GAAP ratios, see  Capital  beginning on page   37  . 
              (i) 
    The estimated fully phased-in SLR (Non-GAAP) is based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules.  When the SLR becomes effective in 2018 as a required minimum ratio, we expect to maintain an SLR of over 5%.  The minimum required SLR is 3% and there is a 2% buffer, in addition to the minimum, that is applicable to BNY Mellon and other U.S. global systemically important banks ( G-SIBs ).  For additional information on these Non-GAAP ratios, see  Capital  beginning on page   37  .

Part I - Financial Information 

Items 2. and 3. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

General 
    
  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,   references to  our,   we,   us,   BNY Mellon,  the  Company  and similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.    The term  Parent  refers to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation but not its subsidiaries. 
    
  Certain business terms used in this report are defined in the Glossary included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Report ).  
    
  The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.    Investors should also read the section titled  Forward-looking Statements.     
    
  How we reported results 
    
  Throughout this Form 10-Q, certain measures, which are noted as  Non-GAAP financial measures,  exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons using measures that relate to our ability to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within our control.  See  Supplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures  beginning on page   48   for a reconciliation of financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures. 
    
  We also present the net interest revenue and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent ( FTE ) basis.  We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice.  The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.   
    
  When we refer to BNY Mellon s  Basel III  capital measures (e.g., CET1), we mean those capital measures as calculated under the U.S. capital rules. 

Overview 
    
  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ( BNY Mellon ) was the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE symbol: BK).  With a rich history of     maintaining our financial strength and stability through all business cycles, BNY Mellon is a global investments company dedicated to improving lives through investing.    
    
  We manage and service assets for financial institutions, corporations and individual investors in 35 countries and more than 100 markets.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , BNY Mellon had   $30.5 trillion   in assets under custody and/or administration, and   $1.7 trillion     in assets under management.     
    
  BNY Mellon is focused on enhancing our clients  experience by leveraging our scale and expertise to deliver innovative and strategic solutions for our clients, building trusted relationships that drive value.  We hold a unique position in the global financial services industry.  We service both the buy-side and sell-side, providing us with unique marketplace insights that enable us to support our clients  success.    
    
  BNY Mellon s businesses benefit from the global growth in financial assets, the globalization of the investment process, changes in demographics and the continued evolution of the regulatory landscape - each providing us with opportunities to advise and service clients.     

Key   third quarter 2016   and subsequent events 
    
  Resolution plan 
    
  In April 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  FDIC ) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve ) jointly announced that the agencies had determined that the Company s 2015 resolution plan was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the statutory standard established in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ), and issued a joint notice of deficiencies and shortcomings regarding the Company s plan and the actions that  

4   BNY Mellon 

must be taken to address them.  As required, we made an Oct. 1, 2016 submission to the agencies, which provided our plans to address the shortcomings and, we believe, addressed all of the deficiencies identified by the agencies.   
    
  Following the receipt of the agencies  April 2016 feedback, we have changed our preferred resolution strategy in the event of our material financial distress or failure to a single point of entry ( SPOE ) strategy.  We currently believe that this requires us to issue approximately $2 - $4 billion of incremental unsecured long-term debt above our typical funding requirements by July 2017 to satisfy resource needs in a time of distress.  This estimate is subject to change as we further refine our strategy and related assumptions.  The additional debt is currently expected to have a modest negative impact to net interest revenue. 
    
  Preferred stock issuance and increase in cash dividend on common stock    
    
  In conjunction with the Federal Reserve s non-objection to BNY Mellon s 2016 capital plan, in August 2016, we issued $1 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, $750 million of which satisfied the contingency for the repurchase of up to $560 million of common stock in connection with our 2016 plan.  In the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased   $464 million   of common stock.    See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our preferred stock.  See Item 2 in Part II - Other information for additional information related to our common stock repurchase program. 
    
  Also included in the 2016 capital plan was a 12% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.19 per share.  The first payment of the increased quarterly cash dividend was Aug. 12, 2016.    
    
  Settlement agreement with Sentinel s bankruptcy trustee    
    
  On July 13, 2016, a settlement agreement between BNY Mellon and the bankruptcy trustee for Sentinel Management Group, Inc. ( Sentinel ) was accepted by the bankruptcy court.  The settlement resulted in the release of trust assets to BNY Mellon.  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a recovery of $13 million related to Sentinel.    

Highlights of third quarter 2016 results 
    
  We reported net income applicable to common shareholders of   $974 million  , or   $0.90   per diluted common share, or   $979 million  , or   $0.90   per diluted common share, as adjusted (Non-GAAP) in the   third quarter of 2016  .  In the   third quarter of 2015  , net income applicable to common shareholders was   $820 million  , or   $0.74   per diluted common share, or $828 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, as adjusted (Non-GAAP).  In the   second quarter of 2016  , net income applicable to common shareholders was   $825 million  , or   $0.75   per diluted common share, or $830 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share, as adjusted (Non-GAAP)  .    See  Supplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures  beginning on page   48   for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. 
    
  Highlights of the   third quarter of 2016   include: 

AUC/A totaled   $30.5 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $28.5 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  The   7%   increase primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See  Investment Services business  beginning on page   19  .) 
                
    AUM totaled   $1.72 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $1.63 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  The   6%   increase primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).  AUM excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business and the Other segment.  (See  Investment Management business  beginning on page   16  .) 
                
    Investment services fees totaled   $1.89 billion  , an increase of   2%   compared with   $1.85 billion   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, higher fees in Depositary Receipts and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  (See  Investment Services business  beginning on page   19  .) 
                
    Investment management and performance fees totaled   $860 million  , an increase of   4%   compared with   $829 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects higher market values and money market fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar  

BNY Mellon   5    

and net outflows of AUM in prior periods. (See  Investment Management business  beginning on page   16  .) 
             
    Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled   $183 million   compared with   $179 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  Foreign exchange revenue totaled   $175 million  , a decrease of   3%   compared with   $180 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility, partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activity.  (See  Fee and other revenue  beginning on page   7  .) 
                
    Financing-related fees totaled   $58 million   compared with   $71 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and lower fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity.  (See  Fee and other revenue  beginning on page   7  .) 
                
    Investment and other income totaled   $92 million   compared with   $59 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects higher asset-related and seed capital gains.  (See  Fee and other revenue  beginning on page   7  .) 
                
    Net interest revenue totaled   $774 million   compared with   $759 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase primarily reflects   the actions we have taken to reduce the levels of our lower yielding interest-earning assets and higher yielding interest-bearing deposits, as well as the impact of higher market interest rates.    Net interest margin (FTE) was   1.06%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared with   0.98%   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  (See  Net interest revenue  beginning on page   10  .) 
                
    The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $19 million  , driven by net recoveries of $13 million.  The provision for credit losses was   $1 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  (See  Asset quality and allowance for credit losses  beginning on page   29  .) 

Noninterest expense totaled   $2.64 billion   compared with   $2.68 billion   in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower expenses in most expense categories, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower other, furniture and equipment, legal, net occupancy and business development expenses, partially offset by higher staff and distribution and servicing expenses.  (See  Noninterest expense  beginning on page   13  .) 
                 
    The net unrealized pre-tax gain on the total investment securities portfolio was   $1.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $1.6 billion   at   June 30, 2016  .  The decrease primarily reflects an increase in market interest rates.  (See  Investment securities  beginning on page   25  .)

Fee and other revenue 

(b) 
    Excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business and the Other segment.  
      N/M - Not meaningful. 

Fee and other revenue increased   3%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and increased   5%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .    The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment and other income, investment management and performance fees and issuer services fees, partially offset by lower financing-related fees.  The sequential increase primarily reflects higher issuer services fees, investment management and performance fees and investment and other income. 
    
  Investment services fees 
    
  Investment services fees were impacted by the following compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and the   second quarter of 2016  : 

Asset servicing fees increased   1%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and slightly decreased compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .    The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees and securities lending revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable  

impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and downsizing of the UK transfer agency business.  
             
    Clearing services fees increased   1%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and decreased slightly compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .    The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business.  
                
    Issuer services fees increased   8%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and increased   44%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .    The year-over-year increase primarily reflects increased activity in Depositary Receipts and higher money market fees in Corporate Trust.  The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher fees in Depositary Receipts.     
                
    Treasury services fees were unchanged compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and decreased   1%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .

See the  Investment Services business  in  Review of businesses  for additional details. 
    
  Investment management and performance fees  
    
  Investment management and performance fees totaled   $860 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , an increase of   4%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   4%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects higher market values and money market fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net outflows of assets under management in prior periods.  The increase compared with the   second quarter of 2016   primarily reflects higher market values.  Performance fees were   $8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $7 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $9 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  Total AUM for the Investment Management business was   $1.7 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , an increase of   6%   compared with   Sept. 30, 2015   and   3%   compared with   June 30, 2016  .  The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).    Net long-term inflows of   $1 billion   in   the   third quarter of 2016   were a combination of   $3 billion   of inflows into actively managed strategies and   $2 billion   of outflows from index strategies.    Net short-term outflows totaled   $1 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016  . 
    
  See the  Investment Management business  in  Review of businesses  for additional details. 
    
  Foreign exchange and other trading revenue 

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled   $183 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $179 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $182 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  . 

Foreign exchange trading revenue is primarily driven by the volume of client transactions and the spread realized on these transactions, both of which are impacted by market volatility.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , foreign exchange revenue totaled   $175 million  , a decrease of   3%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and an increase of   5%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility, partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activity.  The year-over-year decrease also reflects the   continued trend of clients migrating to lower margin products.  The sequential increase primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipt-related foreign exchange activity, partially offset by lower volatility.      Foreign exchange revenue is reported in the Investment Services business and the Other segment.   
    
  Generally speaking, custody clients enter into foreign exchange transactions in one of three ways: negotiated trading with BNY Mellon, BNY Mellon s standing instruction programs, or transactions with third-party foreign exchange providers.  Negotiated transactions generally refer to transactions entered into by the client or the client s investment manager, with all decisions related to a transaction made by the client or its investment manager.  The preponderance of the notional value of our trading volume with clients is in negotiated trading.  Our standing instruction programs, which are Session Range and our standard Defined Spread program, provide custody clients and their investment managers with an end-to-end solution that allows them to shift to BNY Mellon the cost, management and execution risk, often in small transactions or transactions in restricted and difficult to trade currencies.  A shift by custody clients from our standing instruction programs to other trading options combined with competitive market pressures on the foreign exchange business is negatively impacting our foreign exchange revenue.  For the quarter ended     Sept. 30, 2016  , total revenue for all types of foreign exchange trading transactions was approximately   4%   of our total revenue, and approximately 27% of our foreign exchange revenue was generated by transactions in our standing instruction programs. 
    
  Total other trading revenue was   $8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared with a   $1 million   loss in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $16 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fixed income trading, partially offset by lower equity and other trading.   

8   BNY Mellon 

The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower results from derivative trading and hedging activity.  Other trading revenue is reported in all three business segments. 
    
  Financing-related fees 
    
  Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the Investment Services business and the Other segment, include capital markets fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.  Financing-related fees totaled   $58 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $71 million     in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $57 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and lower fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity. 
    
  Distribution and servicing fees 
    
  Distribution and servicing fee revenue was   $43 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $41 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $43 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. 
    
  Investment and other income 

(a) 
    Does not include the gain (loss) on seed capital investments in consolidated investment management funds which are reflected in operations of consolidated investment management funds, net of noncontrolling interests.  The gain (loss) on seed capital investments in consolidated investment management funds was   $8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $6 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  ,   $(17) million   in the   third quarter of 2015  ,   $15 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   and   $7 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  . 

Investment and other income includes corporate and bank-owned life insurance contracts, expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, lease-related gains, seed capital gains, asset-related gains, equity investment losses and other income.  Expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture.  Asset-related gains include real estate, loan and other asset dispositions.  Other income primarily includes foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), other investments and various miscellaneous revenues.  Investment and other income was   $92 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared with   $59 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $74 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both increases primarily reflect higher asset-related and seed capital gains.   
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Fee and other revenue for the   first nine months of 2016   totaled   $9.12 billion   compared with   $9.13 billion   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower investment management and performance fees and foreign exchange and other trading revenue, partially offset by higher investment and other income, issuer services fees and asset servicing fees.  The decrease in investment management and performance fees primarily reflects outflows in prior periods, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound), the July 2015 sale of Meriten and lower performance fees, partially offset by higher money market fees.  The decrease in foreign exchange and other trading revenue primarily reflects lower volumes and the continued trend of clients migrating to lower margin products.  The increase in investment and other income primarily reflects foreign currency remeasurement gains and higher asset-related and seed capital gains.  The increase in issuer services fees primarily reflects higher money market fees in Corporate Trust.  The increase in asset servicing fees primarily reflects net new business, higher money market fees and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

Net interest revenue    

FTE - fully taxable equivalent. 
  bps - basis points. 

Net interest revenue totaled   $774 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , an   increase   of   $15 million   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and an   increase   of   $7 million   compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .    Both increases primarily reflect the actions we have taken to reduce the levels of our lower yielding interest-earning assets and higher yielding interest-bearing deposits, as well as the impact of higher market interest rates.  The sequential increase also reflects higher average loans.    
    
  The net interest margin (FTE) was   1.06%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared with   0.98%   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   0.98%   in the   second quarter of 2016  .    The year-over-year and sequential increases primarily reflect the factors noted above.  
    
  Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately   20%   of our average total deposits in the   third quarter of 2016  .    Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S dollar deposits were euro-denominated in the   third quarter of 2016  . 

As previously indicated, we evaluated the impact of our resolution plan strategy on net interest revenue.  We currently believe that it requires us to issue approximately $2 - $4 billion of incremental unsecured long-term debt above our typical funding requirements by July 2017 to satisfy resource needs in a time of distress.  This estimate is subject to change as we further refine our strategy and related assumptions.  The additional debt is currently expected to have a modest negative impact to net interest revenue.    
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Net interest revenue totaled   $2.3 billion   in the   first nine months of 2016  , an increase of   $41 million   compared with the   first nine months of 2015  .  The increase in net interest revenue primarily reflects the impact of higher market interest rates, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedging activities and lower securities due to lower deposits.  The net interest margin (FTE) was   1.02%   in the   first nine months of 2016  , compared with   0.98%   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  The increase in the net interest margin (FTE) primarily reflects the factors noted above.

Noninterest expense 

N/M - Not meaningful. 

Total noninterest expense decreased   1%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and increased   1%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects lower expenses in most categories, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower other, furniture and equipment, legal, net occupancy and business development expenses, partially offset by higher staff and distribution and servicing expenses.  The increase compared with the   second quarter of 2016   primarily reflects higher staff expense and M I, litigation and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses in most other expense categories including business development, sub-custodian, net occupancy, other, software and furniture and equipment expenses.    Excluding amortization of intangible assets and M I, litigation and restructuring charges, noninterest expense (Non-GAAP) decreased   1%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and increased slightly compared with the   second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  We   continue to invest in our risk management, regulatory compliance and other control functions in light of increasing regulatory requirements.  As a result, we expect an increase in our expense run rate relating to these functions. 

Staff expense 
    
  Given our mix of fee-based businesses, which are staffed with high-quality professionals, staff expense comprised   56%   of total noninterest expense in the   third quarter of 2016   and   54%     in both the   third quarter of 2015     and     second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  Staff expense increased   2%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   4%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both increases primarily reflect higher incentive and severance expenses and the annual employee merit increase.  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   was partially offset by lower temporary services expense.  
    
  Non-staff expense 
    
  Non-staff expense includes certain expenses that vary with the levels of business activity and levels of expensed business investments, fixed infrastructure costs and expenses associated with corporate activities related to technology, compliance, legal, productivity initiatives and business development. 
    
  Non-staff expense totaled   $1.2 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016  , a decrease of   5%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   3%   (unannualized)  

BNY Mellon   13    

compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects lower expenses in most categories, primarily driven by lower other, furniture and equipment, legal, net occupancy and business development expenses, partially offset by higher distribution and servicing expenses.  The decrease compared with the   second quarter of 2016   primarily reflects lower expenses in most non-staff expense categories including business development, sub-custodian, net occupancy, other, software and furniture and equipment expenses, partially offset by higher M I, litigation and restructuring charges.  Non-staff expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets and M I, litigation and restructuring charges (Non-GAAP), totaled   $1.1 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016  , a decrease of   6%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   4%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .   
    
  We continue to benefit from the business improvement process, including the continued impact from vendor renegotiations, and the execution of additional real estate actions that will allow us to optimize our physical footprint and improve how our employees work.  
    
  For additional information on restructuring charges, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Noninterest expense totaled   $7.9 billion   in the   first nine months of 2016  , a decrease of $215 million, or   3%  , compared with   $8.1 billion   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories.  The lower expenses, primarily incentives, other, temporary services, legal, furniture and equipment, business development and net occupancy, reflect, in part, the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the continued benefit of the business improvement process.  The decrease was primarily offset by higher severance and distribution and servicing expense.  

Income taxes 
    
  BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of   $324 million   (  24.6%   effective tax rate) in the   third quarter of 2016  .  The income tax provision was   $282 million   (  25.4%   effective tax rate) in the   third quarter  

of 2015   and   $290 million   (  24.9%   effective tax rate) in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The effective tax rates primarily benefited from foreign operations, tax-exempt income and tax credits. 
    
  We   expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25-26% in 2016. 

Review of businesses 
    
  We have an internal information system that produces performance data along product and service lines for our two principal businesses and the Other segment. 
    
  Business accounting principles 
    
  Our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting principles used for consolidated financial reporting.  These measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance.    
    
  For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, the primary types of revenue by business and how our businesses are presented and analyzed, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or when improvements are made in the measurement principles.  
    
  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we revised the net interest revenue for our business to reflect adjustments to our transfer pricing methodology to better reflect the value of certain deposits.  Also beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we refined the expense allocation process for indirect expenses to simplify the expenses recorded in the Other segment to include only expenses not directly attributable to the Investment Management and Investment Services operations.  These changes did not impact the consolidated results.    
    
  The results of our businesses may be influenced by client and other activities that vary by quarter.  In the first quarter, incentive expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees.  In the third quarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of client dividend payments paid  

14   BNY Mellon 

in the quarter.  Also in the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client activity.  In the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher business development and marketing expenses.  In our Investment Management business, performance fees are typically higher in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter represents the end of the measurement period for many of the performance fee-eligible relationships.  
    
  The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.  We are  

primarily impacted by activities denominated in the British pound, euro and the Indian rupee.  On a consolidated basis and in our Investment Services business, we typically have more foreign currency denominated expenses than revenues.  However, our Investment Management business typically has more foreign currency denominated revenues than expenses.  Overall, currency fluctuations impact the year-over-year growth rate in the Investment Management business more than the Investment Services business.  However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact net income on a consolidated basis. 

The following table presents key market metrics at period end and on an average basis.

    The JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index is based on the implied volatility in 3-month currency options. 
     bps - basis points. 

Fee   revenue in Investment Management, and to a lesser extent in Investment Services, is impacted by the value of market indices.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , we estimate that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common share by $0.02 to $0.04.    
    
  Fee waivers are highly sensitive to changes in the Fed Funds effective rate.  Assuming no change in client     

behavior, we expect to recover approximately 70% of the pre-tax income related to fee waivers with a 50 basis point increase in the Fed Funds effective rate, inclusive of the 25 basis point increase in December 2015.    
    
  See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the consolidating schedules which show the contribution of our businesses to our overall profitability.

  Review of financial results 
    
  Investment management fees are dependent on the overall level and mix of AUM and the management fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one percent) charged for managing those assets.  Assets under management were   $1.72 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $1.63 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2015  , an increase of   6%  .    The increase primarily reflects higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).    

Net long-term inflows of   $1 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016   were a combination of $3 billion of inflows into actively managed strategies and $2 billion of outflows from index strategies.  Net short-term outflows were   $1 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016  . 
    
  Total revenue was   $958 million  , an increase of   3%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   2%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both increases primarily reflect higher market values and seed capital gains, partially offset by losses on hedging activities and investments.  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   also reflects higher distribution and servicing fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).  
    
  Revenue generated in the Investment Management business included   40%   from non-U.S. sources in the  

BNY Mellon   17    

third quarter of 2016  , compared with   42%   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   40%   in the   second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  Investment management fees in the Investment Management business were   $837 million  , an increase of   4%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   4%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects higher market values and money market fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound) and net outflows of assets under management in prior periods.  The increase compared with the   second quarter of 2016   primarily reflects higher market values. 
    
  Performance fees were   $8 million   compared with   $7 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $9 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  
    
  Distribution and servicing fees were   $49 million   compared with   $37 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $49 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects higher money market fees. 
    
  Other revenue was a loss of   $18 million   compared with a loss of   $5 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and a loss of   $10 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both decreases primarily reflect losses on hedging activity and investments, partially offset by higher seed capital gains.  The decrease compared with the   third quarter of 2015   also reflects payments to Investment Services related to higher money market fees. 
    
  Net interest revenue was   $82 million   compared with   $83 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $82 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects the impact of changes in the internal crediting rates beginning in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by record average loans and higher average deposits.  Average loans increased   20%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   3%   compared with  

the   second quarter of 2016  , while average deposits  
  increased   2%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   1%   compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increases in average loans were driven by our program to extend banking solutions to high net worth clients. 
    
  Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was   $680 million  , an increase of   2%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and a decrease of   1%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the   third quarter of 2015   was primarily driven by higher distribution and servicing expense as a result of lower money market fee waivers and higher incentive and severance expenses, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  The decrease compared with the   second quarter of 2016   primarily reflects lower other expenses, partially offset by higher incentive and severance expenses.  
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Income before taxes totaled   $707 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared with   $758 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  Income before taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) was   $767 million   compared with   $831 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  Fee and other revenue decreased $128 million compared with the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily reflecting net outflows in prior periods, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and losses on hedging activity, partially offset by higher money market fees.  Net interest revenue increased $12 million compared with the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily due to higher average loans and deposits, partially offset by the impact of changes in the internal crediting rates beginning in the first quarter of 2016.  Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, decreased $49 million compared with the   first nine months of 2015  , primarily reflecting lower incentive expense and the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher distribution and servicing expense as a result of lower money market fee waivers.

We help our clients service their financial assets through a network of offices and service delivery centers in 35 countries across six continents. 
    
  The results of this business are driven by a number of factors, which include: the level of transaction activity; the range of services provided, which may include custody, accounting, fund administration, daily valuations, performance measurement and risk analytics, securities lending, and investment manager back-office outsourcing; the number of accounts; and the market value of assets under custody and/or administration.  Market interest rates impact both securities lending revenue and the earnings on client balances.  Business expenses are driven by staff, technology investment, equipment and space required to support the services provided by the business and the cost of execution, clearance and custody of securities.   
    
  We are one of the leading global securities servicing providers with   $30.5 trillion   of AUC/A at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  We are one of the largest custodians for U.S. corporate and public pension plans and we service 50% of the top-50 endowments.  We are a leading  

custodian in the UK, servicing around a fifth of UK pensions that require a custodian, and with approximately 20% of such assets for the sector in our custody.  Globalization tends to drive cross-border investment and capital flows, which increases the opportunity to provide solutions to our clients.  The changing regulatory environment is also driving client demand for new solutions and services. 
    
  BNY Mellon is a leader in both global and U.S. Government securities clearance.    We settle securities transactions in over 100 markets   and handle most of the transactions cleared through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 19 of the 23 primary dealers.    We are a leader in servicing tri-party collateral with approximately $2.2 trillion serviced globally.  We currently service approximately $1.4 trillion, or approximately 86%, of the $1.6 trillion tri-party repo market in the U.S.     
    
  Global Collateral Services serves broker-dealers and institutional investors facing expanding collateral management needs as a result of current and emerging regulatory and market requirements.  Global Collateral Services brings together BNY Mellon s global capabilities in segregating, optimizing, financing and transforming collateral on behalf of clients, including its market leading broker-dealer collateral management, securities lending, collateral financing, liquidity and derivatives services teams.

Role of BNY Mellon, as a trustee, for mortgage-backed securitizations 
    
  BNY Mellon acts as trustee and document custodian for certain mortgage-backed security ( MBS ) securitization trusts.  The role of trustee for MBS securitizations is limited; our primary role as trustee is to calculate and distribute monthly bond payments to bondholders.  As a document custodian, we hold the mortgage, note, and related documents provided to us by the loan originator or seller and provide periodic reporting to these parties.  BNY Mellon, either as document custodian or trustee, does not receive mortgage underwriting files (the files that contain information related to the creditworthiness of the borrower).  As trustee or custodian, we have no responsibility or liability for the quality of the portfolio; we are liable only for performance of our limited duties as described above and in the trust documents.  BNY Mellon is indemnified by the servicers or directly from trust assets under the governing agreements.  BNY Mellon may appear as the named plaintiff in legal actions brought by servicers in foreclosure and other related proceedings because the trustee is the nominee owner of the mortgage loans within the trusts.  
    
  BNY Mellon also has been named as a defendant in legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the trustee has expansive duties under the governing agreements, including to investigate and pursue claims against other parties to the MBS transaction.    For additional information on our legal proceedings related to this matter, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Review of financial results 
    
  AUC/A totaled   $30.5 trillion  , an increase from   $28.5 trillion   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .    The increase was primarily driven by higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.    AUC/A consisted of 34% equity securities and 66% fixed income securities at both   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Sept. 30, 2015  . 
    
  Investment services fees were   $1.9 billion  , an increase of   2%   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   5%   (unannualized) compared with the   second quarter of 2016   reflecting the following factors: 

Asset servicing fees (global custody, broker-dealer services and Global Collateral Services) were   $1.039 billion   compared with   $1.034 billion   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $1.043 billion   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects higher money market fees and securities lending revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and downsizing of the UK transfer agency business.  
                
    Clearing services fees were   $347 million   compared with   $345 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $350 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the third quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business. 
                
    Issuer services fees (Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts) were   $336 million   compared with   $312 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $233 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects increased activity in Depositary Receipts and higher money market fees in Corporate Trust.  The increase compared with the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects seasonally higher fees in Depositary Receipts.   
        
  Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled   $177 million   compared with   $179 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $161 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility.  The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2015 also reflects the   continued trend of clients migrating to lower margin products.  The increase     compared with the second quarter of 2016     primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipt-related foreign exchange activity, partially offset by lower volatility. 
    
  Other revenue was   $148 million   compared with   $129 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $130 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both comparisons reflect increased payments from Investment Management related to higher money market fees,  

BNY Mellon   21    

and termination fees related to lost business in our clearing services business.  The increase compared with the third quarter of 2015 was partially offset by certain fees paid to introducing brokers and lower financing-related fees.  The increase compared with the second quarter of 2016 also reflects higher financing-related fees. 
    
  Net interest revenue was   $715 million   compared with   $662 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $690 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The increase compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects the impact of the first quarter of 2016 changes in the internal crediting rates for deposits.  The increase compared with the second quarter of 2016 primarily reflects higher asset yields and lower interest on deposits. 
    
  Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was   $1.81 billion   compared with   $1.85 billion     in the     third quarter of 2015   and   $1.82 billion   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects lower other and legal expenses.  Both  

decreases also reflect lower sub-custodian and business development expenses, partially offset by higher incentive expenses and the annual employee merit increase. 
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Income before taxes totaled   $2.8 billion   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared with   $2.5 billion   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  Income before taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) increased   $333 million  .  Fee and other revenue increased   $47 million  , or   1%  , compared with the   first nine months of 2015   primarily reflecting higher investment services fees and other revenue, partially offset by lower foreign exchange and other trading revenue.  The   $126 million   increase in net interest revenue primarily reflects the impact of changes in the internal crediting rates for deposits.  Noninterest expense, excluding intangible amortization, decreased   $148 million   primarily due to lower litigation, professional, legal and other purchased services and sub-custodian expenses. 

Other segment 

See page 20 of our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q for a description of the Other segment. 
    
  Review of financial results  
    
  Total fee and other revenue   increased     $41 million   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   $5 million   compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both   increase  s primarily reflect higher asset-related  

gains.  The   increase   compared with the third quarter of 2015 also reflects the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activities and higher fixed income trading. 
    
  Net interest revenue   decreased     $37 million   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   $18 million   compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  Both   decrease  s were driven by the results of the leasing  

22   BNY Mellon 

portfolio inclusive of changes to internal transfer pricing in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $20 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   primarily reflecting a net recovery of $13 million recorded in the financial institutions portfolio.  The recovery reflects the receipt of trust assets from the bankruptcy proceedings of Sentinel in excess of the carrying value. 
    
  Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, M I and restructuring charges (recoveries),   decreased     $9 million   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   and   increased     $35 million   compared with the   second quarter of 2016  .  The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2015 primarily reflects lower furniture and equipment and net occupancy expenses, partially offset by higher other expense.  The increase compared with the second quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the annual employee merit increase and higher professional, legal and other purchased services. 
    
  Year-to-date 2016 compared with year-to-date 2015 
    
  Income before taxes in the Other segment was   $42 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   compared with   $58 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  .  Total revenue   decreased     $20 million   primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activities and higher fixed income trading revenue.  Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, M I and restructuring charges,   decreased     $2 million   primarily reflecting lower equipment expense and professional, legal and other purchased services partially offset by higher staff expense. 

Critical accounting estimates 
    
  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report.  Our critical accounting estimates are those related to the allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments, fair value of financial instruments and derivatives, other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ), goodwill and other intangibles, and pension accounting, as referenced below. 

Consolidated balance sheet review 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , total assets were   $374 billion   compared with   $394 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease in total assets was primarily driven by lower customer deposits.  Deposits totaled   $261 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $280 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , total interest-bearing deposits were   49%   of total interest-earning assets, compared with 54% at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  Total assets averaged   $351 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared with   $373 billion   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $374 billion   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year and sequential decreases in average total assets were primarily driven by lower levels of deposits and federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. 
    
  Total deposits averaged   $237 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared with   $255 billion   in the   third quarter of 2015   and   $249 billion   in the   second quarter of 2016  .  The year-over-year decrease in average total deposits primarily reflects a decrease in deposits located in foreign offices and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher time deposits.  The sequential decrease primarily reflects a decrease in deposits located in foreign offices, noninterest-bearing deposits and time deposits. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , we had   $49 billion   of liquid funds (which include interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements) and   $86 billion   of cash (including   $80 billion   of overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks) for a total of   $135 billion   of available funds.  This compares with available funds of   $159 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease in available funds primarily reflects the decrease of overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. 

BNY Mellon   23    

Total available funds as a percentage of total assets was   36%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with 40% at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Of the   $49 billion   in liquid funds held at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   $14 billion   was placed in interest-bearing deposits with large, highly-rated global financial institutions with a weighted-average life to maturity of approximately 43 days.  Of the   $14 billion  , $4 billion was placed with banks in the Eurozone.    
    
  Investment securities were   $119.0 billion  , or   32%   of total assets, at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $119.2 billion  , or   30%   of total assets, at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects decreases in Agency RMBS, sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed securities, other asset-backed securities, state and political subdivisions, other RMBS and commercial MBS, partially offset by increases in Agency commercial MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. 
    
  Loans were   $66.0 billion  , or   18%   of total assets, at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $63.7 billion  , or   16%   of total assets, at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The increase  primarily reflects higher overdrafts, wealth management loans and mortgages and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by lower margin loans and loans to financial institutions. 
    
  Long-term debt totaled   $24.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016     and   $21.5 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The increase reflects the issuance of   $5.0 billion   of senior debt, including $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2016, and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt, partially offset by the maturity of   $2.45 billion   of long-term debt, including $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2016.    
    
  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders  equity increased to   $39.7 billion   from   $38.0 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .    The increase primarily reflects earnings retention, issuance of preferred stock, approximately $383 million resulting from stock awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued for employee benefit plans, and an increase in the unrealized gain on our investment securities portfolio.  The increase was partially offset by share repurchases and foreign currency translation adjustments. 

Country risk exposure 
    
  We have exposure to certain countries and territories that have had a heightened focus due to recent events.   

Where appropriate, we offset the credit risk associated with the exposure in these countries with collateral that has been pledged, which primarily consists of cash or marketable securities, or by transferring the risk to a third-party guarantor in another country or territory.  Exposure described below reflects the country of operations and risk of the immediate counterparty.  We continue to monitor our exposure to these and other countries as part of our Risk Management process.  See  Risk management  in our 2015 Annual Report for additional information on how our exposures are managed. 
    
  BNY Mellon has a limited economic interest in the performance of assets of consolidated investment management funds, and therefore they are excluded from this disclosure. 
    
  Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece 
    
  Over the past several years, there have been concerns about European sovereign debt and its impact on the European banking system, as a number of European countries, including Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, experienced credit deterioration.  We had total net exposure to Italy and Spain of $3.8 billion at   Sept. 30, 2016   including $1.5 billion to Italy and $2.3 billion to Spain.  The total net exposure was $3.6 billion at   Dec. 31, 2015  , including $1.6 billion to Italy and $2.0 billion to Spain.  Exposure to Italy and Spain at both periods primarily consisted of investment grade sovereign debt and European Floating Rate notes.  At both   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , investment securities exposure totaled $1.4 billion in Italy and $2.0 billion in Spain.  At both   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  ,   BNY Mellon had exposure of less than $1 million to Portugal and Greece.     
    
  Brazil 
    
  Current conditions in Brazil have resulted in increased focus on its economic and political stability.  We have operations in Brazil providing investment services and investment management services.  In addition, at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , we had total net exposure to Brazil of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.  This included $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, in loans, which are primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial institutions.  At Sept. 30, 2016, we held $71 million of noninvestment grade sovereign  

24   BNY Mellon 

debt and at Dec. 31, 2015, we held $95 million of investment grade sovereign debt.      
    
  Other countries and territories    
    
  Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on exposures to Turkey, Russia and Puerto Rico.      Related to Turkey, we mainly provide treasury and issuer services, as well as foreign exchange products to the top-ten largest financial institutions in the country.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   our exposure totaled $727 million, consisting primarily of syndicated credit facilities and trade finance loans.      At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , our exposure to Russia was $66 million and $63 million, respectively.      Related to Puerto Rico, BNY Mellon had margin loan  

exposure that was collateralized with a concentration of Puerto Rican securities.  The margin loan exposure was approximately $35 million and $50 million, at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  .    

Investment securities 
    
  In the discussion of our investment securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed.  Significant changes in ratings classifications for our investment securities portfolio could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by a reduction in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.   

The following table shows the distribution of our total investment securities portfolio. 

(a) 
    Amortized cost before impairments. 
              (b) 
    Primarily consists of exposure to UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. 
              (c) 
    These RMBS were included in the former Grantor Trust and were marked-to-market in 2009.  We believe these RMBS would receive higher credit ratings if these ratings incorporated, as additional credit enhancements, the difference between the written-down amortized cost and the current face amount of each of these securities. 
              (d) 
    Includes RMBS and commercial MBS.  Primarily consists of exposure to UK and Netherlands. 
              (e) 
    Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, UK, Norway and Netherlands. 

The fair value of our total investment securities portfolio was   $118.7 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with $118.8 billion at   Dec. 31, 2015  .    The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in sovereign  

debt/sovereign guaranteed and consumer ABS, partially offset by an increase in commercial MBS. 

BNY Mellon   25    

At   Sept. 30, 2016  , the total investment securities portfolio had a net unrealized pre-tax gain of   $1.4 billion   compared with $357 million at   Dec. 31, 2015  , including the impact of related hedges.  The increase in the net unrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by a decrease in market interest rates. 
    
  The unrealized gain net of tax on our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio included in accumulated other comprehensive income was   $517  

million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $329 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   91%   of the securities in our portfolio were rated AAA/AA- compared with 90% at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  
    
  We routinely test our investment securities for OTTI.  See  Critical accounting estimates  for additional information regarding OTTI. 

The following table presents the amortizable purchase premium (net of discount) related to the investment securities portfolio and accretable discount related to the 2009 restructuring of the investment securities portfolio. 

(a) 
    Amortization of purchase premium decreases net interest revenue while accretion of discount increases net interest revenue.  Both were recorded on a level yield basis. 

The following table presents pre-tax net securities gains (losses) by type. 

On a quarterly basis, we perform our impairment analysis using several factors, including projected loss severities and default rates.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , this analysis resulted in other-than-temporary credit losses of $1 million primarily in our non-agency RMBS portfolio.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , if we were to increase or decrease each of our projected loss severities and default rates by 100 basis points on each of the positions in our non-agency RMBS portfolio, including the securities previously held by the Grantor Trust, credit-related impairment charges  

on these securities would have increased or decreased by less than $1 million (pre-tax).  See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities.   
    
  The following table shows the fair value of the European floating rate notes by geographical location at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  The unrealized loss on these securities was   $18 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with $24 million at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

(a) 
    71%   of these securities are in the AAA to AA- ratings category. 

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of securities by level in the fair value hierarchy. 

26   BNY Mellon 

Loans    

At   Sept. 30, 2016  , total exposures were   $123.5 billion  , a slight increase compared with   Dec. 31, 2015  .    Increases in overdrafts and the wealth management loans and mortgages portfolio were offset by decreases in margin loans and exposure in the financial institutions and commercial portfolios. 

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios comprise our largest concentrated risk.  These portfolios comprised   57%   of our total lending exposure at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   59%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Additionally, a substantial portion of our overdrafts relate to financial institutions. 

Financial institutions 
    
  The financial institutions portfolio is shown below. 

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was   $50.8 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $51.9 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects lower loans in the banks portfolio and lower unfunded commitments in the government portfolio, partially offset by an increase in exposure in the securities industry portfolio. 
    
  Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with   93%   of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating classification at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  Each customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to  

an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon a number of dimensions which are continually evaluated and may change over time.  The exposure to financial institutions is generally short-term.  Of these exposures,   83%   expire within one year and   60%   expire within 90 days.  In addition,   79%   of the financial institutions exposure is secured.  For example, securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 
    
  For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is generally capped at a rating equivalent  

BNY Mellon   27    

to the sovereign rating of the country where the counterparty resides regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying collateral. 
    
  Our bank exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance.  These exposures are short-term in nature with 86% due in less than one year.  The investment grade percentage of our bank exposure was 70% at Sept. 30, 2016, compared with 86% at Dec. 31, 2015.  The decrease in the investment grade percentage reflects the impact of the downgrade in  

the sovereign rating of Brazil to noninvestment grade.  Our exposure in Brazil includes $1.6 billion in loans, which are primarily short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial institutions.    
    
  The asset manager portfolio exposures are high-quality with   99%   of the exposures meeting our investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of   Sept. 30, 2016  .  These exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with the vast majority to regulated mutual funds.  

Commercial 
    
  The commercial portfolio is presented below. 

The commercial portfolio exposure decreased to   $19.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , from   $20.5 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  , primarily reflecting decreases in all portfolios except for the manufacturing portfolio. 
    
  Utilities-related exposure represents approximately three-quarters of the energy and utilities portfolio.  The remaining exposure in the energy and utilities portfolio, which includes exposure to refining, integrated companies, exploration and production companies and pipelines, was 78% investment grade at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with 94% at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the percentage of the financial institutions and commercial portfolio exposures that are investment grade. 

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services.  The execution of our strategy has resulted in   93%   of our financial institutions portfolio and   94%   of our commercial portfolio rated as investment grade at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  
    
  Wealth management loans and mortgages  
    
  Our wealth management exposure was   $16.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $14.9 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Wealth management loans and mortgages primarily consist of loans to high net worth individuals, which are secured by marketable securities and/or residential property.  Wealth management mortgages are primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of   61%   at origination.  In the wealth management portfolio, less than   1%   of the mortgages were past due at   Sept. 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic concentrations:  California -   24%  ; New York -   20%  ;  Massachusetts -   12%  ; Florida -   7%  ; and other -   37%  . 

28   BNY Mellon 

Commercial real estate 
    
  Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are structured with moderate leverage based on existing cash flows.  Our commercial real estate lending activities also include construction and renovation facilities.  Our client base consists of experienced developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.  Loans are approved on the basis of existing or projected cash flows, and supported by appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.  Development loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in many instances, involve some level of recourse to the developer.  Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $  8.0 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with $  7.2 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   61%   of our commercial real estate portfolio was secured.  The secured portfolio is diverse by project type, with   46%   secured by residential buildings,   36%   secured by office buildings,   12%   secured by retail properties and   6%   secured by other categories.  Approximately   98%   of the unsecured portfolio consists of real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and real estate operating companies, which are both predominantly investment grade. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , our commercial real estate portfolio consists of the following concentrations: New York metro -   43%  ; REITs and real estate operating companies -   38%  ; and other -   19%  . 
    
  Lease financings 
    
  The leasing portfolio exposure totaled $  1.8 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with $  1.9 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , approximately   93%   of the leasing portfolio exposure was investment grade, or investment grade equivalent. 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , the lease financing portfolio consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket transportation equipment.   
    
  Other residential mortgages 
    
  The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled   $0.9 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $1.1 billion     Dec. 31, 2015  .  Included in this portfolio at   Sept. 30,  

2016   are   $236 million   of mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , the purchased loans in this portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of   76%   at origination and   13%   of the serviced loan balance was at least 60 days delinquent.  The properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage loans were located (in order of concentration) in California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland. 
    
  To determine the projected loss on the prime and Alt-A mortgage portfolios, we calculate the total estimated defaults of these mortgages and multiply that amount by an estimate of realizable value upon sale in the marketplace (severity). 
    
  Overdrafts 
    
  Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients.  Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within two business days. 
    
  Other loans 
    
  Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed income securities. 
    
  Margin loans 
    
  Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan.  Margin loans included   $7.2 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $7.8 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015   of loans related to a term loan program that offers fully collateralized loans to broker-dealers.  

Asset quality and allowance for credit losses 
    
  Over the past several years, we have improved our risk profile through greater focus on clients who are active users of our non-credit services, de-emphasizing broad-based loan growth.  Our primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded formal contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses. 

BNY Mellon   29    

The role of credit has shifted to one that complements our other services instead of as a lead product.  We believe credit solidifies customer relationships and, through a disciplined allocation of capital, we can  

earn acceptable rates of return as part of an overall relationship. 
    
  The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses. 

Net recoveries of     $13 million   in the   third quarter of 2016     were recorded in the financial institutions portfolio.  The recovery reflects the receipt of trust assets from the bankruptcy proceedings of Sentinel in excess of the carrying value of $171 million.    Net recoveries were $2 million in the   second quarter of 2016   and $1 million in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $19 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   driven by net recoveries of $13 million.  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $9 million   in the   second quarter of 2016   and   $1 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  The total allowance for credit losses was   $274 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   $275 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015   and   $280 million   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  The ratio of the total allowance for credit losses to non-margin loans was   0.57%   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   0.63%   at   Dec. 31, 2015   and   0.64%   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-margin loans was   0.31%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   0.36%   at   Dec. 31, 2015   and   0.42%   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  
    
  We had   $17.6 billion   of secured margin loans on our balance sheet at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $19.6 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015   and   $19.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2015  .  We have rarely suffered a loss on these types  

of loans and do not allocate any of our allowance for credit losses to them.  As a result, we believe that the ratio of total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represent management s estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit portfolio.  This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments.  For additional information on this process, see  Critical accounting estimates  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or management s judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 
    
  Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as discussed in  Critical accounting estimates  and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2015 Annual Report, we have allocated our allowance for credit losses as follows. 

30   BNY Mellon 

(a) 
    Includes the allowance for wealth management mortgages. 

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the loss.     

The credit rating assigned to each credit is a significant variable in determining the allowance.  If each credit were rated one grade better, the allowance would have decreased by $68 million, while if each credit were rated one grade worse, the allowance would have increased by $134 million.  Similarly, if the loss given default were one rating worse, the allowance would have increased by $45 million, while if the loss given default were one rating better, the allowance would have decreased by $37 million.  For impaired credits, if the net carrying value of the loans was 10% higher or lower, the allowance would have decreased or increased by less than $1 million, respectively. 

Nonperforming assets 
    
  The following table shows the distribution of nonperforming assets. 

Nonperforming assets were   $109 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $183 million   compared with   $292 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .    The   decrease   in nonperforming loans primarily reflects the receipt of trust assets from the bankruptcy proceedings of Sentinel.    

The nonperforming assets ratio was   0.17%   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   0.45%   at   June 30, 2016   and   0.46%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was   141.0%   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   55.6%   at   June 30, 2016   and   54.9%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The ratio of the total allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was   261.0%   at   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   98.6%   at   June 30, 2016   and   96.2%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The changes in these ratios at Sept. 30, 2016 compared with both prior periods reflect the decrease in nonperforming assets as a result of the recovery related to Sentinel. 

BNY Mellon   31    

Deposits 
    
  Total deposits were   $261.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , a decrease of   7%   compared with   $279.6 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease in deposits primarily reflects lower interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. offices. Noninterest-bearing deposits were   $105.6 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $96.3 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Interest-bearing deposits were   $155.8 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $183.3 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

Short-term borrowings 
    
  We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.  Certain other borrowings, for example, securities sold under repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as collateral. 
    
  See  Liquidity and dividends  for a discussion of long-term debt and liquidity metrics that we monitor. 
    
  Information related to federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements is presented below. 

Fluctuations of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements between periods resulted from changes in overnight borrowing opportunities.  The increase in the weighted-average rates for the   third quarter of 2016   compared with the   third quarter of 2015   primarily reflects the December 2015 increase in the Fed Funds effective rate.  

Information related to payables to customers and broker-dealers is presented below.   

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds awaiting re-investment and short sale proceeds payable on demand.  Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity levels and market volatility.   
    
  Information related to commercial paper is presented below. 

The Parent s commercial paper program was discontinued in August 2015.  In the first quarter of 2016, The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest bank subsidiary, began issuing commercial paper that matures within 364 days from date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment. 

32   BNY Mellon 

Information related to other borrowed funds is presented below.  

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses and borrowings under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries.  Overdrafts typically relate to timing differences for settlements.  Fluctuations in other borrowed funds balances primarily reflect changes in overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses. 

Liquidity and dividends 
    
  BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to rollover or issue new debt, especially during periods of market stress and in order to meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations.  Liquidity risk is the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected cash flows, without adversely affecting daily operations or our financial condition.  Liquidity risk can arise from cash flow mismatches, market constraints from the inability to convert assets to cash, inability to raise cash in the markets, deposit run-off, or contingent liquidity events.  We also  

manage liquidity risks on an intra-day basis, in a manner designed to ensure that we can access required funds during the business day to make payments or settle immediate obligations, often in real time.  Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal, and reputational risks also can affect BNY Mellon s liquidity risk profile and are considered in our liquidity risk framework. 
    
  The Parent s liquidity policy is to have sufficient unencumbered cash and cash equivalents on hand at each quarter-end to cover forecasted debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments for the following 18 month period, and to provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , the Parent was in compliance with this policy.  For additional information on our liquidity policy, see  Risk Management - Liquidity risk  in our 2015 Annual Report.  Our overall approach to liquidity management is further described in  Liquidity and dividends  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  We define available funds for internal liquidity management purposes as liquid funds (which include interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements), cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks.  The table below presents our total available funds including liquid funds at period-end and on an average basis.  The decrease in available funds at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   Dec. 31, 2015   primarily reflects a decrease in overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offset by an increase in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. 

BNY Mellon   33    

On an average basis for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   and the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  , non-core sources of funds, such as money market rate accounts, federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, commercial paper and other borrowings, were   $25.9 billion   for both periods.  Average foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based Investment Services business, were   $105.6 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $110.5 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  Domestic savings, interest-bearing demand and time deposits averaged   $47.8 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   and   $49.0 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  . The decrease primarily reflects lower demand deposits.  Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were   $16.9 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   and   $11.2 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.  Long-term debt averaged   $22.8 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   and   $20.6 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  Average  

noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to   $82.9 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   from   $86.5 billion   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  , reflecting a decrease in client deposits.   
    
  A significant reduction in our Investment Services business would reduce our access to deposits.  See  Asset/liability management  for additional factors that could impact our deposit balances. 
    
  Sources of liquidity 
    
  The Parent s three major sources of liquidity are cash on hand, access to the debt and equity markets and dividends from its subsidiaries. 
    
  The Parent had cash of   $9.5 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016  , compared with   $9.1 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  , an increase of   $430 million   primarily reflecting the issuance of long-term debt and preferred stock, partially offset by maturities of long-term debt, common stock repurchases and a net decrease in loans from subsidiaries. 

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as follows:

    Represents senior debt issuer default rating. 
     NR - Not rated. 

In October 2016, S P stated that in light of the resubmissions by the eight U.S. G-SIBs of their resolution plans, S P will include the ramifications of structural changes resulting from those resolution  

plans in its evaluations of the U.S. G-SIBs  credit profiles.  If S P determines that such structural     changes increase risks to our bondholders, our ratings could be negatively impacted.    

34   BNY Mellon 

In October 2016, Moody s noted that while the U.S. G-SIB resolution plans are likely to have moderately negative implications for creditors, Moody s did not believe that the specific disclosed features of the resolution plans would impact these issuers  ratings.    
    
  Long-term debt totaled   $24.4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016     and   $21.5 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The increase reflects the issuance of   $5.0 billion   of senior debt, including $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2016, and an increase in the fair value of hedged long-term debt, partially offset by the maturity of   $2.45 billion   of long-term debt, including $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2016.    
    
  In October 2016, we issued $750 million of floating rate senior notes maturing in 2023 at an annual interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 105 basis points and $500 million of senior subordinated medium-term notes maturing in 2028 at an annual interest rate of 3.00%.    
    
  In conjunction with our 2016 capital plan, on Aug. 1, 2016, we completed a $1 billion offering of preferred stock, $750 million of which satisfied the contingency for the repurchase of up to $560 million of common stock.  We issued 10,000 shares of Series F preferred stock, which have a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share.  Dividends on the Series F noncumulative perpetual preferred stock will be paid, if declared by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to 4.625% on each March 20 and September 20, commencing March 20, 2017, through and including Sept. 20, 2026; and a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 3.131% on each March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20, commencing Dec. 20, 2026.    See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our preferred stock. 
    
  The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest bank subsidiary, began issuing commercial paper in the first quarter of 2016.  The commercial paper matures within 364 days from date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.  The Parent s commercial paper program was discontinued in August 2015.    The average commercial paper borrowings were   $1.2 billion   (The Bank of New York Mellon) in the   third quarter of 2016   and   $2.2 billion   (Parent) in the   third quarter of 2015  .  There was no commercial paper outstanding at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

Subsequent to   Sept. 30, 2016  , our U.S. bank subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately   $4.8 billion  , without the need for a regulatory waiver.  Currently, The Bank of New York Mellon, our primary subsidiary, is no longer paying regular dividends to the Parent in order to increase its Tier 1 capital in advance of the SLR becoming effective.  In addition, at   Sept. 30, 2016  , non-bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of approximately   $1.3 billion  .    Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in  Supervision and Regulation - Capital Planning and Stress Testing - Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions  and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Pershing LLC, an indirect subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent.  Pershing LLC has eight separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $1.5 billion in aggregate. Average daily borrowing under these lines was $2 million, in aggregate, in the   third quarter of 2016  .  Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $250 million in aggregate in place for liquidity purposes, which are guaranteed by the Parent.  Average borrowings under these lines were $103 million, in aggregate, in the   third quarter of 2016  . 
    
  The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock plus qualifying trust preferred securities.  In short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is financed by parent company debt.  As the double leverage ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a company s cash flows in order to service interest payments and debt maturities.  BNY Mellon s double leverage ratio is managed in a range considering both the high level of unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank deposits and government securities), the Company s cash generating fee-based business model, with fees representing approximately 80% of revenue, and dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries.  Our double leverage ratio was   117.2%   at   Sept. 30, 2016    

BNY Mellon   35    

and   115.7%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  , and within the range targeted by management.     
    
  Uses of funds 
    
  The Parent s major uses of funds are payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in, and loans to, its subsidiaries. 
    
  Included in the 2016 capital plan was a 12% increase the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.19 per share.  This increased quarterly cash dividend was paid on Aug. 12, 2016.  Our common stock dividend payout ratio was   22%   for the   first nine months of 2016  .  The Federal Reserve s instructions for the 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis   Review ( CCAR ) provided that, for large bank holding companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income would receive particularly close scrutiny.  
    
  In   third quarter of 2016  , we repurchased   11.6 million   common shares at an average price of   $40.18   per common share for a total cost of   $464 million  .  
    
  Liquidity coverage ratio ( LCR ) 
    
  U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.      
    
  The following table presents the Company s consolidated HQLA and LCR as of   Sept. 30, 2016  . 

(a) 
    Primarily includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, sovereign securities, securities of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, investment-grade corporate debt and publicly traded common equity. 
              (b) 
    Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks. 
              (c) 
    Consolidated HQLA presented before haircuts.  After haircuts, consolidated HQLA totaled   $166 billion  . 
              (d) 
    Based on our interpretation of the final rule issued by the U.S. federal banking agencies to implement the LCR in the U.S. ( Final LCR Rule ). 

The U.S. LCR rules became effective on Jan. 1, 2015, and currently require BNY Mellon and our affected domestic bank subsidiaries to meet an LCR of 90%, increasing to 100% when fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2017.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , based on our interpretation of the Final LCR Rule, we believe we and our domestic bank subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable LCR requirements on a fully phased-in basis.  Following our review of the FDIC s revised brokered deposits FAQ issued on June 30, 2016, we do not believe this revised guidance will materially impact the LCR for us and our domestic bank subsidiaries.

  We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources under multiple stress scenarios.  Stress tests are based on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under unlikely but plausible events.  We perform these tests under various time horizons ranging from one day to one year in a base case, as well as supplemental tests to determine whether the Company s liquidity is sufficient for severe market events and firm-specific events.  Under our scenario testing program, the results of the tests indicate that the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
    
  Statement of cash flows 
    
  The following summarizes the activity reflected on the statement of cash flows.  While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets.  We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $1.6 billion   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $4.0 billion   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  In the   first nine months of   both   2016   and   2015  , cash flows from operations were principally the result of earnings and changes in trading activities.  Cash  

36   BNY Mellon 

flows from operations in the   first nine months of 2016   were partially offset by changes in accruals.  
    
  Cash provided by investing activities was   $21.1 billion   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   compared with cash used for investing activities of   $248 million   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  In the   first nine months of 2016  , the change in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks was a significant source of funds, partially offset by a change in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.  In the   first nine months of 2015  , purchases of securities, changes in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements and changes in loans were significant uses of funds, partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities available-for-sale and changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. 

Cash used for financing activities was   $24.2 billion   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $2.5 billion   in the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  .  In the   first nine months of 2016  , changes in deposits, changes in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, repayment of long-term debt and treasury stock repurchases were significant uses of funds, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt.  In the   first nine months of 2015  , the repayment of long-term debt, changes in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and treasury stock repurchases were significant uses of funds, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt, changes in payables to customers and broker-dealers and the issuance of preferred stock.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total shareholders  equity increased to   $39.7 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   from   $38.0 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .    The increase primarily reflects earnings retention, issuance of preferred stock, approximately $383 million resulting from stock awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued for employee benefit plans, and an increase in the unrealized gain on our investment securities portfolio.  The increase was  

partially offset by share repurchases and foreign currency translation adjustments.    
    
  The unrealized gain net of tax on our investment securities portfolio recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income was   $517 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $329 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The increase in the unrealized gain, net of tax, was primarily driven by a decline in market interest rates. 

BNY Mellon   37    

BNY Mellon s tangible common shareholders  equity to tangible assets of operations ratio (Non-GAAP) was   6.5%   at both   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  .  
    
  In conjunction with the Federal Reserve s non-objection to BNY Mellon s 2016 capital plan, in August 2016, we issued $1 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, $750 million of which satisfied the contingency for the repurchase of up to $560 million of common stock in connection with our 2016 plan.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , we repurchased   11.6 million   common shares at an average price of   $40.18   per common share for a total cost of   $464 million  . 
    
  Also included in the 2016 capital plan was a 12% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.19 per share.  The first payment of the increased quarterly cash dividend was Aug. 12, 2016. 
    
  Capital adequacy 
    
  Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with established quantitative measurements.  For the Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding company, our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other things, qualify as  well capitalized.   
    
  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  ,     BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were  well capitalized.     As of   Dec. 31, 2015  , BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank subsidiaries, with the exception of BNY Mellon, N.A., were  well capitalized.   As of Dec. 31, 2015, BNY Mellon, N.A. was not  well capitalized  because its Total capital ratio was 9.89%, which was below the 10%  well capitalized  threshold.  With the filing of its March 31, 2016 Call Report, BNY Mellon, N.A. s Total capital ratio was 10.94%, which is above the 10%  well capitalized  threshold.    
    
  Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including  well capitalized  status or capital adequacy rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our financial condition.   

See the discussion of these matters in  Supervision and Regulation - Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements  and  Risk Factors - Operational and Business Risk - Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including  well capitalized  and  well managed  status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and financial condition.  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  The  well capitalized  and other capital categories (where applicable), as established by applicable regulations for bank holding companies and depository institutions, have been established by those regulations solely for purposes of implementing their respective requirements (for example, eligibility for financial holding company status in the case of bank holding companies and prompt corrective action measures in the case of depository institutions).  A bank holding company s or depository institution s qualification for a capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the entity s overall financial condition or prospects.    
    
  The U.S. banking agencies  capital rules have been based on the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as amended from time to time.  For additional information on these capital requirements, see  Supervision and Regulation  in our 2015 Annual Report.  BNY Mellon is subject to the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period through 2018. 
    
  Our estimated CET1 ratios on a fully phased-in basis are based on our current interpretation of the U.S. capital rules.  Our risk-based capital adequacy is determined using the higher of risk-weighted assets ( RWAs ) determined using the Advanced Approach and Standardized Approach.   
    
  The transitional capital ratios for Sept. 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 included in the table below were negatively impacted by the additional phase-in requirements that became effective on Jan. 1, 2016.    

38   BNY Mellon 

(b) 
    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.  The leverage capital ratio is based on Tier 1 capital, as phased-in and quarterly average total assets. 
              (c) 
    The Federal Reserve s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for bank holding companies. 
              (d) 
    The SLR does not become a binding measure until the first quarter of 2018.  The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital, as phased-in, and average quarterly assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
              (e) 
    Fully phased-in Basel III minimum with expected buffers.  See page   41   for the capital ratios with the phase-in of the capital conservation buffer and the estimated U.S. G-SIB surcharge, as well as the introduction of the SLR buffer. 

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced Approach was   10.5%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   10.8%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The decrease primarily reflects higher risk-weighted assets driven by higher operational risk RWAs, partially offset by an increase in capital. 
    
  Our estimated CET1 ratio (Non-GAAP) calculated under the Advanced Approach on a fully phased-in basis was   9.8%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   9.5%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Our estimated CET1 ratio (Non-GAAP) calculated under the Standardized Approach on a fully phased-in basis was   11.4%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   10.2%   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  The estimated fully phased-in SLR (Non-GAAP) of   5.7%   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   4.9%   at   Dec. 31, 2015    

was based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, as supplemented by the Federal Reserve s final rules on the SLR.    BNY Mellon will be subjected to an enhanced SLR, which will require a buffer in excess of 2% over the minimum SLR of 3%.    The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the U.S. G-SIBs, including those of BNY Mellon, must maintain a 6% SLR to be considered  well capitalized.     We expect our depository institutions to satisfy the 6%  well capitalized  threshold required for well-capitalized status when the SLR becomes effective as a binding ratio in 2018.

Requirements - Generally  in our 2015 Annual Report.   
    
  The Basel III Advanced Approach capital ratios are significantly impacted by RWAs for operational risk.  Our operational loss risk model is informed by external losses, including fines and penalties levied against institutions in the financial services industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a result external losses have impacted and could in the future impact the amount of capital that we are required to hold. 
    
  Management views the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon s capital position and progress against future regulatory capital standards.  Additionally, the presentation of the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies.  
    
  Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses.  As a consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may materially change, and may be volatile over time and from period to period. 
    
  Minimum capital ratios and capital buffers 
    
  The U.S. capital rules include a series of buffers and surcharges over required minimums that apply to bank holding companies, including BNY Mellon, which are being phased-in over time.  Banking organizations with a risk-based ratio or SLR above the minimum required level, but with a risk-based ratio or SLR below the minimum level with buffers will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary executive compensation based on  

the amount of the shortfall.  Different regulatory capital minimums, buffers and surcharges apply to our banking subsidiaries.    
    
  The U.S. capital rules introduced a capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer that add to the minimum regulatory capital ratios.  The capital conservation buffer - 0.625% for 2016 and 2.5% when fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2019 - is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and applies to all banking organizations.  During periods of excessive growth, the capital conservation buffer may be expanded through the imposition of a countercyclical capital buffer that may be as high as 2.5%.      The countercyclical capital buffer, when applicable, applies only to Advanced Approach banking organizations.  The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to zero with respect to U.S. exposures, but it could increase if the banking agencies determine that systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. 
    
  BNY Mellon is subject to an additional G-SIB surcharge, which will be implemented as an extension of the capital conservation buffer and must be satisfied with CET1 capital.  For 2016, the G-SIB surcharge applicable to BNY Mellon is 0.375% and, when fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2019 as calculated applying metrics as currently applicable to BNY Mellon, would be 1.5%.    
    
  The following table presents the minimum capital ratio requirements with buffers and surcharges, as phased-in, applicable to the Parent.  This table does not include the imposition of a countercyclical capital buffer.  The U.S. capital rules also provide for transitional arrangements for qualifying instruments, deductions, and adjustments, which are not reflected in this table.  Buffers and surcharges are not applicable to the leverage capital ratio.  These buffers, other than the SLR buffer, and surcharge began to phase-in on Jan. 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on Jan. 1, 2019.

At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   we had   $260 million     of outstanding trust preferred securities, a portion of which is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital.  Any decision to take action with respect to these trust preferred securities will be based on several considerations including interest rates, our credit spreads, the availability of cash and capital and compliance with our internal and regulatory requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital based capital ratios  .    
    
  Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at quarter-end and the level and types of investments in assets.  The balance sheet size fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on levels of customer and market activity.  In general, when servicing clients are more actively trading securities, deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are higher.  In addition, when markets experience significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase considerably as client deposit levels increase. 
    
  Supplementary Leverage Ratio 
    
  BNY Mellon has presented its consolidated and largest bank subsidiary s estimated fully phased-in SLRs based on its interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period and on the application of such rules to BNY Mellon s businesses as currently conducted.

              (b)  
    We expect our depository institutions to satisfy the 6%  well capitalized  threshold required for well-capitalized status when the SLR becomes effective as a binding ratio in 2018. 

Trading activities and risk management 
    
  Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the Volcker Rule.  The risk from market-making activities for customers is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure through a system of position limits, value-at-risk ( VaR ) methodology based on a Monte Carlo simulation and other market sensitivity measures.  The calculation of our VaR used by management and presented below assumes a one-day holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options.  See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the VaR methodology. 
    
  The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated periods. 

44   BNY Mellon 

(a) 
    VaR figures do not reflect the impact of the credit valuation adjustment ( CVA ) guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820.  This is consistent with the regulatory treatment.  VaR exposure does not include the impact of the Company s consolidated investment management funds and seed capital investments. 
     N/M - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification effect. 

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of interest rates.  These instruments include, but are not limited to: debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other interest rate derivative products. 
    
  The foreign exchange component of VaR represents instruments whose values predominantly vary with the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest rates.  These instruments include, but are not limited to: currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency options, exchange-traded futures and options, and other currency derivative products. 
    
  The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.  These instruments include, but are not limited to: common stock, exchange-traded funds, Depositary Receipts, listed equity options (puts and calls), over-the-counter ( OTC ) equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. 

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose values predominantly vary with the credit worthiness of counterparties.  These instruments include, but are not limited to, credit derivatives (credit default swaps and exchange traded credit index instruments).  Credit derivatives are used to hedge various credit exposures. 
    
  The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of risk factor movements. 
    
  During the   third quarter of 2016  , interest rate risk generated   59%   of average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated   34%   of average gross VaR, equity risk accounted for   5%   of average gross VaR and credit risk generated   2%   of average gross VaR.  During the   third quarter of 2016  , our daily trading loss exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio on one occasion.  
    
  The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past five quarters.  

(a) 
    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, derivatives, and securities trades for our customers and excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue. 

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and derivative assets, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.  Trading assets were   $5 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $7 billion     Dec. 31, 2015  .   
    
  Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and derivative liabilities, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.  Trading liabilities were   $4 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $5 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

BNY Mellon   45    

Under our   fair value methodology for     derivative contracts, an initial  risk-neutral  valuation is performed on each position assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit curve.  In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our derivatives.     
    
  We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable credit default swap spreads for both ourselves as well as our counterparties when measuring the fair value of our derivative positions.  Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as those of our counterparties.  
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , our OTC derivative assets of   $4.2 billion   included a CVA deduction of $57 million.  Our OTC derivative liabilities of   $4.3 billion   included a debit valuation adjustment ( DVA ) of $2 million related to our own credit spread.  Net of hedges, the CVA decreased by $8 million and the DVA decreased by $4 million in the   third quarter of 2016  .  The net impact of these adjustments increased foreign exchange and other trading revenue by $4 million in the   third quarter of 2016  .  
    
  In the   second quarter of 2016  , net of hedges, the CVA decreased $4 million and the DVA was unchanged.  The net impact of these adjustments increased foreign exchange and other trading revenue by $4 million in the   second quarter of 2016  . 
    
  In the   third quarter of 2015  , net of hedges, the CVA increased $5 million and the DVA was unchanged.  The net impact of these adjustments decreased foreign exchange and other trading revenue by $5 million in the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  The table below summarizes the risk ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparty credit exposure.  This information indicates the degree of risk to which we are exposed.  Significant changes in ratings classifications for our foreign exchange and other trading activity could result in increased risk for us. 

(a) 
    Represents credit rating agency equivalent of internal credit ratings. 

Asset/liability management 
    
  Our diversified business activities include processing securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, lending, raising money as needed to fund assets, and other transactions.  The market risks from these activities are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.  Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates.  We actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures.    
    
  An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue.  The model incorporates management s assumptions regarding interest rates, balance changes on core deposits, market spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.  These assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain.  As a result, the earnings simulation model cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest revenue.  Actual results may differ from projected results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in market conditions and management s strategies, among other factors.    
    
  As of Sept. 30, 2016, these scenarios reflect strategies that management could employ as interest rate expectations change.  The table below relies on certain critical assumptions regarding the balance sheet and depositors  behavior related to interest rate fluctuations and the prepayment and extension risk in  

46   BNY Mellon 

certain of our assets.  Generally, there has been an inverse relationship between interest rates and client deposit levels.  To the extent that actual behavior is different from that assumed in the models, there could be a change in interest rate sensitivity.    
    
  We evaluate the effect on earnings by running various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario.   

The interest rate ramp scenarios are reviewed to examine the impact of large interest rate movements.  Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.   

The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY Mellon.    

(a) 
    In the parallel rate ramp, both short-term and long-term rates move   in four equal quarterly increments. 
              (b) 
    Long-term is equal to or greater than one year. 
     bps - basis points. 

The   Sept. 30, 2016     calculations in the estimated changes in net interest revenue table above are based on a forecast that uses our quarter-end balance sheet and forward yield curves.  The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes rates increase 25 basis points above the forward yield curve in each of the next four quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario assumes a 50 basis point per quarter increase.    
    
  Our net interest revenue sensitivity table above incorporates assumptions about the impact of changes in interest rates on depositor behavior based on historical experience.  Given the current historically low interest rate environment and the potential change to implementation of monetary policy, the impact of depositor behavior is highly uncertain.  The lower sensitivity in the ramp up 200 basis point scenario compared with the 100 basis point scenario is driven by the assumption of increased deposit runoff at those higher interest rates and a reduction in corresponding investments. 
    
  Growth or contraction of deposits could also be affected by the following factors:    

Monetary policy;    
                
    Global economic uncertainty;    
                
    Our ratings relative to other financial institutions  ratings; and    
                
    Money market mutual fund and other regulatory reform.    

Any of these events could change our assumptions about depositor behavior and have a significant impact on our balance sheet and net interest revenue.    

Off-balance sheet arrangements 
    
  Off-balance sheet arrangements discussed in this section are limited to guarantees, retained or contingent interests and obligations arising out of unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ).  For BNY Mellon, these items include certain credit guarantees and securitizations.  Guarantees include lending-related guarantees issued as part of our corporate banking business and securities lending indemnifications issued as part of our Investment Services business.  See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.

Supplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures 
    
  BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP financial measures based on fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, the fully phased-in SLR and tangible common shareholders  equity.  BNY Mellon believes that the CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, the SLR on a fully phased-in basis and the ratio of tangible common shareholders  equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, required by regulatory authorities.  The tangible common shareholders  equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, includes changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders  equity.  In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its reconciliation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes and the assets of consolidated investment management funds to which BNY Mellon has limited economic exposure.  Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income.  BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding. 
    
  BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures, which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, and  

expense measures, which exclude M I, litigation and restructuring charges, and amortization of intangible assets.  Earnings per share, return on equity, operating leverage and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, as well as the recovery related to Sentinel, are also presented.  Operating margin measures may also exclude the provision for credit losses and the net negative impact of money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense.  BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon s control.  M I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction.  Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees.  Restructuring charges relate to our streamlining actions, Operational Excellence Initiatives and migrating positions to Global Delivery Centers.  Excluding these charges mentioned above permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business.  
    
  The presentation of income (loss) from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business.  BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. 
    
  Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows       Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ),  Statement of Cash Flows       Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU provides guidance on eight specific cash flow presentation issues and is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Earlier application is permitted, however all of the amendments must be adopted in the same period.  BNY Mellon is assessing the impacts of the new standard, but would not expect this ASU to materially affect the results of operations or financial condition.    
    
  ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments       Credit Losses 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,  Financial Instruments         Credit Losses.   This ASU introduces a new current expected credit losses model, which will apply to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The guidance would also change current practice for the impairment model for AFS debt securities.  The AFS debt securities model will require the use of an allowance to record estimated credit losses and subsequent recoveries.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2019.  Earlier application is permitted after Dec. 15, 2018.  BNY Mellon is assessing the impacts of the new standard.     
    
  ASU 2016-09, Compensation       Stock Compensation 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,  Compensation         Stock Compensation.   This standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after Dec. 15, 2016.  The adoption of the ASU will result in increased volatility to the Company s income tax expense but is not expected to  

have a material impact on the Company s balance sheet or equity.  
    
  ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  which clarifies the guidance in determining revenue recognition as principal versus agent.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which provides guidance in accounting for immaterial performance obligations and shipping and handling.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which provides clarification on assessing the collectability criterion, presentation of sales taxes, measurement date for noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition.  This ASU also provides a practical expedient for contract modifications. 
    
  The new standards are effective for the Company on Jan. 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted no earlier than Jan. 1, 2017.  The standards permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition  
  method.  The Company is evaluating the effect that these ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of these standards on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  ASU 2016-07, Investments       Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,  Investments       Equity Method and Joint Ventures,  which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method when an increase in ownership interest in the investee prompts a change from the cost method to the equity method.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after Dec. 15,  

BNY Mellon   53    

2016.  Earlier application is permitted.  The Company will apply this ASU prospectively beginning in 2017. 
    
  ASU 2016-02, Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.   The standard introduces a new accounting model for lessees and was issued primarily to address concerns related to off-balance sheet financing arrangements available to lessees under current guidance.  The standard requires lessees to account for all leases on the balance sheet, except for certain short-term leases that have a maximum possible lease term of 12 months.  A lessee will recognize on its balance sheet (1) an asset for its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term, including optional payment periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option and (2) a liability representing its obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.  The classification of leases and the income statement impact for lessees will depend on whether the leases meet certain criterion, including when the lessee is deemed to obtain effective control of the underlying asset.  The accounting for lessors is largely unchanged from the previous accounting guidance, except for leverage lease accounting which is not permitted for leases entered into or modified after the effective date of the new standard.  The FASB requires a modified retrospective method of adoption.  The final guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2018.  BNY Mellon is assessing the impacts of the new standard. 
    
  ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The new ASU requires investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, unless one of two available exceptions apply.  The first exception, a scope exception, allows Federal Reserve Bank Stock, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and other exchange memberships held by broker dealers to remain accounted for at cost, less impairment.  It also does not apply to derivative instruments that are subject to the requirements of ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  .  The second exception, a practicability exception, will be available  

for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820  , Fair Value Measurement  .  
    
  The amendments also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from the entity s  own credit risk  when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value.  The amendments also eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments measured at amortized cost that are on the balance sheet. 
    
  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  If certain requirements are met, early adoption of the  own credit risk  provision is permitted; early adoption of the other provisions is not permitted.  The FASB requires a modified retrospective method of adoption.  BNY Mellon is assessing the impacts of the new standard. 
    
  Recent regulatory developments 
    
  For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to our operations, see  Supervision and regulation  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Resolution plan 
    
  In April 2016, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve jointly announced that the Agencies had determined that the Company s 2015 resolution plan was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the statutory standard established in the Dodd-Frank Act, and issued a joint notice of deficiencies and shortcomings regarding the Company s plan and the actions that must be taken to address them.  As required, we made an Oct. 1, 2016 submission to the agencies, which provided our plans to address the shortcomings and, we believe, addressed all of the deficiencies identified by the agencies.   
    
  Following the receipt of the agencies  April 2016 feedback, we have changed our preferred resolution strategy in the event of our material financial distress or failure to an SPOE strategy.  We currently believe that this requires us to issue approximately $2 - $4 billion of incremental unsecured long-term debt  

54   BNY Mellon 

above our typical funding requirements by July 2017 to satisfy resource needs in a time of distress.  This estimate is subject to change as we further refine our strategy and related assumptions.  The additional debt is currently expected to have a modest negative impact to net interest revenue. 
    
  Cyber security regulatory proposals    
    
  On Sept. 13, 2016, the New York State Department of Financial Services ( NYSDFS ) proposed a new cybersecurity regulation.  The proposed rule would require financial institutions regulated by NYSDFS, including BNY Mellon, to establish a cybersecurity program, adopt a written cybersecurity policy, designate a chief information security officer, and have policies and procedures in place to ensure the security of information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by, third parties.  The proposed rule also includes a variety of other requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems.    
    
  Following the NYSDFS proposal, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ) approved a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose enhanced cyber risk management standards on banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and certain of their service providers.  The standards address five categories:     

cyber risk governance;    
                
    cyber risk management;    
                
    internal dependency management;    
                
    external dependency management; 
                
    incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.     
       
  The agencies are also considering proposing more stringent  Sector Critical Standards  that would apply to systems  deemed critical to the financial sector . BNYM is monitoring further developments with respect to both the NYSDFS and federal agency rulemaking in this area.    

SEC rules on mutual funds 
  On Oct. 13, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) adopted regulations that impose new requirements on mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other registered investment companies.  The new rules would require mutual funds (other than money market funds) to provide portfolio-wide and position-level holdings data to the SEC on a monthly basis.  This data would include the pricing of portfolio securities, information regarding repurchase and securities lending activities, and the terms of derivatives contracts.  Information contained in reports for the last month of each fund s fiscal quarter would be made available to the public within 60 days of the end of the relevant quarter. 
  The new rules also impose liquidity risk management requirements that are intended to reduce the risk that funds will not be able to meet shareholder redemptions and to minimize the impact of redemptions on remaining shareholders.  Each fund would be required to establish a liquidity risk management program; classify the investments in its portfolio into one of four liquidity categories; maintain a highly liquid investment minimum; and limit illiquid investments to 15 percent of net assets. The new rules also permit funds to use swing pricing in certain circumstances.  The compliance dates for the reporting requirements depend on the applicable reporting form.  Most funds would be required to comply with the liquidity risk management requirements by Dec. 1, 2018.  The SEC has delayed the effective date of the swing pricing amendments. BNY Mellon is evaluating the cost of compliance and the impact of the new regulations on its activities. 
    
  Proposed changes to CCAR rules 
    
  On Sept. 26, 2016, the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking ( NPR ) that would introduce several changes to the 2017 CCAR cycle, including by:  (i) reducing the de minimis exception for additional capital distributions from 1.00% of a BHC s Tier 1 capital to 0.25%; (ii) introducing  blackout periods  for notices regarding or requests for approval to make additional capital distributions; and (iii) extending the range of dates from which the Federal Reserve may select the  as of  date for the global market shock component of the supervisory stress test macroeconomic scenarios applicable to certain bank holding companies.  Comments on this NPR are due Nov. 25, 2016.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 - Basis of presentation  
    
  Basis of presentation 
    
  The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and prevailing industry practices.     
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with BNY Mellon s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.  
    
  Use of estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based upon assumptions about future economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements.  Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Amounts subject to estimates are items such as the allowance for loan losses and lending-related commitments, the fair value of financial instruments and derivatives, other-than-temporary impairment, goodwill and other intangibles and pension accounting.  Among other effects, such changes in estimates could result in future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets and establishment of allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments as well as changes in pension and post-retirement expense. 

Note 2 - Acquisitions and dispositions 
    
  We sometimes structure our acquisitions with both an initial payment and later contingent payments tied to post-closing revenue or income growth.  There were   no   contingent payments in the   third quarter of 2016   and   $4 million   in the   first nine months of 2016  . 
    
  At     Sept. 30, 2016  , we are potentially obligated to pay additional consideration     which, using reasonable assumptions, could range from   $0 million   to   $20 million     over the next     three years  , but could be higher as certain of the arrangements do not contain a contractual maximum.      The acquisitions and disposition described below did   not have a material impact on BNY Mellon s results of operations. 
    
  Acquisition in 2016 
    
  On   April 1, 2016  , BNY Mellon acquired the assets of Atherton Lane Advisers, LLC, a U.S.-based investment manager with approximately   $2.45 billion   in assets under management and servicer for approximately   700   high net worth clients, for cash of   $38 million  , plus contingent payments measured at   $22 million  .  Goodwill related to this acquisition totaled   $29 million   and is included in the Investment Management business.  The customer relationship intangible assets related to this acquisition is included in the Investment Management business, with an estimated life of   14 years  , and totaled   $30 million   at acquisition. 
    
  Acquisition in 2015 
    
  On Jan. 2, 2015, BNY Mellon acquired Cutwater Asset Management, a U.S.-based, fixed income and solutions specialist with approximately   $23 billion   in assets under management. 
    
  Disposition in 2015 
    
  On   July 31, 2015  , BNY Mellon sold Meriten Investment Management GmbH ( Meriten ), a German-based investment management boutique, for   $40 million  .  As a result of this sale, we recorded an after-tax loss of   $12 million  .  Goodwill of   $22 million   and customer relationship intangible assets of   $9 million   were removed from the balance sheet as a result of this sale.

Note 3 - Securities 
    
  The following tables present the amortized cost, the gross unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of securities at   Sept. 30, 2016   and Dec. 31,   2015  . 

(a) 
    Previously included in the Grantor Trust.  The Grantor Trust was dissolved in 2011. 
              (b) 
    Includes gross unrealized gains of   $68 million   and gross unrealized losses of   $204 million   recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to investment securities that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.  The unrealized gains and losses primarily are related to Agency RMBS and will be amortized into net interest revenue over the estimated lives of the securities.

              (b)

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

The following table presents the gross securities gains, losses and impairments. 

Temporarily impaired securities 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , the unrealized losses on the investment securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates from date of purchase, and for certain securities that were  

transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates through the date they were transferred.  Specifically,   $204 million   of the unrealized losses at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $248 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015   reflected in the available-for-sale sections of the tables below relate to certain securities (primarily Agency RMBS) that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.  The unrealized losses will be amortized into net interest revenue over the estimated lives of the securities.  The transfer created a new cost basis for the securities.  As a result, if these securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date of transfer, the corresponding fair value and unrealized losses would be reflected in the held-to-maturity sections of the following tables.  We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell these securities. 

The following tables show the aggregate related fair value of investments with a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

(a) 
    Previously included in the Grantor Trust.  The Grantor Trust was dissolved in 2011. 
              (b) 
    Gross unrealized losses for 12 months or more of   $204 million   were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and related to investment securities that were transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.  The unrealized losses primarily related to Agency RMBS and will be amortized into net interest revenue over the estimated lives of the securities.  There were   no   gross unrealized losses for less than 12 months.

Other-than-temporary impairment 
    
  We routinely conduct periodic reviews of all securities to determine whether OTTI has occurred.  Such reviews may incorporate the use of economic models.  Various inputs to the economic models are used to determine if an unrealized loss on securities is other-than-temporary.  For example, the most significant inputs related to non-agency RMBS are: 

Default rate - the number of mortgage loans expected to go into default over the life of the transaction, which is driven by the roll rate of loans in each performance bucket that will ultimately migrate to default; and 
                
    Severity - the loss expected to be realized when a loan defaults. 
       
  To determine if an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) in order to determine the projected collateral loss.  In determining estimated default rate and severity assumptions, we review the performance of the underlying securities, industry studies, market forecasts, as well as our view of the economic outlook affecting collateral.  We also evaluate the current credit enhancement underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash flows.  If we determine that a given security will be subject to a write-down or loss, we record the expected credit loss as a charge to earnings.  
    
  The table below shows the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities for the 2007, 2006 and late 2005 non-agency RMBS and the securities previously held in the Grantor Trust that we established in connection with the restructuring of our investment securities portfolio in 2009, at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

The following table provides pre-tax net securities gains (losses) by type.  

The following tables reflect investment securities credit losses recorded in earnings.  The beginning balance represents the credit loss component for which OTTI occurred on debt securities in prior periods.  The additions represent the first time a debt security was credit impaired or when subsequent credit impairments have occurred.  The deductions represent credit losses on securities that have been sold, are required to be sold, or for which it is our intention to sell. 

Pledged assets 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , BNY Mellon had pledged assets of   $104 billion  , including   $86 billion   pledged as collateral for potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window.  The components of the assets pledged at   Sept. 30, 2016   included   $90 billion   of securities,   $8 billion   of loans,   $4 billion   of interest-bearing deposits with banks and   $2 billion   of trading assets. 
    
  If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally  

BNY Mellon   67    

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

allows banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged assets account to sell or repledge the assets for other purposes.  BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve. 
    
  At   Dec. 31, 2015  , BNY Mellon had pledged assets of   $101 billion  , including   $84 billion   pledged as collateral for potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window.  The components of the assets pledged at   Dec. 31, 2015   included   $88 billion   of securities,   $8 billion   of loans,   $3 billion   of trading assets and   $2 billion   of interest-bearing deposits with banks.   
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , pledged assets included   $6 billion   and   $7 billion  , respectively, for which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the assets delivered. 
    
  We also obtain securities as collateral including receipts under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative contracts and custody agreements on terms which permit us to sell or repledge the securities to others.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , the market value of the securities received that can be sold or repledged was   $60 billion   and   $52 billion  , respectively.  We routinely sell or repledge these securities through delivery to third parties.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , the market value of securities collateral sold or repledged was   $20 billion   and   $17 billion  , respectively. 
    
  Restricted cash and securities 
    
  Cash and securities may also be segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , cash segregated under federal and other regulations or requirements was   $3 billion   and   $4 billion  , respectively.  Segregated cash is included in interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheet.  Securities segregated for these purposes were   $2 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $1 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Segregated securities were sourced from securities purchased under resale agreements at   Sept. 30, 2016   and are included in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements on the consolidated balance sheet.  Segregated securities are included in trading assets on the consolidated balance sheet at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  

Note 4 - Loans and asset quality 
    
  Loans 
    
  The table below provides the details of our loan portfolio and industry concentrations of credit risk at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

Our loan portfolio consists of three portfolio segments: commercial, lease financings and mortgages.  We manage our portfolio at the class level which consists of six classes of financing receivables: commercial, commercial real estate, financial institutions, lease financings, wealth management loans and mortgages and other residential mortgages.   
    
  The following tables are presented for each class of financing receivable, and provide additional information about our credit risks and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses.

Nonperforming assets 
    
  The table below presents the distribution of our nonperforming assets.  

At   Sept. 30, 2016  , undrawn commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or reduced rate were not material.  Nonperforming  

loans decreased primarily reflecting the settlement agreement in the bankruptcy proceedings of Sentinel.  

Lost interest 
    
  The table below presents the amount of lost interest income.

Impaired loans 
    
  The tables below provide information about our impaired loans.  We use the discounted cash flow method as the primary method for valuing impaired loans.  

(a) 
    When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the carrying value of the loan, then the loan does not require an allowance under the accounting standard related to impaired loans.

    The allowance for impaired loans is included in the allowance for loan losses. 
              (b) 
    When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the carrying value of the loan, then the loan does not require an allowance under the accounting standard related to impaired loans. 

Past due loans 
    
  The table below sets forth information about our past due loans.  

(a) 
    Substantially all of these past due loans have been repaid subsequent to Sept 30, 2016. 

Troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) 
    
    A modified loan is considered a TDR if the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor grants a concession to the debtor that would not otherwise be considered.  A TDR may include a  

transfer of real estate or other assets from the debtor to the creditor, or a modification of the term of the loan.  Not all modified loans are considered TDRs. 

The following table presents TDRs that occurred in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   second quarter of 2016   and   third quarter of 2015  . 

72   BNY Mellon 

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

Other residential mortgages 
    
  The modifications of the other residential mortgage loans in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   second quarter of 2016   and   third quarter of 2015   consisted of reducing the stated interest rates and, in certain cases, a forbearance of default and extending the maturity dates.  The modified loans are primarily collateral dependent for which the value is based on the fair value of the collateral.   
    
  TDRs that subsequently defaulted 
    
  There were   eight   residential mortgage loans and   one   wealth management loan that had been restructured in  

a TDR during the previous 12 months and have subsequently defaulted in the   third quarter of 2016  .  The total recorded investment of these loans was   $3 million  . 

Credit quality indicators 
    
  Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services.  Each customer is assigned an internal credit rating which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a number of dimensions which are continually evaluated and may change over time. 
    
  The following tables set forth information about credit quality indicators. 

Commercial loan portfolio 

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment grade and non-investment grade categories based on rating criteria largely consistent with those of the public rating agencies.  Each customer in the portfolio is assigned an internal credit rating.  These internal credit ratings are generally consistent with the ratings categories of the public rating agencies.  Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S P)/Baa3 (Moody s) or better are considered to be investment grade.  Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are considered to be non-investment grade. 
    
  Wealth management loans and mortgages 

Wealth management non-mortgage loans are not typically rated by external rating agencies.  A majority of the wealth management loans are secured by the customers  investment management accounts or custody accounts.  Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically investment grade, fixed-income securities, equities and/or mutual funds.  Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth management portfolio, therefore, would equate to investment grade external ratings.  Wealth management loans are provided to select customers based on the pledge of other types of assets, including business assets, fixed assets or a modest amount of commercial real estate.  For the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider this portfolio of loans to be investment grade. 
    
  Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages are not correlated to external ratings.  Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to high net worth individuals, which are secured primarily by residential property.  These loans are primarily interest-only, adjustable rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of   61%   at origination.  In the wealth management portfolio, less  

BNY Mellon   73    

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

than   1%   of the mortgages were past due at   Sept. 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic concentrations:  California -   24%  ; New York -   20%  ;  Massachusetts -   12%  ; Florida -   7%  ; and other -   37%  . 
    
  Other residential mortgages 
    
  The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $  901 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $1,055 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  These loans are not typically correlated to external ratings.  Included in this portfolio at   Sept. 30, 2016   are   $236 million   of mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  As of   Sept. 30, 2016  , the purchased loans in this portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of   76%   at origination and   13%   of the serviced loan balance was at least 60 days delinquent.  The properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage loans were located (in order of concentration) in California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland. 
    
  Overdrafts 
    
  Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients and totaled   $7,323 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $4,483 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within   two   business days. 
    
  Other loans 
    
  Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed income securities. 

Margin loans 
    
  We had   $17,557 million   of secured margin loans on our balance sheet at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $19,573 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of   100%   of the value of the loan.  We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans and do not allocate any of our allowance for credit losses to margin loans. 
    
  Reverse repurchase agreements 
    
  Reverse repurchase agreements are transactions fully collateralized with high-quality liquid securities.  These transactions carry minimal credit risk and therefore are not allocated an allowance for credit losses. 

Note 5 - Goodwill and intangible assets 
    
  Impairment testing 
    
  The goodwill impairment test is performed at least annually at the reporting unit level.  Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate they may be impaired. 
    
  BNY Mellon s   three   business segments include   eight   reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an annual basis.  In the   second quarter of 2016  , BNY Mellon conducted an annual goodwill impairment test on all   eight   reporting units.  The estimated fair value of the   eight   reporting units exceeded the carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recognized. 

Goodwill 
    
  The tables below provide a breakdown of goodwill by business.

              (c) 
    Other changes in goodwill include purchase price adjustments and certain other reclassifications. 

Intangible assets 
    
  The tables below provide a breakdown of intangible assets by business. 

(a) 
    Includes a   $3 million   impairment charge related to the write-down of the value of a customer contract intangible in the Investment Management business to its fair value.

    Includes Federal Reserve Bank stock of   $465 million   and   $453 million  , respectively, at cost.  

Certain seed capital and private equity investments valued using net asset value per share 
    
  In our Investment Management business, we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, money market and alternative investment funds for institutions and other investors.  As part of that activity, we make seed capital investments in certain funds.  BNY Mellon also holds private equity investments, specifically in small business investment companies ( SBICs ), which are compliant with the Volcker Rule.  Seed capital and private equity investments are included in other assets.  
    
  The fair value of certain of these investments has been estimated using the net asset value ( NAV ) per share of BNY Mellon s ownership interest in the funds.  The table below presents information about BNY Mellon s investments in seed capital and private equity investments that have been valued using NAV. 

(a) 
    Other funds include various leveraged loans, structured credit funds and hedge funds.  Redemption notice periods vary by fund. 
              (b) 
    Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy.  Private equity investments do not have redemption rights.  Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying investments in the private equity investments are liquidated. 
     N/A - Not applicable. 

Qualified affordable housing project investments 
    
  We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to satisfy the Company s requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act.  Our total investment in qualified affordable housing projects totaled   $890 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $918 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  Commitments to fund future investments in qualified affordable housing projects totaled   $366  

million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $393 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  A summary of the commitments to fund future investments is as follows:   2016     $146 million  ;   2017     $57 million  ;   2018     $113 million  ;   2019     $33 million  ;   2020     $5 million   and   2021   and thereafter   $12 million  . 
    
  Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were   $39 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   $33 million

  Amortization expense included in the provision for income taxes was   $30 million   in the   third quarter of  

2016  ,   $23 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  ,   $28 million   in the   second quarter of 2016  ,   $86 million   in the   first nine months of 2016   and   $74 million   in the   first nine months of 2015  .

Note 9 - Restructuring charges 
    
  BNY Mellon initiated   two   restructuring programs, Streamlining actions in 2014 and Operational Excellence Initiatives in 2011.  Additional details regarding these programs are presented in Note 9 - Restructuring charges, in our 2015 Annual Report.  Aggregate charges are included in M I, litigation and restructuring charges on the consolidated income statement.  Restructuring charges related to corporate-level initiatives and were therefore recorded in the Other segment.  Severance payments are primarily paid over the salary continuance period in accordance with the separation plan.   
    
  The following summarizes the restructuring activity for the   third quarter of 2016  .  There were   no   additional restructuring charges recorded in the   third quarter of 2016  .  For the Streamlining actions program, we utilized   $4 million   of the reserve in the   third quarter of 2016  .  The remaining reserve balance for the Streamlining actions program was   $7 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  .  For the Operational Excellence Initiatives program, we utilized   $1 million   of the reserve in the   third quarter of 2016  .  The remaining reserve balance for the Operational Excellence Initiatives program was   $3 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016  . 

Note 10 - Income taxes 
    
  BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of   $324 million   (  24.6%   effective tax rate) in the   third quarter of 2016   and   $282 million   (  25.4%   effective tax rate) in the   third quarter of 2015  .  Both effective tax rates primarily reflect benefits from foreign operations, tax-exempt income and tax credits. 
    
  Our total tax reserves as of   Sept. 30, 2016   were   $144 million   compared with   $178 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  If these tax reserves were unnecessary,   $144 million   would affect the effective tax rate in future periods.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if  

applicable, related to income taxes in income tax expense.  Included in the balance sheet at   Sept. 30, 2016   is accrued interest, where applicable, of   $18 million  .  The additional tax expense related to interest for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2016   was   $2 million   compared with   $4 million   for the   nine months ended Sept. 30, 2015  . 
    
  It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next 12 months by approximately   $23 million   as a result of adjustments related to tax years that are still subject to examination. 
    
  Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination through 2013.  Our New York State tax returns are closed to examination through 2012.  Our New York City income tax returns are closed to examination through 2010.  Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination through 2012.  

Note 11 - Securitizations and variable interest entities 
    
  BNY Mellon s VIEs generally include retail, institutional and alternative investment funds, including collateralized loan obligation structures in which we provide asset management services.  The funds are offered to our retail and institutional clients to provide them with access to investment vehicles with specific investment objectives and strategies that address the client s investment needs. 
    
  BNY Mellon earns management fees from these funds as well as performance fees in certain funds and may also provide start-up capital for its new funds.  The VIEs are primarily financed by our customers  investments in the funds  equity or debt.  These VIEs are included in the scope of ASU 2015-02 and are reviewed for consolidation based on the guidance in ASC 810. 

78   BNY Mellon 

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

We reconsider and reassess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed which would reallocate the obligation to absorb expected losses or receive expected residual returns between BNY Mellon and the other investors, when BNY Mellon disposes of its variable interests in the fund or when additional variable interests are issued to other investors and when we acquire additional variable interests in the VIE. 
    
  The following tables present the incremental assets and liabilities included in BNY Mellon s consolidated financial statements, after applying intercompany eliminations, as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , based on the assessments performed in accordance with ASC 810, as amended by ASU 2015-02.    The net assets of any consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities of the VIE and to settle any investors  ownership liquidation requests, including any seed capital invested in the VIE by BNY Mellon.

Note 12 - Preferred stock 
    
  BNY Mellon has   100 million   authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of   $0.01  .  The following table summarizes BNY Mellon s preferred stock issued and outstanding at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  . 

(a) 
    The carrying value of the Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F preferred stock is recorded net of issuance costs. 

Holders of both the Series A and Series C preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends on each dividend payment date (March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20 of each year), if declared by BNY Mellon s Board of Directors.  Holders of the Series D preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, if declared by our board of directors, on each June 20 and December 20, to but excluding June 20, 2023; and on each March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20, from and including June 20, 2023.  Holders of the Series E preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, if declared by our board of directors, on each June 20 and December 20, to and including June 20, 2020; and on each March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20, from and including September 20, 2020.  Holders of the Series F preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, if declared by our board of directors, on each March 20 and September. 20, commencing March 20, 2017, to and including Sept. 20, 2026; and on each March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20, commencing Dec. 20, 2026.  BNY Mellon s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to the preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of any assets on any  

liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of BNY Mellon will be prohibited, subject to   certain restrictions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full preferred dividends for the then current dividend period of the Series A preferred stock or the last preceding dividend period of the Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F preferred stock. 
    
  All of the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred stock are owned by Mellon Capital IV, which will pass through any dividend on the Series A preferred stock to the holders of its Normal Preferred Capital Securities.  All of the outstanding shares of the Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F preferred stock are held by the depositary of the depositary shares, which will pass through the applicable portion of any dividend on the Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F preferred stock to the holders of record of their respective depositary shares.     
    
  On Sept. 20, 2016, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation paid the following dividends for the noncumulative perpetual preferred stock for the dividend period ending in September 2016 to holders of record as of the close of business on Sept. 5, 2016:

$1,022.22   per share on the Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to   $10.2222   per Normal Preferred Capital Security of Mellon Capital IV, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Series A Preferred Stock); and 
        
  The preferred stock is not subject to the operation of a sinking fund and is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of our common stock or any other class or series of our other securities.  Subject to the restrictions in BNY Mellon s 2007 replacement capital covenant, subsequently amended on May 8 and Sept. 11, 2012, we may redeem the Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, at our option.

Note 14 - Fair value measurement 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  A three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.  BNY Mellon s own creditworthiness is considered when valuing liabilities.  See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report for information on how we determine fair value and the fair value hierarchy. 

The following tables present the financial instruments carried at fair value at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the three-level valuation hierarchy.  We have included credit ratings information in certain of the tables because the information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, and significant changes in ratings classifications could result in increased risk for us.  There were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   third quarter   of 2016.

    Previously included in the Grantor Trust.  The Grantor Trust was dissolved in 2011. 

Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements 
    
  Our classification of a financial instrument in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is based on the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement.  However, these instruments generally include other observable components that are actively quoted or validated to third-party sources; accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due to observable parameters as well as the unobservable parameters in our valuation methodologies.  We also frequently  

manage the risks of Level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivatives positions that are Level 1 or 2 instruments which are not included in the table; accordingly, the gains or losses below do not reflect the effect of our risk management activities related to the Level 3 instruments. 
    
  The Company has a Level 3 Pricing Committee which evaluates the valuation techniques used in determining the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities.

  Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to fair value our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis.  An example would be the recording of an impairment of an asset. 

The following tables present the financial instruments carried on the consolidated balance sheet by caption and by level in the fair value hierarchy as of   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the quarters ended   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  .

    During the quarters ended   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , the fair value of these loans decreased   $1 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral as allowed by ASC 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a loan, with an offset to the allowance for credit losses.

BNY Mellon   91    

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

Note 15 - Fair value option 
    
  We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets and financial liabilities.   
    
  The following table presents the assets and liabilities, by type, of consolidated investment management funds recorded at fair value. 

BNY Mellon values the assets and liabilities of its consolidated asset management funds using quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.  Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.  Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic performance of the consolidated asset management funds.  Changes in the value of the assets and liabilities are recorded in the income statement as investment income of consolidated investment management funds and in the interest of investment management fund note holders, respectively. 
    
  We have elected the fair value option on   $29 million   and   $419 million   of loans at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , respectively.  The fair value of these loans was   $29 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $422 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The loans were valued using observable market inputs to discount expected loan cash flows and are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  We have elected the fair value option on   $240 million   of long-term debt.  The fair value of this long-term debt was   $376 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $359 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  .  The long-term debt is  

valued using observable market inputs and is included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  The following table presents the changes in fair value of the loans and long-term debt and the location of the changes in the consolidated income statement. 

(a) 
    The changes in fair value of the loans and long-term debt are approximately offset by economic hedges included in foreign exchange and other trading revenue. 

Note 16 - Derivative instruments 
    
  We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk.  Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the Volcker Rule. 
    
  The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments express the dollar volume of the transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.  We perform credit reviews and enter into netting agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial instruments.  We enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risk. 
    
  Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on counterparties.  Failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative contract.  There were   no   counterparty default losses in the   third quarter of 2016   or the   third quarter of 2015  . 

92   BNY Mellon 

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

Hedging derivatives 
    
  We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  For hedges of available-for-sale investment securities, deposits and long-term debt, the hedge documentation specifies the terms of the hedged items and the interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is hedging a fixed rate item and is a fair value hedge, that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark interest rates, and that the strategy is to eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed rate interest payments to LIBOR. 
    
  The available-for-sale investment securities hedged consist of sovereign debt, U.S. Treasury bonds, agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and covered bonds that had original maturities of   30   years or less at initial purchase.  The swaps on all of these investment securities are not callable.  All of these securities are hedged with  pay fixed rate, receive variable rate  swaps of similar maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   $7.9 billion   face amount of securities were hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of   $8.0 billion  . 
    
  The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally have original maturities of   five   to   30   years.  We issue both callable and non-callable debt.  The non-callable debt is hedged with  receive fixed rate, pay variable rate  swaps with similar maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon.  Callable debt is hedged with callable swaps where the call dates of the swaps exactly match the call dates of the debt.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   $20.0 billion   par value of debt was hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of   $20.0 billion  . 
    
  In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges.  We use forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of   nine months   or less to hedge our British pound, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee and Singapore dollar foreign exchange exposure with respect to foreign currency forecasted revenue and expense transactions in entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.  As of   Sept. 30,  

2016  , the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions and designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges were   $434 million   (notional), with a pre-tax gain of   $5 million   recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  This gain will be reclassified to income or expense over the next   nine   months. 
    
  Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.  These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities of less than   two   years.  The derivatives employed are designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign investments due to exchange rates.  Changes in the value of the forward foreign exchange contracts offset the changes in value of the foreign investments due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  The change in fair market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts is deferred and reported within accumulated translation adjustments in shareholders  equity, net of tax.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  , forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling   $7.1 billion   were designated as hedges. 
    
  In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we also designate non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.  Those non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries were all long-term liabilities of BNY Mellon in various currencies, and, at   Sept. 30, 2016  , had a combined U.S. dollar equivalent value of   $432 million  .

Trading activities (including trading derivatives) 
    
  We manage trading risk through a system of position limits, a VaR methodology based on Monte Carlo simulations and other market sensitivity measures.  Risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a separate unit on a daily basis.  Based on certain assumptions, the VaR methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions.  The calculation assumes a   one  -day holding period for most instruments, utilizes a   99%   confidence level and incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options.  The VaR model is one of several statistical models used to develop economic capital results, which is allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted performance. 
    
  As the VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences, the risk assessment process includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio and management s assessment of market conditions.  Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market events are also performed.  Stress tests, by their design, incorporate  

the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of observed correlations.  The results of these stress tests are reviewed weekly with senior management. 
    
  Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading included the following: 

Foreign exchange includes income from purchasing and selling foreign currencies and currency forwards, futures and options.  Other trading revenue reflects results from futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, structured foreign currency swaps, options, equity derivatives and fixed income and equity securities.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral 
    
  We assess credit risk of our counterparties through regular examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information.  This and other information is used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to assess credit quality. 
    
  Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality of each counterparty.  Collateral is generally held or pledged in the form of cash or highly liquid government securities.  Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily. 
    
  Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivative instruments 
    
  Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements of The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking subsidiary and the subsidiary through     which BNY Mellon enters into the substantial majority of its OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements, contain provisions that may     require us to take certain actions if The Bank of New York Mellon s public debt rating fell to a certain level.  Early termination provisions, or  close-out      agreements, in those contracts could trigger immediate payment of outstanding contracts that are  

in net liability positions.  Certain collateral     agreements would require The Bank of New York Mellon to immediately post additional collateral to cover some or all of The Bank of New York Mellon s liabilities to a counterparty. 
    
  The following table shows the fair value of contracts falling under early termination provisions that were in net liability positions as of   Sept. 30, 2016   for three key ratings triggers: 
    
                       If The Bank of New York Mellon s rating was changed to (Moody s/S P)

(a) 
    The amounts represent potential total close-out values if The Bank of New York Mellon s rating were to immediately drop to the indicated levels. 

The aggregated fair value of contracts impacting potential trade close-out amounts and collateral obligations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in market conditions, changes in the composition of counterparty trades, new business or changes to the agreement definitions establishing close-out or collateral obligations. 
    
  Additionally, if The Bank of New York Mellon s debt rating had fallen below investment grade on   Sept. 30, 2016  , existing collateral arrangements would have required us to have posted an additional   $176 million   of collateral.

Secured borrowings 
    
  The following tables present the contract value of repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions accounted for as secured borrowings by the type of collateral provided to counterparties. 

BNY Mellon s repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated with liquidity.  We are required to pledge collateral based on predetermined terms within the agreements.  If we were to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral pledged for these transactions, additional collateral could be required to  

be provided to the counterparty; therefore, decreasing the amount of assets available for other liquidity needs that may arise.  BNY Mellon also offers tri-party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market where we are exposed to credit risk.  In order to mitigate this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Note 17 - Commitments and contingent liabilities 
    
  In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products, commercial lending commitments, letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications.  We assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks.  These items involve, to varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate risk not recognized in the balance sheet.  Our off-balance sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar to those used for on-balance sheet risks.  Significant industry concentrations related to credit exposure at   Sept. 30, 2016   are disclosed in the financial institutions portfolio exposure table and the commercial portfolio exposure table below.   

Major concentrations in securities lending are primarily to broker-dealers and are generally collateralized with cash.    Securities lending transactions are discussed below. 

The following table presents a summary of our off-balance sheet credit risks, net of participations. 

Also included in lending commitments are facilities that provide liquidity for variable rate tax-exempt securities wrapped by monoline insurers.  The credit approval for these facilities is based on an assessment of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers factors other than the financial strength of the monoline insurer. 
    
  The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value of any collateral. 
    
  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  A summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:   $31.1 billion   in less than one year,   $21.4 billion   in one to five years and   $260 million   over five years. 
    
  Standby letters of credit ( SBLC ) principally support corporate obligations and were collateralized with cash and securities of   $391 million   and   $299 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   Sept. 30, 2016  ,   $2.7 billion   of the SBLCs will expire within one year and   $1.7 billion   in one to five years. 
    
  We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.  The fair value of the liability, which was recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the present value of contractual customer fees. 

100   BNY Mellon 

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

The estimated liability for losses related to these commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-related commitments.  The allowance for lending-related commitments was   $126 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $118 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.  BNY Mellon s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire without being funded.  SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely for payment/performance risk.  The table below shows SBLCs by investment grade: 

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer.  Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying transaction.  As a result, the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  Commercial letters of credit totaled   $266 million   at   Sept. 30, 2016   compared with   $303 million   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon), to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a prearranged contract, which normally matures in less than   90   days.     
    
  We typically lend securities with indemnification against borrower default.  We generally require the borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value of   102%   of the fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk.  Market risk can also arise in securities lending transactions.  These risks are controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that can be undertaken.  Securities lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly rated counterparties.    Securities lending indemnifications  

were secured by collateral of     $323 billion   at   Sept. 30, 2016   and   $306 billion   at   Dec. 31, 2015  . 
    
  CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ), engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon, BNY Mellon, and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders against specific types of borrower default.  At     Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  ,   $62 billion   and   $54 billion  , respectively,   of borrowings at CIBC Mellon for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of     $66 billion   and   $56 billion  , respectively.    If, upon a default, a borrower s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors.    
    
  We expect many of these guarantees to expire without the need to advance any cash.  The revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the transaction, including collateral, if any. 
    
  Exposure for certain administrative errors 
    
  In connection with certain offshore tax-exempt funds that we manage, we may be liable to the funds for certain administrative errors.  The errors relate to the resident status of such funds, potentially exposing the Company to a tax liability related to the funds  earnings.  The Company is in discussions with tax authorities regarding the funds.  With the charge recorded in 2014 for this matter, we believe we are appropriately accrued and the additional reasonably possible exposure is not significant. 
    
  Indemnification arrangements 
    
  We have provided standard representations for underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other similar types of arrangements and customary indemnification for claims and legal proceedings     related to providing financial services that are not otherwise included above.  Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of these risks.  Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications and the contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification are not expected to occur.  Furthermore, often counterparties to these transactions provide us with comparable  

BNY Mellon   101    

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

indemnifications.  We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these indemnifications for several reasons.  In addition to the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of events that would trigger indemnification or the level of indemnification for a certain event.  We believe, however, that the possibility that we will have to make any material payments for these indemnifications is remote.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , we have not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements. 
    
  Clearing and settlement exchanges 
    
  We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or other transactions settle.  Certain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations.  We believe the likelihood that a clearing or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would become insolvent is remote.  Additionally, certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement losses to the members of the exchange.  It is not possible to quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.  In addition, any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss cannot be quantified.  At   Sept. 30, 2016   and   Dec. 31, 2015  , we have not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements. 
    
  Legal proceedings 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in or made parties to pending and potential legal actions.  We also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal).  Claims for significant monetary damages are often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in regulatory matters.  It is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these matters.  However, on the basis of our current knowledge and  

understanding, we do not believe that judgments, settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters (either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could have a material effect on net income in a given period. 
    
  In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in litigation and governmental and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and governmental and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss, fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with each such matter.  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, BNY Mellon establishes accruals for litigation and governmental and regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable.  In such cases, there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued.  BNY Mellon will continue to monitor such matters for developments that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate.  If the loss contingency in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable, BNY Mellon does not establish an accrual and the matter will continue to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable.  BNY Mellon believes that its accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated financial position of BNY Mellon, although future accruals could have a material effect on net income in a given period. 
    
  For certain of those matters described here for which a loss contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible (whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.    For those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of such reasonably possible loss is up to   $900 million   in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters.

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon: 
    
  Sentinel Matters 
  On Jan. 18, 2008, The Bank of New York Mellon filed a proof of claim in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding of Sentinel Management Group, Inc. ( Sentinel ) pending in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to recover approximately     $312 million     loaned to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by Sentinel at The Bank of New York Mellon.  On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary complaint against The Bank of New York Mellon seeking to disallow The Bank of New York Mellon s claim and seeking damages for The Bank of New York Mellon s allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in misappropriating customer assets and improperly using those assets as collateral for the loan.  In a decision dated Nov. 3, 2010, the court found for The Bank of New York Mellon and against the bankruptcy trustee, holding that The Bank of New York Mellon s loan to Sentinel was valid, fully secured and not subject to equitable subordination.  The bankruptcy trustee appealed this decision, and on Aug. 9, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a decision affirming the trial court s judgment.  On Sept. 7, 2012, the bankruptcy trustee filed a petition for rehearing and, on Nov. 30, 2012, the Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion and vacated its judgment.  On Aug. 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals reversed its own prior decision and the district court s decision, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.  On Dec. 10, 2014, the district court issued a decision in favor of The Bank of New York Mellon holding that the transfers from Sentinel cannot be reversed and that The Bank of New York Mellon s lien was valid and not subject to equitable subordination.  The bankruptcy trustee appealed the decision.  On Jan. 8, 2016, the Court of Appeals invalidated The Bank of New York Mellon s lien but rejected the trustee s request for equitable subordination.  On July 13, 2016, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement between The Bank of New York Mellon and the bankruptcy trustee, under which both parties will dismiss all litigation between them and The Bank of New York Mellon will be granted an unsecured claim for the amount of the loan.  We received distributions in August 2016 on a pro rata basis with other unsecured creditors.  

In November 2009, the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) indicated that it is considering a recommendation to the CFTC that it file a civil enforcement action against The Bank of New York Mellon for possible violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations in connection with its relationship to Sentinel.  The Bank of New York Mellon responded in writing to the CFTC on Jan. 29, 2010 and provided an explanation as to why an enforcement action is unwarranted. 
    
  Standing Instruction Matters 
  Beginning in December 2009, government authorities conducted inquiries seeking information relating primarily to standing instruction foreign exchange transactions in connection with custody services BNY Mellon provides to custody clients.  On various dates beginning in 2009, BNY Mellon was named as a defendant in lawsuits by various government and private entities alleging BNY Mellon s pricing of standing instruction foreign exchange transactions was improper. 
    
  On March 19, 2015, BNY Mellon announced that it had resolved substantially all of the pending standing instruction-related actions, resulting in a total of   $714 million   in settlement payments.  On May 21, 2015, BNY Mellon settled a putative class action lawsuit asserting securities law violations.  With these settlements, which are now all final, BNY Mellon has effectively resolved virtually all of the standing instruction FX-related actions, with the exception of several lawsuits brought by individual customers or shareholders asserting derivative claims.  
    
  Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings 
  The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the trustee has expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the MBS transactions.  These actions include a lawsuit brought in New York State court on June 18, 2014, and later re-filed in federal court, by a group of institutional investors who purport to sue on behalf of   253   MBS trusts.  
    
  Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford 
  In late December 2005, Pershing LLC became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. ( SGC ), a registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of  

BNY Mellon   103    

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford.  Stanford International Bank ( SIB ), also controlled by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit ( CDs ).  Some investors allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase CDs.  In 2009, the SEC charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into receivership.  Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed   15   lawsuits against Pershing that are pending in Texas, including   two   putative class actions.  The purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and assert contractual, statutory and common law claims.  In addition,   one   FINRA arbitration matter brought by alleged purchasers remains pending.  
    
  Brazilian Postalis Litigation 
  BNY Mellon Serviceos Financeiros DTVM S.A. ( DTVM ), a subsidiary that provides a number of asset services in Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in which the exclusive investor is a public pension fund for postal workers called Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e Tel grafos ( Postalis ).  On Aug. 22, 2014, Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses related to a Postalis investment fund for which DTVM serves as fund administrator.  Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to properly perform alleged duties, including duties to conduct due diligence of and exert control over the fund manager, Atl ntica Administra  o de Recursos ( Atl ntica ), and Atl ntica s investments.  On March 12, 2015, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and BNY Mellon Administra  o de Ativos Ltda. ( Ativos ) alleging failure to properly perform alleged duties relating to another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos is investment manager.  On Dec. 14, 2015, Associac o Dos Profissionais Dos Correiros, a Brazilian postal workers association, filed a lawsuit in S o Paulo against DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM improperly contributed to investment losses in the Postalis portfolio.  On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed   three   additional lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging failure to properly perform alleged duties and liabilities for losses with respect to investments in several other funds.  On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis filed another lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY Mellon Aloca  o de Patrim nio Ltda., an investment management subsidiary, alleging failure to properly perform duties and liability for losses with respect to investments in  

various other funds of which the defendants were administrator and/or manager.   
    
  Depositary Receipt Matters 
  Between late December 2015 and February 2016,   four   putative class action lawsuits were filed against BNY Mellon asserting claims relating to BNY Mellon s foreign exchange pricing when converting dividends and other distributions from non-U.S. companies in its role as depositary bank to Depositary Receipt issuers.  The primary claims are for breach of contract and violations of ERISA.  The lawsuits have been consolidated into   two   suits which are pending in federal court in the Southern District of New York and are all in their early stages. 
    
  Brazilian Silverado Litigation 
  DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento em Direitos Credit rios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum ( Silverado Maximum Fund ), which invests in commercial credit receivables.  On June 2, 2016, the Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco Alem o in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gest o e Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.  The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for which the defendants are jointly and severally liable. 

Note 18 - Lines of business 
    
  We have an internal information system that produces performance data along product and service lines for our   two   principal businesses and the Other segment.   
    
  Business accounting principles 
    
  Our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the generally accepted accounting principles used for consolidated financial reporting.  These measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance. 
    
  Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or when improvements are made in the measurement principles.  
    
  Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we revised the net interest revenue for our business to reflect  

104   BNY Mellon 

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

adjustments to our transfer pricing methodology to better reflect the value of certain deposits.  Also beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we refined the expense allocation process for indirect expenses to simplify the expenses recorded in the Other segment to include only expenses not directly attributable to the Investment Management and Investment Services  

operations.  These changes did not impact the consolidated results. 
    
  The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Annual Report. 

The primary types of revenue for our   two   principal businesses and the Other segment are presented below: 

Business 
    Primary types of revenue 
      Investment Management 
          Investment management and performance fees from: 
  Mutual funds 
  Institutional clients 
  Private clients 
  High net worth individuals and families, endowments and foundations and related entities 
        Distribution and servicing fees 
      Investment Services 
          Asset servicing fees, including institutional trust and custody fees, broker-dealer services, global collateral services and securities lending 
        Issuer services fees, including Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts 
        Clearing services fees, including broker-dealer services, registered investment advisor services and prime brokerage services 
        Treasury services fees, including global payment services and working capital solutions 
        Foreign exchange 
        Credit-related activities 
      Other segment 
          Leasing operations 
        Corporate treasury activities 
        Derivatives business 
        Global markets  
        Business exits 

The results of our businesses are presented and analyzed on an internal management reporting basis: 

Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue generated by each business.  Fee and other revenue transferred between businesses under revenue transfer agreements is included within other revenue in each business.   
                
    Revenues and expenses associated with specific client bases are included in those businesses.  For example, foreign exchange activity associated with clients using custody products is included in Investment Services.   
                
    Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each business.  We employ a funds transfer pricing system that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities of each business based on their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics.   
                
    The provision for credit losses associated with the respective credit portfolios is reflected in each business segment. 

Incentive expense related to restricted stock is allocated to the businesses.   
                
    Support and other indirect expenses are allocated to businesses based on internally developed methodologies. 
                
    Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses based on average deposits generated within each business.   
                
    Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business in which the charge occurs.   
                
    Management of the investment securities portfolio is a shared service contained in the Other segment.  As a result, gains and losses associated with the valuation of the securities portfolio are included in the Other segment.   
                
    Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our investment securities portfolio.  We typically allocate all interest revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.  Accordingly, accretion related to the portion of the investment securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been included in the results of the businesses.   
                
    M I expense is a corporate level item and is recorded in the Other segment. 

BNY Mellon   105    

                 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (continued) 

Restructuring charges relate to corporate-level initiatives and were therefore recorded in the Other segment.  
                
    Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related income or expense are specifically  

assigned to each business.  Businesses with a net liability position have been allocated assets.   
             
    Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within individual businesses.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by BNY Mellon is accumulated and communicated to BNY Mellon s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.  In addition, our ethics hotline can also be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we may routinely modify, upgrade or enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.  There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the   third quarter of 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Forward-looking Statements 

Some statements in this document are forward-looking.  These include all statements about the usefulness of Non-GAAP measures, the future results of BNY Mellon, our businesses, financial, liquidity and capital condition, results of operations, goals, strategies, outlook, objectives, expectations (including those regarding our performance results, regulatory, market, economic or accounting developments, legal proceedings and other contingencies), effective tax rate, estimates (including those regarding capital ratios and the impact of issuing additional debt in connection with our resolution strategy), intentions (including those regarding our resolution strategy), targets, opportunities and initiatives.  
    
  In this report, any other report, any press release or any written or oral statement that BNY Mellon or its executives may make, words, such as  estimate,   forecast,   project,   anticipate,   target,   expect,   intend,   continue,   seek,   believe,   plan,   goal,   could,   should,   would,   may,   will,   strategy,   synergies,   opportunities,   trends  and words of similar meaning, may signify forward-looking statements. 
    
  Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed in the  Risk Factors  section of our 2015 Annual Report and this Form 10-Q, such as: an information security event or technology disruption that results in a loss of confidential information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients and any material adverse effect on our business and results of operations; failure of our technology or that of a third party or vendor, or if we neglect to update our technology, develop and market new technology to meet clients  needs or protect our intellectual property and any material adverse effect on our business; extensive government regulation and supervision and the impact of the significant amount of rulemaking since the 2008 financial crisis, which have, and in the future may, compel us to change how we manage our businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and have increased our compliance and operational risks and costs; failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including  well capitalized  and  well managed  status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and any resulting limitations on our activities, or adverse effects on our business and financial condition; our preferred resolution strategy  

and any adverse effects on our liquidity, financial condition and security holders; regulatory actions or litigation and any adverse effect on our results of operations or harm to our businesses or reputation; adverse publicity, government scrutiny or other reputational harm and any negative effect on our businesses; the risks relating to new lines of business, new products and services or strategic project initiatives and the failure to implement these initiatives, which could affect our results of operations; the risks and uncertainties relating to our strategic transactions and any adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; operational risk and any material adverse effect on our business; failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures and any material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition; competition in all aspects of our business and any negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability; failure of our risk management framework to be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses; change or uncertainty in monetary, tax and other governmental policies and the impact on our businesses, profitability and ability to compete; political, economic, legal, operational and other risks inherent in operating globally and any material adverse effect on our business; failure to attract and retain employees and any adverse effect on our business; acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts and any negative impact on our business and operations; weakness in financial markets and the economy generally and any material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition; market volatility and any adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to manage risk; ongoing concerns about the financial stability of certain countries, the failure or instability of any of our significant global counterparties, or a breakup of the European Union or Eurozone and any material adverse effect on our business and results of operations; the UK referendum and any negative effects on global economic conditions, global financial markets, and our business and results of operations; continuing low or volatile interest rates and any material adverse effect on our profitability; write-downs of securities that we own and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions and any reduction in our earnings or impact on our financial condition; our dependence on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and the potential adverse effects of a slowing

in market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance and/or negative trends in savings rates or in investment preferences; any adverse effect on our foreign exchange revenues from decreased market volatility or cross-border investment activity of our clients; the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties, and our assumption of credit and counterparty risk, which could expose us to loss and adversely affect our business; credit, regulatory and reputational risks as a result of our tri-party repo collateral agency services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations; any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries, which could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and on the value of the securities we issue; any adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations of not effectively managing our liquidity; inadequate reserves for credit losses, including loan reserves, and any resulting charges through provision expense; tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions and any adverse effect on our net income, effective tax rate and overall results of operations and financial condition; changes in accounting standards and any material impact on our reported financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and other financial

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
    
  The information required by this Item is set forth in the  Legal proceedings  section in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which portion is incorporated herein by reference in response to this item. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    
  The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 95 through 121 of our 2015 Annual Report.  The discussion of Risk Factors, as so supplemented, sets forth our most significant risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  However, other factors, besides those discussed below or in our 2015 Annual Report or other of our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also could adversely affect our business or results.  We cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report and such other reports address all potential risks that we may face.  These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Form 10-Q.  See Forward-looking Statements.  
    
  The application of our preferred resolution strategy could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our security holders.    
    
  Following the receipt of feedback from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in April 2016 on our 2015 resolution plan, we determined that, in the event of our material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act would be a single point of entry strategy.  Under this strategy, before commencing proceedings in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court, we would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries with the goal of enabling these subsidiaries to continue operating.  Following the recapitalizations and provision of liquidity, we would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.    
    
  In connection with the development of the single point of entry strategy, we intend to enter into a support agreement with certain of our major subsidiaries to facilitate the recapitalizations and  

provision of liquidity.  The support agreement is expected to require us to pledge a significant amount of our assets to support our obligations to recapitalize and provide liquidity to our major subsidiaries.  We expect to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations during business-as-usual circumstances.  The terms of the support agreement have not been finalized and may change, possibly materially, from our current expectations.    
    
  Consistent with the Federal Reserve s proposal regarding total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and the FDIC s single point of entry strategy under Title II s Orderly Liquidation Authority, our single point of entry strategy and associated support agreement is being developed so that our shareholders and unsecured creditors bear any losses resulting from our bankruptcy.  Consequently, if we were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding and our single point of entry strategy is successful, creditors of some or all of our major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while our security holders could face significant losses, potentially including the loss of their entire investment.  If this strategy is implemented and is not successful, our security holders may be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented (and the recapitalizations and provision of liquidity had not occurred) because assets provided to our major subsidiaries would not be available to pay the holders of our securities.    
    
  The result of the United Kingdom s referendum on whether to remain part of the European Union has had and may continue to have negative effects on global economic conditions, global financial markets, and our business and results of operations.     
    
  On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether the UK should remain part of the EU, the outcome of which was a vote in favor of withdrawing from the EU.  The result of the referendum has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the UK and may create such environments in other EU member states.  Political and economic uncertainty has in the past led to, and the outcome of the referendum and the withdrawal of the UK from the EU could lead to, declines in market liquidity and activity levels, volatile market conditions, a contraction of available credit, lower or negative interest rates, weaker economic growth and reduced business confidence.  Market disruptions, as well as adverse market and economic conditions, could, among other things, have a negative effect on  

BNY Mellon   111    

                 Part II - Other Information   (continued) 

our fee revenues and lead to a  flight to safety,  which could result in increases in our client deposits and assets, altering the size and composition of our balance sheet and adversely affecting our leverage-based regulatory capital ratios.     
    
  The result of the referendum means that the long-term nature of the UK s relationship with the EU is unclear (including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which EU laws to replicate or replace), and there is considerable uncertainty as to when the framework for any such relationship governing both the access of the UK to European markets and the access of EU Member States to the UK s markets will be determined and implemented.  As a result of the referendum, we, including our EU affiliates, may face additional operational, regulatory and compliance costs.  In addition, the regulatory, tax and supervisory regimes applicable to our UK operations and those of its EU affiliates and their dealings with other EU member states are expected to change; however, the nature and timing of such changes are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  Certain of our EU operations are conducted through a UK branch of The Bank of New York Mellon and subsidiaries located in the UK and other EU member states.  If our UK subsidiaries are not able to retain their EU financial services  

passport,  which permits cross-border services and activities throughout the single EU market without needing to obtain local authorizations, we may incur costs to move operations and, potentially, personnel from our UK branch and subsidiaries to our subsidiaries based in other EU member states.  The outcome of the referendum has also created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the UK and the transfer of data to and from the UK.     
    
  Following the referendum, volatility in the exchange rate for the British pound has increased.  The decrease in the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar since the referendum has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our Investment Management business, which typically has more non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues than expenses.  Volatility in exchange rates may also have a negative effect on our Investment Services business, which typically has more non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses than revenues.     
    
  The effects of the result of the referendum, including those described above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
           (c) 
    The following table discloses repurchases of our common stock made in the   third quarter of 2016  .  All of the Company s preferred stock outstanding has preference over the Company s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. 
       
  Issuer purchases of equity securities 

(a) 
    Includes   36 thousand   shares repurchased at a purchase price of   $1 million   from employees, primarily in connection with the employees  payment of taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock.  The average price per share of open market purchases was   $40.18  . 
              (b) 
    Represents the maximum value of the shares authorized to be repurchased through the second quarter of 2017, including employee benefit plan repurchases, in connection with the Federal Reserve s non-objection to our 2016 capital plan. 

On June 29, 2016, in connection with the Federal Reserve s non-objection to our 2016 capital plan, BNY Mellon announced a stock purchase program providing for the repurchase of an aggregate of   $2.14 billion   of common stock and the repurchase of up to an additional $560 million of common stock contingent upon the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock.  The 2016 capital plan began in the third quarter of 2016 and continues through the second quarter of 2017.   
    
  In conjunction with the Federal Reserve s non-objection to BNY Mellon s 2016 capital plan, in August 2016, we issued $1 billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, $750 million of which satisfied the contingency for the repurchase of up to $560 million of common stock in 2016.  In the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased   $464 million   of common stock. 
    
  Share repurchases may be executed through repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and through derivative, accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions.

 THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN (AS AMENDED)

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 
    
  THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN   (AS AMENDED BY HRCC ON AUGUST 8, 2016) 
    
  1.  Purpose  .  The purpose of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Executive Severance Plan (the    Plan   ) is to retain certain senior executives of the Corporation by reason of providing appropriate severance benefits and to ensure their continued dedication to their duties in connection with certain types of termination of employment after a Change in Control (as defined in Section 2(e) below). 
  2.        Definitions  .  As used in this Plan, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below: 
  (a)           Annual Incentive Award    means the annual incentive awarded to a Participant by the Corporation from time to time, including any cash and non-cash portions of such incentive, whether payable currently or on a deferred basis;   provided  ,   however  , that any long-term component of an annual incentive award (other than time-vested restricted stock or restricted stock units) shall not be deemed to be annual incentives for purposes of this definition.  
  (b)         Base Salary    means the Participant s annual rate of base salary for the year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs (or, if greater, for the year before the year of termination). 
  (c)           Board    means the Board of Directors of the Corporation and, after a Change in Control, the  board of directors  of the Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, as defined for purposes of Section 2(e). 
  (d)         Cause    means any of the following with respect to a Participant: 
  (i)        The Participant s continued failure, in a material way, to perform his or her responsibilities to the Corporation or a Subsidiary,   after   demand for substantial performance has been given by the Board, any officer of the Corporation to whom the Participant reports or any higher level officer that specifically identifies how the Participant has not substantially performed his or her responsibilities;   provided  ,   however  , that following a Change in Control, in order to terminate a Participant s employment under this Section 2(d)(i), such failure must be determined to be willful.  A Participant s failure to perform under this Section 2(d)(i) does not, however, include failure resulting from the Participant s incapacity due to mental or physical illness or injury or from any permitted leave required by law or any failure after the Participant gives notice of termination for Good Reason or the Corporation gives notice of termination other than for Cause or Disability. 
  (ii)        The Participant s violation of the Code of Conduct and Interpretative Guidance of the Corporation or any rule or regulation governing the conduct of the Corporation s business or the Participant s employment with the Corporation. 
  (iii)        The Participant s conviction of, or plea of guilty or   nolo contendere   to, a crime (other than a minor traffic offense). 
  (iv)        The Participant being subject to the prohibitions of Section 19(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any similar statute, rule or regulation. 
  (v)        The Participant s fraud or material dishonesty in connection with the business of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to, the Participant taking actions or failing to take actions in a manner intending to result in personal gain at the expense of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(vi)        The Participant s breach of his or her fiduciary duties to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  For this definition, no act or omission by a Participant will be  willful  unless it is made by the Participant in bad faith or without a reasonable belief that such act or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and any act or omission by a Participant based on authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or the HRCC, on the advice of counsel for the Corporation or on the instruction of any officer of the Corporation to whom the Participant reports or any higher level officer will be deemed made in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation. 
  (e)           Change in Control    means the occurrence of any one of the following events: 
  (i)        During any period of not more than two (2) years, the Incumbent Directors no longer represent a majority of the Board.     Incumbent Directors    are (A) the members of the Board as of July 1, 2007 and (B) any individual who becomes a director subsequent to the date hereof whose appointment or nomination was approved by at least a majority of the Incumbent Directors then on the Board (either by specific vote or by approval, without prior written notice to the Board objecting to the nomination, of a proxy statement in which the member was named as nominee).  However, the Incumbent Directors will not include anyone who becomes a member of the Board after the date hereof as a result of an actual or threatened election contest or proxy or consent solicitation on behalf of anyone other than the Board, including as a result of any appointment, nomination or other agreement intended to avoid or settle a contest or solicitation; 
  (ii)        There is a beneficial owner of securities entitled to 30% or more of the total voting power of the Corporation s then-outstanding securities in respect of the election of the Board (the    Voting Securities   ), other than (A) the Corporation, any Subsidiary of it or any employee benefit plan or related trust sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of it; (B) any underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of them; (C) anyone who becomes a beneficial owner of that percentage of Voting Securities as a result of an Excluded Transaction (as defined in Section 2(e)(iii)); or (D) anyone who becomes a beneficial owner of that percentage of Voting Securities as a result of a transaction in which Voting Securities are acquired from the Corporation, if the transaction is approved by a majority of the Incumbent Directors in a resolution that expressly states that the transaction is not a Change in Control under this Section 2(e); or 
  (iii)        Consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar transaction (including an exchange offer combined with a merger or consolidation) involving the Corporation (a    Reorganization   ) or a sale, lease or other disposition (including by way of a series of transactions or by way of merger, consolidation, stock sale or similar transaction involving one or more subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the Corporation s consolidated assets (a    Sale   ) other than an Excluded Transaction.  A Reorganization or Sale is an    Excluded Transaction    if immediately following it: (A) 50% or more of the total voting power of the Surviving Corporation s then-outstanding securities in respect of the election of directors (or similar officials in the case of a non-corporation) is represented by Voting Securities outstanding immediately before the Reorganization or Sale or by securities into which such Voting Securities were converted in the Reorganization or Sale; (B) there is no beneficial owner of securities entitled to 30% or more of the total voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the Surviving Corporation in respect of the election of directors (or similar officials in the case of a non-corporation); and (C) a majority of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation (or similar officials in the case of a non-corporation) were Incumbent Directors at the time the Board approved the execution of the initial agreement providing for the Reorganization or Sale.  The    Surviving Corporation    means in a Reorganization, the entity resulting from the Reorganization or in a Sale, the entity that has acquired all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, except that, if there is a beneficial owner of securities entitled to 95% of the total voting power (in respect of the election of directors or similar officials in the case of a non-corporation) of the then-outstanding securities of the entity that would otherwise be the Surviving Corporation, then that beneficial owner will be the Surviving Corporation.  (Any Reorganization or Sale which does not satisfy all of the criteria specified in (A), (B) and (C) shall be deemed a    Qualifying Transaction   ). 
  (iv)        the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation. 
  
   -2- 

(f)           CIC Termination Period    means the period of time beginning with a Change in Control and ending two (2) years following such Change in Control. 
  (g)           Code    means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
  (h)           Corporation    means The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. 
  (i)           Date of Termination    means (i) the effective date on which the Participant s employment by the Corporation terminates as specified in a prior written notice by the Corporation or the Participant, as the case may be, to the other, delivered pursuant to Section 8 or (ii) if the Participant s employment by the Corporation terminates by reason of death, the date of death of the Participant. 
  (j)           Disability    shall mean long-term disability under the terms of the Corporation s long-term disability plan, as then in effect. 
  (k)           Good Reason    means the occurrence, following a Change in Control, of one or more of the following circumstances, without the Participant s prior written consent, and which circumstance(s) are not cured by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice from the Participant describing the circumstances that constitute Good Reason: 
  (i)        any material and adverse change in the Participant s duties or responsibilities with the Corporation, except as required by law, rule or regulation; 
  (ii)        any (1) reduction in the Participant s rate of annual base salary, or (2) material reduction in the Participant s overall aggregate annual compensation opportunities (including base salary, annual and long-term target incentive compensation opportunities).  With respect to clause (2) above, the Participant acknowledges that a reduction in annual or long-term target incentive compensation opportunities does not constitute Good Reason hereunder so long as the reduction has resulted merely from a pay mix change determined in accordance with applicable opportunity guidelines or consensus market data or law, rule or regulation; 
  (iii)        any requirement that the Participant be based at an office located outside of the country in which the Participant s office is located immediately prior to the Change in Control; 
  (iv)        any other action or inaction by the Corporation (or a Successor) that constitutes a material breach of this Plan (including but not limited to the Corporation s failure to obtain from any Surviving Corporation the assent to this Agreement contemplated by Section 7 hereof). 
  If the Participant does not provide written notice to the Corporation within forty-five (45) days after the initial existence of an event constituting Good Reason has occurred and terminate employment within ten (10) business days following the end of the thirty (30) day cure period (if the event constituting Good Reason has not been cured during that period), that event will no longer constitute Good Reason.  For purposes of clause (i) of Section 2(k)(ii) above, an immaterial or inadvertent reduction in a Participant s rate of annual base salary that is not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Corporation promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Participant shall not constitute Good Reason.  The Participant s right to terminate employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the Participant s incapacity due to mental or physical illness and the Participant s continued employment through the above-mentioned forty-five (45) day notice or thirty (30) day cure periods shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any other event or condition constituting Good Reason. 
  (l)           HRCC    means the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board. 
  (m)           Investigation    means an investigation authorized by the Board, a self-regulatory organization empowered with self-regulatory responsibilities under federal or state laws or a governmental department or agency. 
  (n)           Participant    means each of the senior executives of the Corporation, who is selected by the HRCC in its sole discretion for coverage by this Plan.

(o)           Pro-rata Annual Incentive Award    means (i) an Annual Incentive Award for the Corporation s fiscal year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs pursuant to the Participant s annual incentive scorecard or other applicable metric as recommended by management and as determined by the HRCC after initially considering whether the Participant was actively employed for a sufficient portion of the year to warrant an Annual Incentive Award and the following factors, as applicable: (A) actual full year performance results for any corporate and business unit performance goals set forth in the Participant s Annual Incentive Award scorecard for the year of termination, (B) the Participant s individual modifier as set forth in such scorecard, determined as of the end of such fiscal year, provided that the individual modifier shall not exceed 100%, (C) any risk assessment adjustment based on the HRCC s assessment of any risk factors set forth in such scorecard, and (D) any other performance goals, adjustments and assessments as set forth in the scorecard and any applicable Annual Incentive Award plan,   multiplied by   (ii) a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of days the Participant was employed by the Corporation during the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurred and the denominator of which is 365. 
  (p)           Qualifying Termination    means a termination of the Participant s employment with the Corporation (i) by the Corporation other than for Cause or (ii) by the Participant for Good Reason after a Change in Control.  Termination of the Participant s employment on account of death, Disability, by the Corporation for Cause or by the Participant other than for Good Reason shall not be treated as a Qualifying Termination.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the death of the Participant after notice of termination for Good Reason or without Cause has been validly provided shall be deemed to be a Qualifying Termination. 
  (q)           Section 409A    means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder. 
  (r)           Subsidiary    means any corporation or other entity in which the Corporation has a direct or indirect ownership interest of 50% or more of the total combined voting power of the then outstanding securities or interests of such corporation or other entity entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or members of any similar governing body) or in which the Corporation has the right to receive 50% or more of the distribution of profits or 50% of the assets or liquidation or dissolution. 
  (s)           Target Annual Incentive Award    means a Participant s target Annual Incentive Award for the year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs (or, if greater, for the year before the year of termination);   provided  ,   however  , that in the event no target Annual Incentive Award has been established for the Participant for either the year of termination or the year before the year of termination,  Target Annual Incentive Award  shall mean the average Annual Incentive Award paid to the Participant for the three most recent years before the year of termination. 
  3.        Payments Upon Termination of Employment  . 
  (a)        Non-Change in Control Qualifying Termination  .  If during a period of time which is not a CIC Termination Period under the Plan, the employment of the Participant is terminated by the Corporation other than for Cause, then, subject to the Participant s execution of a Separation Agreement and Release substantially in the form attached to this Plan as Exhibit A (the    Separation Agreement and Release     )  , which shall be provided to the Participant no later than five (5) days after the Date of Termination and must be executed by the Participant, become effective and not be revoked by the Participant by the sixtieth (60   th   ) day following the Date of Termination, the Corporation shall provide to the Participant: 
  (i)        a cash payment equal to the Participant s Base Salary; and 
  (ii)        a Pro-rata Annual Incentive Award (including cash and non-cash portions thereof, as applicable) for the Corporation s fiscal year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs; any such cash and non-cash portions of the Pro-rata Annual Incentive Award shall be paid or awarded and shall become payable, in each case, at the same time(s) as annual incentives for the fiscal year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs are paid or awarded and become payable to other similarly situated executives of the Corporation;     provided, however, that the HRCC may determine the form(s) of such Pro-rata Annual Incentive in its discretion, and provided, further, that any portion of such Pro-rata Annual Incentive Award that is intended to be exempt from Section 409A as a  short-term deferral  (within the meaning of Section 409A) shall be paid no later than March 15   th    of the year following the year during which the Date of Termination occurred; and 
  
   -4- 

(iii)        for one year after Participant s Date of Termination, Participant, his or her spouse and his or her dependents will continue to be entitled to participate in the Corporation s group health plans in which the Participant participates immediately prior to his or her Date of Termination at the same rate as paid by similarly situated employees from time to time,   provided   that the Participant timely elects continuation coverage under Section 4980B(f) of the Code; and   provided  ,   further  , that to the extent that such health plan does not permit continuation of the Participant s or his or her spouse s or dependents  participation throughout such period, the Corporation shall provide the Participant, on the first business day of each calendar quarter, in advance, with an amount which is equal to the Company s cost of providing such benefits, less the applicable employee rate of participation; and 
  (iv)        for a period of one (1) year following the Participant s Date of Termination, the Corporation shall make certain executive-level outplacement services available to the Participant, as provided by the outplacement providers with whom the Corporation has a relationship at the time of Participant s Date of Termination; and 
  The cash payment specified in paragraph (i) of this Section 3(a) shall be paid in equal installments in accordance with the Corporation s regular payroll practice over the twelve (12) month period following the Participant s Date of Termination, with such payments commencing on the Corporation payroll date immediately following the sixty-fifth (65th) day following the Date of Termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a majority of the Incumbent Directors approves the resolution described in Section 2(e)(ii)(D) above that expressly states that a transaction is not a Change in Control under Section 2(e), but such transaction qualifies as a  change in control event  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i), then the payment due under paragraph (i) of this Section 3(a), to the extent it shall become payable, shall be paid in a lump sum and shall be paid at the time set forth in the first sentence of the flush paragraph of Section 3(b) below. 
  (b)        Post-Change in Control Qualifying Termination  .  If, during the CIC Termination Period, the employment of the Participant is terminated pursuant to a Qualifying Termination, then, subject to the Participant s execution of a Separation Agreement and Release substantially in the form attached to this Plan as Exhibit A, which shall be provided to the Participant no later than five (5) days after the Date of Termination and must be executed by the Participant, become effective and not be revoked by the Participant by the sixtieth (60   th   ) day following the Date of Termination, the Corporation shall provide to the Participant: 
  (i)        a lump sum cash payment equal to the result of multiplying (A) the sum of (x) the Participant s Base Salary, plus (y) the Participant s Target Annual Incentive Award by (B) 2.00; and 
  (ii)        a cash payment equal to the Participant s Target Annual Incentive Award for the fiscal year in which the Participant s Date of Termination occurs, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of days the Participant was employed by the Corporation during the fiscal year in which the Date of Termination occurred and the denominator of which is 365; and 
  (iii)        for two (2) years after Participant s Date of Termination, Participant, his or her spouse and his or her dependents will continue to be entitled to participate in the Corporation s group health plans in which the Participant participates immediately prior to his or her Date of Termination at the same rate as paid by similarly situated employees from time to time,   provided   that the Participant timely elects continuation coverage under Section 4980B(f) of the Code; and   provided  ,   further  , that to the extent that such health plan does not permit continuation of the Participant s or his or her spouse s or dependents  participation throughout such period, the Corporation shall provide the Participant, on the first business day of each calendar quarter, in advance, with an amount which is equal to the Company s cost of providing such benefits, less the applicable employee rate of participation; and 
  (iv)        for a period of one (1) year following the Participant s Date of Termination, the Corporation shall make certain executive-level outplacement services available to the Participant, as provided by the outplacement providers with whom the Corporation has a relationship at the time of Participant s Date of Termination. 
  
   -5- 

The cash payments specified in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 3(b) shall be paid on the sixty-fifth (65   th   ) day (or the next following business day if the sixty-fifth (65th) day is not a business day) following the Date of Termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Change in Control does not qualify as a  change in control event  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i), then the payments due under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 3(b) shall be paid at the time and in the form as set forth in the flush paragraph of Section 3(a) above. 
  (c)        Except as otherwise expressly provided pursuant to this Plan, this Plan shall be construed and administered in a manner which avoids duplication of compensation and benefits which may be provided under any other plan, program, policy, or other arrangement or individual contract or under any statute, rule or regulation.  In the event a Participant is covered by any other plan, program, policy, individually negotiated agreement or other arrangement, in effect as of his or her Date of Termination, that may duplicate the payments and benefits provided for in this Section 3, the HRCC is specifically empowered to reduce or eliminate the duplicative benefits provided for under the Plan. 
  4.        Withholding Taxes  .  The Corporation shall withhold from all payments due to the Participant (or his beneficiary or estate) hereunder all taxes which, by applicable federal, state, local or other law, the Corporation is required to withhold therefrom. 
  5.      Expenses  .  If any contest or dispute shall arise under this Plan involving termination of a Participant s employment with the Corporation or involving the failure or refusal of the Corporation to perform fully in accordance with the terms hereof, each party shall be responsible for its own legal fees and related expenses, if any, incurred in connection with such contest or dispute;   provided  ,   however  , that, with respect to any contest or dispute arising after a Change in Control, in the event the Participant substantially prevails with respect to such contest or dispute, the Corporation shall reimburse the Participant on a current basis for all reasonable legal fees and related expenses incurred by the Participant in connection with such contest or dispute, which reimbursement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date the Corporation receives the Participant s statement for such fees and expenses. 
  6.        Scope of Plan  .  Nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to entitle the Participant to continued employment with the Corporation or its Subsidiaries. 
  7.        Successors; Binding Agreement  . 
  (a)        This Plan shall not be terminated by any Reorganization or Sale.  In the event of any Reorganization or Sale, the provisions of this Plan shall be binding upon the Surviving Corporation, and such Surviving Corporation shall be treated as the Corporation hereunder. 
  (b)        The Corporation agrees that in connection with any Reorganization or Sale it will cause any successor entity to the Corporation unconditionally to assume all of the obligations of the Corporation hereunder.  Failure of the Corporation to obtain such assumption prior to the effectiveness of any such Reorganization or Sale that constitutes a Change in Control, shall be a breach of this Plan and shall constitute Good Reason hereunder and shall entitle the Participant to compensation and other benefits from the Corporation in the same amount and on the same terms as the Participant would be entitled hereunder if the Participant s employment were terminated following a Change in Control by reason of a Qualifying Termination.  For purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such Reorganization or Sale becomes effective shall be deemed the date Good Reason occurs, and shall be the Date of Termination if requested by a Participant. 
  (c)        The benefits provided under this Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If the Participant shall die while any amounts would be payable to the Participant hereunder had the Participant continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to such person or persons appointed in writing by the Participant to receive such amounts or, if no person is so appointed, to the Participant s estate. 
  8.        Notice  .    (a)   For purposes of this Plan, all notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, certified and return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed as follows: 
  
   -6- 

If to the Participant: the address listed as the Participant s address in the Corporation s personnel files. 
  If to the Corporation: 
  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation  Attention:  General Counsel       225 Liberty Street  New York, NY, 10286 
  or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. 
  (b)        A written notice of the Participant s Date of Termination by the Corporation or the Participant, as the case may be, to the other, shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Plan relied upon.  The failure by the Participant or the Corporation to set forth in such notice any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Participant or the Corporation hereunder or preclude the Participant or the Corporation from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Participant s or the Corporation s rights hereunder. 
  9.        Full Settlement; Resolution of Disputes and Costs  . 
  (a)        In no event shall the Participant be obligated to seek other employment or take other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan and, except as provided in the Separation Agreement and Release, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Participant obtains other employment. 
  (b)        Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Plan shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in New York by three arbitrators in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (   AAA   ) then in effect.  One arbitrator shall be selected by the Corporation, the other by the Participant and the third jointly by these arbitrators (or if they are unable to agree within thirty (30) days of the commencement of arbitration, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the AAA).  Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators  award in any court having jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, any arbitration panel that adjudicates any dispute, controversy or claim arising between a Participant and the Corporation, or any of their delegates or successors, in respect of a Participant s Qualifying Termination that occurs after a Change in Control, will apply a   de     novo   standard of review to any determinations made by such person.  Such   de     novo   standard shall apply notwithstanding the grant of full discretion hereunder to any such person or characterization of any such decision by such person as final, binding or conclusive on any party. 
  10.        Employment with Subsidiaries  .  Employment with the Corporation for purposes of this Plan shall include employment with any Subsidiary. 
  11.        Survival  .  The respective obligations and benefits afforded to the Corporation and the Participant as provided in Section 3 (to the extent that payments or benefits are owed as a result of a termination of employment that occurs during the term of this Plan), 4, 5, 7(c) and 9 shall survive the termination of this Plan. 
  12.        GOVERNING LAW; VALIDITY  .  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THIS PLAN IS SUBJECT TO ERISA, THE INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS PLAN SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS, AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS.  THE INVALIDITY OR UNENFORCEABILITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS PLAN SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS PLAN, WHICH OTHER PROVISIONS SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. 
  13.        Amendment and Termination  .  The HRCC may amend or terminate the Plan at any time without the consent of the Participants;   provided  ,   however  , that during a period commencing on a Change of Control and ending on  
  
   -7- 

the second anniversary of the Change of Control, Participants must be given at least twelve (12) months  notice of amendments that are adverse to the interests of the Participants (except that termination of a Participant s participation in the Plan may be made with three (3) months  notice) or planned termination of the Plan and   provided  ,   further  , that any termination or amendments to the Plan that are adverse to the interests of any Participant and made in anticipation of a Change of Control shall give a Participant the right to enforce his or her rights pursuant to Section 15.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period commencing on a Change in Control and ending on the second anniversary of the Change in Control, the Plan may not be amended or terminated by the HRCC (or any successor committee thereto), any Participant s participation hereunder may not be terminated, and the Policy (as defined below) may not be amended by the Board, in each case, in any manner which is materially adverse to the interests of any Participant without the prior written consent of such Participant.  
  14.        Interpretation and Administration  .  The Plan shall be administered by the HRCC (or any successor committee).  The HRCC (or any successor committee)  shall have the authority (i) to exercise all of the powers granted to it under the Plan, (ii) to construe, interpret and implement the Plan, (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, (iv) to make all determinations necessary or advisable in administration of the Plan, (v) to correct any defect, supply any omission and reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, and (vi) to delegate its responsibilities and authority hereunder to a subcommittee of the HRCC.  Actions of the Board or the HRCC (or any successor committee) shall be taken by a majority vote of its members. 
  15.        Claims and Appeals  .  Participants may submit claims for benefits by giving notice to the Corporation pursuant to Section 8 of this Plan.  If a Participant believes that he or she has not received coverage or benefits to which he or she is entitled under the Plan, the Participant may notify the HRCC in writing of a claim for coverage or benefits.  If the claim for coverage or benefits is denied in whole or in part, the HRCC shall notify the applicant in writing of such denial within thirty (30) days (which may be extended to sixty (60) days under special circumstances), with such notice setting forth: (i) the specific reasons for the denial; (ii) the Plan provisions upon which the denial is based; (iii) any additional material or information necessary for the applicant to perfect his or her claim; and (iv) the procedures for requesting a review of the denial.  Upon a denial of a claim by the HRCC, the Participant may: (i) request a review of the denial by the HRCC or, where review authority has been so delegated, by such other person or entity as may be designated by the HRCC for this purpose; (ii) review any Plan documents relevant to his or her claim; and (iii) submit issues and comments to the HRCC or its delegate that are relevant to the review.  Any request for review must be made in writing and received by the HRCC or its delegate within sixty (60) days of the date the applicant received notice of the initial denial, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing.  The HRCC or its delegate will make a written ruling on the applicant s request for review setting forth the reasons for the decision and the Plan provisions upon which the denial, if appropriate, is based.  This written ruling shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date the HRCC or its delegate receives the applicant s request for review unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision will be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the request for review.  All extensions of time permitted by this Section 15 will be permitted at the sole discretion of the HRCC or its delegate.  If the HRCC does not provide the Participant with written notice of the denial of his or her appeal, the Participant s claim shall be deemed denied. 
  16.        Type of Plan  .  This Plan is intended to be, and shall be interpreted as an unfunded employee welfare plan under Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (   ERISA   ) and Section 2520.104-24 of the Department of Labor Regulations, maintained primarily for the purpose of providing employee welfare benefits, to the extent that it provides welfare benefits, and under Sections 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA, as a plan that is unfunded and maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation, to the extent that it provides such compensation, in each case for a select group of management or highly compensated employees (i.e., a  top hat  plan). 
  17.        Nonassignability  .  Benefits under the Plan may not be assigned by the Participant.  The terms and conditions of the Plan shall be binding on the successors and assigns of the Corporation. 
  18.        Section 409A  . 
  (a)        To the extent a Participant would otherwise be entitled to any payment or benefit that under this Plan, or any plan or arrangement of the Corporation or its affiliates, constitutes  deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A and that if paid or provided during the six (6) months beginning on the date of termination of a Participant s employment  
  
   -8- 

would be subject to the Section 409A additional tax because the Participant is a  specified employee  (within the meaning of Section 409A and as determined by the Corporation) the payment or benefit will be paid or provided (or will commence being paid or provided, as applicable) to the Participant on the earlier of the six (6) month anniversary of the Participant s date of termination or the Participant s death.  In addition, any payment or benefit due upon a termination of the Participant s employment that represents a  deferral of compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A shall be paid or provided to the Participant only upon a  separation from service  as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h).  Each severance payment made under this Plan shall be deemed to be separate payments, and amounts payable under Section 3 of this Plan shall be deemed not to be a  deferral of compensation  subject to Section 409A to the extent provided in the exceptions in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(4) ( short-term deferrals ) and (b)(9) ( separation pay plans,  including the exception under subparagraph (iii)) and other applicable provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1 through A 6. 
  (b)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan or elsewhere, any payment or benefit under this Plan or otherwise that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to final Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A) or (C) shall be paid or provided to the Participant only to the extent that the expenses are not incurred, or the benefits are not provided, beyond the last day of the Participant s second taxable year following the Participant s taxable year in which the  separation from service  occurs; and provided further that such expenses are reimbursed no later than the last day of the Participant s third taxable year following the taxable year in which the Participant s  separation from service  occurs.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Plan is determined to be subject to Section 409A, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one (1) calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan or elsewhere, in the event that a Participant waives the provisions of another severance or change in control agreement or arrangement to participate in this Plan and such participation in this Plan is later determined to be a  substitution  (within the meaning of Section 409A) for the benefits under such agreement or arrangement, then any payment or benefit under this Plan that such Participant becomes entitled to receive during the remainder of the waived term of such agreement or arrangement shall be payable in accordance with the time and form of payment provisions of such agreement or arrangement.   
  19.        Certain Reductions; Recoupment  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any payments or benefits payable to a Participant under this Plan shall be subject to reduction to the extent that such payment or benefit would exceed the amount permitted to be paid under the Corporation s Policy Regarding Shareholder Approval of Future Senior Officer Severance Arrangements as in effect as of the date of termination or, if earlier, immediately prior to a Change in Control (the  Policy ), as in effect from time to time, and such amounts are not approved by, or are not submitted for the approval of, the Corporation s shareholders in accordance with such policy.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, in no event shall any payment or benefit under this Plan be paid, provided or accrued, if any such payment, provision or accrual would be in violation of applicable law, rule or regulation (   Applicable Law   ).  In addition, to the extent that any provision of Applicable Law or any recoupment policy or practice of the Corporation as in effect from time to time requires any payments or benefits paid (or provided or to be paid or provided) to a Participant to be forfeited or recouped from the Participant, each such payment or benefit shall be subject to forfeiture or recoupment, as applicable, and such Participant s right to receive or retain each such payment or benefit shall terminate.  Without limiting the foregoing, if the Corporation reasonably believes that a Participant engaged in fraud, or directly or indirectly caused or contributed to any financial restatement or other irregularity during the performance period to which a cash incentive award paid hereunder relates, the Corporation may require the Participant to repay some or all of such award within three (3) years after the award date. 
  20.        Effective Date  .  The Plan shall be effective as of July 13, 2010.

Appendix A   Reduction of Certain Payments by the Corporation 
  (a)        Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) any payment, award, benefit or distribution (or any acceleration of any payment, award, benefit or distribution) by the Corporation  (or any of its affiliated entities) or any entity which effectuates a Change in Control (or any of its affiliated entities) to or for the benefit of Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (the    Payments   ) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (the    Excise Tax   ), and (ii) the reduction of the amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement to the maximum amount that could be paid to Executive without giving rise to the Excise Tax (the    Safe Harbor Cap   ) would provide the Executive with a greater after tax amount than if such amounts were not reduced, then the amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Cap.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing first the payments under paragraph (i) and then paragraph (ii) of Section 3(a) or Section 3(b), as applicable, unless an alternative method of reduction is elected by the Participant within thirty (30) days after first becoming eligible to participate in this Plan.   
  (b)        All determinations required to be made under this Appendix A, including the reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by a public accounting firm that is retained by the Corporation as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the    Accounting Firm   ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Corporation and the Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Corporation or the Participant that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Corporation (collectively, the    Determination   ).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Firm may use the Option Redetermination amount in determining the reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the HRCC shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (ii) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (iii) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the person(s) effecting the Change in Control, the HRCC shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall enter into any agreement reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with the performance of the services hereunder.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by a Participant, it shall furnish the Participant with a written opinion to such effect, and to the effect that failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on the Participant s applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  In the event the Accounting Firm determines that the Payments shall be reduced to the Safe Harbor Cap, it shall furnish the Participant with a written opinion to such effect.  The Determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Participant. 
  In the event that the Corporation determines that the value of any accelerated vesting of stock options held by the Participant shall be redetermined within the context of Treasury Regulation  1.280G-1 Q/A 33 (the    Option Redetermination   ), the Participant shall (i) file with the Internal Revenue Service an amended federal income tax return that claims a refund of the overpayment of the Excise Tax attributable to such Option Redetermination and (ii) promptly pay the refunded Excise Tax to the Corporation;   provided   that the Corporation shall pay on a current basis all reasonable professional fees incurred in the preparation of the Participant s amended federal income tax return.  In the event that amounts payable to the Participant under this Plan were reduced pursuant to paragraph (a) and subsequently the Participant determines there has been an Option Redetermination that reduces the value of the Payments attributable to such options, the Corporation shall pay to the Participant (on the first business day of the calendar month following the month the Option Redetermination is made) any amounts payable under this Plan that were not previously paid solely as a result of the second paragraph of Paragraph (a) up to the Safe Harbor Cap plus interest, from the date the Participant files the amended return as provided above, at the three (3) month Treasury Bill rate.
