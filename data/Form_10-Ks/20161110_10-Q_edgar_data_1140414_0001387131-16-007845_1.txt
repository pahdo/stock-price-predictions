   CAUTIONARY NOTICE
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

  We desire to take advantage of the  safe harbor 
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Report contains a number of forward-looking statements
that reflect management s current views and expectations with respect to our business, strategies, future results and events,
and financial performance. All statements made in this Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements that
address operating performance, the economy, events or developments that management expects or anticipates will or may occur in
the future, including statements related to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations, and cash flows and financing
are forward-looking statements. In particular, the words such as  believe,   expect,   intend, 
 anticipate,   estimate,   may,   will,   can,   plan, 
 predict,   could,   future,  variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking
statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is
not forward-looking.  

  Readers should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which are based on management s current expectations and projections about future events, are
not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and apply only as of the date of this
Report. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as the results
expressed in, anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements.  

  In particular, our business,
including our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern may be impacted by a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:  

Our ability to pay off our debt to Sher Trucking, LLC and to Hillair Capital Investments, L.P.;    

Our ability to fund our 2016 and 2017 customer growth plans;    

Our ability to retain the services of our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and other key employees, the loss of which could materially impair our business plan;    

Changes in the commodity prices of crude oil on a global level;    

Our ability to control or reduce operating expenses and manage unforeseen costs;    

Our ability to fund and acquire suitable levels of rolling stock assets subsequent to selling our collateralized rolling stock;    

Our ability to maintain our existing property leases and acquire rights on properties that we desire;    

Environmental risks from our crude oil trucking operations;    

Our ability to compete successfully against larger, well-funded, established crude oil trucking companies;    

Our ability to comply with the many US Department of Transportation regulations to which our business is subject; and    

Dilutive and other adverse effects on our existing shareholders and our stock price arising from future securities issuances.    
 
  For a more detailed discussion of some of the factors
that may affect our business, results and prospects, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, 2016, as well as various disclosures made by us in our other reports

  (UNAUDITED)  

  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS  

  Description of Business  

 Legend Oil and Gas, Ltd. (the  Company 
or  Legend ) is a crude oil hauling and trucking company with principal operations in the Bakken region of North Dakota
and the Permian Basin in Texas. These crude oil hauling operations commenced through our acquisition of Black Diamond Energy Holdings,
LLC ( Maxxon ) on April 3, 2015. Our business focus is to expand our crude oil hauling operations into other
basins within Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma. Our operations are managed by employees based principally in North Dakota and Denver,
Colorado, with the Company s contract CEO and CFO based out of Georgia. 

 Further, through October 27, 2015, we were
also an oil and gas exploration, development and production company; this business was to acquire producing and non-producing oil
and gas interests and develop oil and gas properties that we owned or in which we had a leasehold interest. Our oil and gas property
interests were located in the United States (Kansas and Oklahoma). On October 27, 2015, we sold our oil and gas exploration operations
and we have presented those operations as discontinued operations. 

  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

  Principles of Consolidation  

 The condensed consolidated financial statements at
and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 include the accounts of the Company, and our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Black Diamond Energy Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Maxxon Energy, LLC and Treeline Diesel Center, LLC. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

  Basis of Presentation  

 In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. However, the financial statements do not include
all of the disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or those normally
made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 for such disclosures. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived
from the audited consolidated balance sheet as of that date. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should
be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

  Reclassifications  

 Certain information from the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, and at December 31, 2015, have been reclassified to conform with the current
period s presentation in connection with our discontinued operations. 

 In the Company s statement of cash flows included
in Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company classified its cash flows attributable to the repayment
of notes payable as  net cash used in financing activities   discontinued operations  as a result of its decision
to dispose of its oil and gas exploration segment as described in Note 1. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, management
reevaluated the nature of the Company s notes payable and determined that such note payable is attributable to continuing
activities.  Accordingly, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 present the cash flow activity relating to the Company s notes payable as  net cash used in financing activities
  continuing operations .  The following table presents amounts which were included in the condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows included in Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 which have been reclassified
to conform to the current presentation. 

Assets held for sale - discontinued operations   

 We own a drilling rig which we have classified as an asset
held for sale, which is part of our discontinued operations. Long-lived assets that are expected to be recovered through a sale
or disposition are classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are evaluated for impairment using the lower
of fair value less disposal costs and carrying value. Assets held for sale are not depreciated. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no impairment loss was recorded. 

  Net Loss Per Common Share  

 The computation of basic net loss per common share
is based on the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period, including contingently redeemable common
stock. The computation of diluted net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares used in the basic
net loss per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive
common shares outstanding. All potentially dilutive shares or convertible instruments outstanding for the nine month periods September
30, 2016 and 2015 were anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares include convertible preferred stock and convertible debentures. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

 From time to time, new accounting
pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the
Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently
issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations
upon adoption. 

 In March, 2016, FASB issued
accounting standards update (ASU) 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,
which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. The guidance in this update addresses several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payments, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  

 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses from continuing operations of
approximately $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company is dependent on a
small number of customers in obtaining its revenue goals. Further, obtaining additional debt and/or equity financing to
roll-out and scale its planned principal business operations may be limited due to our losses from operations. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 Management s plans in regard to these matters
consist principally of seeking additional debt and/or equity financing combined with restructuring its current debt obligations,
and expected cash flows from our crude oil hauling company and assets that it may acquire. There can be no assurance that the Company s
efforts will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

  NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

 The amount of capitalized costs related to property
and equipment and the amount of related accumulated depreciation and impairment are as follows: 

The drilling rig, in the amount of $398,680 (net
of accumulated depreciation of $66,320) was previously included in property and equipment, and has been reclassified to
assets held for sale - discontinued operations, as the Company has ceased all drilling operations. During the third quarter
of 2015, the Company fully impaired the value of their Treeline Diesel Center, LLC subsidiary assets with a carrying value of
$224,835 (net of accumulated depreciation of $33,108). 

 In February 2016, the Company exchanged vehicles with
a carrying value of $184,439 for new vehicles with a purchase price of $198,210. In addition, the vehicles traded were financed
with an outstanding principal balance of $166,614 owed at the date of the exchange, which was extinguished in full. The Company
assumed liabilities for the new vehicles of $211,659. Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on the disposition of the vehicles
of $31,272 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

 In September 2016, the Company sold 19
fleet vehicles with a net book value of $1,235,346 (net of accumulated depreciation of $428,654) through Ritchie
Bros. Auctioneers (America) Inc. The Company received $158,355 in proceeds, resulting in a recorded loss on the sale of the
vehicles of $1,076,991 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

 The Company recorded depreciation expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the amount of $179,865 and $216,541, respectively, and $557,120 and
$406,951, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

  NOTE 5   INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

 The amount of intangible assets related to Maxxon
acquisition and the amount of related accumulated amortization and impairment are as follows: 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company assessed its
goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was fully impaired.  Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company removed goodwill and the corresponding accumulated impairment from the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements. Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was $12,298 and $0, respectively, and $36,625 and $0, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

  NOTE 6   LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION  

 The asset retirement obligation recorded as of both
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was related to the Van Pelt lease, a non-producing field and discontinued operation
we acquired during 2015, and for which we still own the lease as of September 30, 2016. The asset retirement obligation at
both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $118,425 and $96,129, respectively, and has been included within
liabilities of discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded $0 and $13,328 in
accretion expense of the asset retirement obligation liability during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The Company recorded $22,296  and
$18,113 in accretion expense of the asset retirement obligation liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  

  NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

 As of December 31, 2015, there was an amount due to
Northpoint Energy Partners ( NPE ), of which our CEO is a principal, in the amount of $120,000, as a result of the
bonus accrual under the NPE letter agreement for CEO services, which was paid out during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Additionally, there is an accrued bonus to NPE at September 30, 2016, which has not yet been paid, for services rendered during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

 Additionally, during the current year, we grouped together the December 31, 2015 accrued
interest   related party in the amount of $10,034 within the accounts payable and accrued expenses line on the accompanying
balance sheet. 

NOTE 8    Convertible
debt   related party   

  On October 22, 2015,
the Company consummated a Securities Purchase Agreement with Hillair Capital Investments, LP ( Hillair ) pursuant to
which it issued an Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture in the aggregate amount of $654,000, payable in

net proceeds of $475,000, net of original issue discount, legal and diligence fees, which were recorded as a debt discount within
the convertible debt - related party line of the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.     

  On
August 21, 2016,   we entered into a convertible debenture with Hillair totaling $385,000,
payable in full on March 1, 2018. This debenture is convertible into 12,833,333 of our common shares at $0.03 per share. We received
net proceeds of $340,000, net of original issue discount, legal and diligence fees, which were recorded as a debt discount within
the convertible debt - related party line of the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.     

  On
September 30, 2016, we entered into a convertible line of credit facility with Lorton Finance Company ( Lorton ),
an affiliate of Hillair, due on September 30, 2019. The aggregate amount of this facility is $2,000,000, with the initial draw
by us of $1,150,000. There is an amount remaining on the facility at September 30, 2016,
of $850,000 .  The portion of this credit facility is convertible on future draws we make above the initial draw of $1,150,000.
These subsequent draws, when made, convert into our Series B Preferred Stock in amounts equivalent to five percent (5%) of the
amount of the draw divided by the $1,000 stated value of the Series B Preferred Stock.  Each of these preferred shares is
convertible into our common stock at $0.03 per share. The facility bears interest at the rate of 20% per annum, payable monthly
beginning March 31, 2017. Beginning September 30, 2017, the Company is obligated to make monthly principal payments of $47,917.
The facility is secured by titles to 19 trucks owned by the Company s subsidiaries. After taking into account legal and
diligence fees, and the payment in full of our line of credit with State Bank   Trust Company (see Note 9) in the amount of
$274,955, the net proceeds received by the Company was $787,500.   

  The
total debt discount and deferred financing costs for the convertible debentures amount to $596,205 and $89,323 (net of
accumulated amortization of $170,816 and $14,677) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company
amortized to interest expense, the debt discounts and deferred financing costs associated with its convertible debentures in
the amount of $91,951 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $156,139 and $0 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  Convertible Preferred Stock  

 On October 22, 2015, the Company consummated a Securities
Exchange Agreement with Hillair, its majority shareholder, pursuant to which it issued 9,643 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock (the  Series B Preferred Shares ) in exchange for the cancellation of debentures held by Hillair with a total
principal value of $9,642,546 and accrued interest of $182,430. The shares are convertible into 327,499,200 shares of our common
stock at $0.03 per share. 

 The Company had issued and outstanding 600 shares of
its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. This convertible preferred stock has a 0% dividend rate. The shares of preferred stock
are convertible into 600 million shares of the Company s common stock at $0.0001 per share, and have a non-dilution provision.
The shares were converted to 600 million shares of common stock in May 2015. 

  Common Stock Issuances

of common stock to Albert Valentin as part of its purchase of Maxxon. The stock had a fair value of $526,741. The fair value of
the common stock was determined using the closing price of the shares on the grant date. 

 In December 2015, the Company issued 57,682,644 shares
of common stock to Steven Wallace as part of its purchase of Maxxon. The stock had a fair value of $334,559. The fair value of
the common stock was determined using the closing price of the shares on the grant date. 

 On March 2, 2016, the Company issued common stock to
an employee. A total of 6 million shares were issued with a fair value of $10,800 using the closing market price on the date of

  NOTE 11   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

 The amounts of net assets related to
the discontinued operations of the Company s oil and gas operations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $280,255
and $302,551, respectively. The table below summarizes the operations of the Company s oil and gas activities for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

NOTE 12   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

 The Company is not aware of any pending or threatened
legal proceedings, nor is the Company aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings, affecting any current officer, director
or control shareholder, or their affiliates. 

 As part of its regular operations, the Company may
become party to various pending or threatened claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies
concerning its  commercial operations, products, employees and other matters. Although the Company can give no assurance
about the outcome of these or any other pending legal and administrative proceedings and the effect such outcomes may have on the
Company, the Company believes that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise
provided for or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results
of operations. 

 On February 15, 2016, the Company entered into a trailer
lease agreement with Wallwork Truck Center. The Company leased 10 trailers at a monthly rent of $17,335 for 48 months commencing
on February 12, 2016 and continuing until February 12, 2020. 

 The Company leases office space on a month-to-month
basis, with monthly rental payments due of approximately $2,200. The Company leases office space, a diesel repair shop, and employee
housing under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases provide that we pay taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance expenses
related to the leased assets. During March 2016, we entered into a restructured lease agreement with the property owner/landlord,
where the facility lease has been restructured to a 60 month lease commencing April 1, 2016.  The restructured lease indicates
that we will not pay any cash lease payments while we deplete our $120,000 security deposit held by the landlord, which is included
in other assets on the accompanying balance sheets. The revised lease and its payment structure will be such that we will use the
funds contained in the security deposit in the amount of $6,000 per month as rent expense (in lieu of cash payments) while WTI
oil prices remain below $60.00 per barrel, for any 30 day period. When the price of WTI oil goes above $60.00 per barrel but less
than $80.00 per barrel for any 30 day period, we will use the revised amount against our deposit of $7,500 per month. Upon the
price of WTI oil being above the $80.00 per barrel level for a 30 day period, the Company s rent payment will be $10,000
per month, the maximum rental payment under the restructured lease agreement. 

  NOTE 13   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

 The Company has evaluated events and transactions
subsequent to September 30, 2016 and through the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were included in this
Form 10-Q and filed with the SEC. 

 On October 27, 2016, we entered into a
debenture agreement with Lorton to draw an additional $300,000 against the available line of credit facility. In exchange
for this debenture, Lorton paid Sher, directly, for which the payment paid down $300,000 of principal and fully released the
collateral (12 trucks) against the note payable to Sher. Due to the conversion feature associated with the Lorton credit facility, this draw results in our issuance
of approximately 15 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Lorton. 

 On October 31, 2016, we entered
into a convertible debenture with Hillair totaling $440,000, payable in full on March 1, 2018. This debenture is convertible into
13,333,333 of our common shares at $0.03 per share. We received net proceeds of $390,000, net of original issue discount, legal
and diligence fees. 

ITEM 2   
         MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
 
  The following discussion and analysis is based upon
our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes. We incorporate by reference
into this Report our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, the following discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed
in  Forward Looking Statements,  and elsewhere in this Report.  

 The following management s discussion and analysis
is intended to assist in understanding the principal factors affecting our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources
and contractual cash obligations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements
which are incorporated by reference herein, information about our business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors,
and the transactions that underlie our financial results, which are included in various parts of this filing. 

 For ease of presentation in the following discussions
of  Comparison of Results  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources , we round dollar amounts to the nearest
thousand dollars (other than average prices per barrel and per share amounts). 

  Overview of Business  

 On April 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement with Sher Trucking, LLC ( Sher ), the majority owner, and two minority owners, which made
up all of the members of Black Diamond Energy Holdings, LLC ( Maxxon ) to purchase all of the outstanding membership
interests of Maxxon. The Company paid $1,500,000 in cash to Sher; issued a secured promissory note to Sher in the amount of $2,854,000
at 5% per annum, due April 3, 2016 and issued 148,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock to the minority owners, then
valued at $861,300. In April 2016, we restructured this note to Sher, which is further described in detail within Note 9 to the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 Prior to the acquisition of Maxxon, our sole business
focus was to acquire producing and non-producing oil and gas leases and to develop oil and gas properties that we owned or in which
we had a leasehold interest. This is a discontinued operation, as we sold our oil and gas assets in October 2015. 

 Maxxon is our crude oil hauling and trucking subsidiary.
We perform hauling services for large institutional drilling and exploration companies as well as crude oil marketers. Our largest
customers are multi-billion dollar market cap companies, most of which are either publicly held, or large, multi-national private
companies. We principally serve the Permian basin in Texas, as well as the Bakken in North Dakota. 

  Results of Operations  

 The following is a discussion
of our condensed consolidated results of operations, financial condition and capital resources. You should read this discussion
in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained elsewhere in this
report. Comparative results of operations for the periods indicated are discussed below.      

   Oil and gas activities   

 Our oil and gas activities were
discontinued in October 2015. 

   Trucking activities   

 Our subsidiary, Maxxon, had revenue of
$807,489 and $2,810,428 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in total barrels hauled during
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, is due to the acquisition of new customers as
a result of the Company s expansion to Texas and New Mexico, but offset by a substantial decrease in price per barrel
due to the global depression in the oil markets. In order to maintain our customer base, we needed to significantly reduce
our rates per hauled barrel. The average hauling price per barrel received by Maxxon during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $1.37 and $1.67, down from $2.42 and $1.85 per barrel in the same period of 2015. 

 The following table summarizes our barrels hauled for
each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Revenues and cost of revenues   

Gross margin during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 is higher, relative to the same period in 2015,  due to
operational expenses related to repair and maintenance costs for our subsidiary  Treeline Diesel Center, LLC,  in
2015. Treeline ceased operations in 2015, with all assets being impaired in 2015.  The decrease in gross margin
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, is due to the addition of multiple
vehicle lease agreements in 2016 to expand the size of our fleet. The decrease in gross margin during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to the overall nine months ended September 30, 2016, is due to lower hauling rates to
acquire new customers, additional fleet vehicle lease agreements, and higher repair and maintenance costs. 

 The following table summarizes the revenues and cost
of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and Administrative Expenses   

 General and administrative expenses
include: professional fees; management fees; travel expenses; office and administrative expenses; and marketing and SEC
filing expenses. General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, are significantly
higher than the same period in 2015, principally due to the increase in employees and office expenses related to the
expansion of Maxxon s oil hauling operations to Texas and New Mexico, and the relocation of its headquarter to
Colorado. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, is a result of
professional fees, which increased in 2015 due to transaction related costs for the acquisition of Maxxon, and decreased in
2016 due to cost cutting measures implemented by management, as well as a settlement paid in the amount of $2,000, for a
previously accrued amount of approximately $80,000. Thus professional fees were credited by the difference between the
accrued amount and settlement amount. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

 The Company incurred $192,163 for depreciation
and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $216,541 for the same period during 2015. This
slight decrease is related to the sale of 19 fleet vehicles with a net book value of $1,235,346 (net of accumulated
depreciation of $428,654) through Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc in September 2016. Depreciation and amortization
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $593,745 compared to $406,951 for the same period during 2015, reflective of
the acquisition and consolidation of Maxxon.   

   Interest expense   

 Interest expense was $260,070 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $430,765 for the
same period in 2015. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $480,305, compared to $1,134,296 in
2015. Interest expense decrease for the periods presented are principally the result of the conversion by Hillair of certain
debt to preferred and common stock, as well as an offset by an increase in amortization of original issue discounts and deferred
financing costs. 

   Discontinued Operations   

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company accounted for its oil and gas operations as discontinued operations. There were no revenues and minimal costs incurred
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, there was little activity,
as most activity of our discontinued operations occurred in the first three months of 2015. Further, the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows has been reclassified to depict the accounting
for discontinued operations.      

   Change in Fair Value of Derivatives   

 The Company did not have any derivatives during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the change in fair value of derivatives
was $6,551,333, as a result of the Company using the market price on the date of the conversion to value the embedded derivative
liabilities associated with certain convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. 

Net Loss   

  The Company
recorded a net loss of approximately $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of
approximately $11.7 million for that same nine month period in 2015.  The decrease in losses is mainly due to
recognition of the non-cash charge related to the derivative liability discussed above, and the discontinued operations
related to our oil and gas activities.  Further, when evaluating the net loss for the 2015 nine month period, after
reducing the derivative charge as well as our discontinued operations, the same period loss was approximately $3.7
million.  The increase in our loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015, when extracting the above factors, was approximately $0.6 million.  This increase for the 2016 period was the
result of a loss on the sale of assets of approximately $1.1 million, which was slightly offset by cost cutting measures
implemented by management. The decrease in our loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015, is primarily a result of our strategy to decrease the price per barrel charged by Maxxon to attract and gain
new customers to overcome the global oil depression.  

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  

  Liquidity  

  We
have incurred net operating losses and operating cash flow deficits over the past several years, continuing through the quarter
ended September 30, 2016. We sold our oil and gas properties in 2015 and acquired a crude oil hauling company, and we have been
funded primarily by a combination of equity issuances, debentures and borrowings under loan agreements and to a lesser extent
by operating cash flows, to expand our trucking services beyond the Bakken in North Dakota, to the Permian Basin located in Texas
and New Mexico. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net operating losses of $4,323,860 as well as negative
operating cash flows of $2,234,362. However, management believes that based on various cost reductions, increased and normalized
revenue within our core business, as well as continued expansion of trucking operations to Texas and New Mexico, positive cash
flow will result through Maxxon adding overall value to the Company. If volumes and revenue do not increase as expected, we may
be at break-even rates or lower, depending on hauling volumes and revenue. Should this be the case, we would require additional
operating funding in amounts which are not yet determinable. At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling
$840,395. We have currently forecasted losses of approximately $200,000 per month, which are expected to decrease as we obtain
new customers and drive our top line revenue, which should also reduce our net losses.  

 Many of our operating costs have decreased over the year due to the implementation of expense efficiencies,
to levels we believe will effectively operate our business. We expect our additional cash requirements over the next 12 months
to be approximately $2.4 million, including capital additions for tractors, as well as normal corporate general and administrative
expenses. 

 However, should the Company
seek additional financing to fund operations, such financings may not be available and the terms of the financing may only be available
on unfavorable terms. 

 These financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of
liabilities that could result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

 Hillair has been our principal funding source since
2014, and has provided debt capital convertible into various instruments, including common stock, warrants. Further, Hillair has
acquired preferred stock as well as converted certain preferred stock into common stock. They have provided us total capital through
debt and preferred stock instruments of over $13.5 million in face value since 2014. 

Cash from Operating Activities   

Cash used in operating activities was $2,234,362 and $2,231,800
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 sand 2015, respectively. For 2015, cash used in operating activities includes
Maxxon s operations as of April 3, 2015, resulting in six months of operating activity with Maxxon during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015, compared to nine months of operating activity with Maxxon during the same period in 2016. Operating
cash flow uses in 2016 have been reduced significantly from the same period of 2015 due to relatively strong cost controls put
into place by management during 2016. 

Cash from Investing Activities   

Cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $142,700 and $451,000, respectively. The cash flows used
in investing activities for 2016 include payment in full of approximately $183,400, on the purchase of three
tractors, a $60,400 down payment on the purchase of thirteen crude hauling trailers, and capitalized expenses related to
these purchases, which were partially offset by $158,400 in proceeds for the sale of assets. During the same 2015, period
from continuing operations, payments were made on the purchase of fixed assets in the amount of approximately $0.5 million
and cash paid for the purchase of Black Diamond of approximately $1.1 million (net of cash received of approximately $0.4
million). During 2015, the cash flows provided by discontinued operations consisted of cash received from the sale of two oil
and gas properties of approximately $1.67 million, offset by the costs incurred of approximately $.6 million for the
development of oil and gas properties. 

Cash from Financing Activities   

 Total net cash provided by financing
activities was $2,753,917 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisting of proceeds of notes payable to Hillair
and Lorton, an affiliate of Hillair, offset by payments on short term debt. Total net cash provided by financing activities
in the same period in 2015 was $2,548,287, consisting principally of amounts received from Hillair for the acquisition of
Maxxon, as well as funds provided for the purchase of twelve fleet trucks. 

  Off Balance Sheet Financing Activities  

 We have no off balance sheet financing
activities. 

  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

ITEM 4   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

 Our management evaluated, with the participation of
our President and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our President and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 Such conclusion was reached based on the following
material weaknesses noted by management: 

a)  
      We have a lack of segregation of duties and limited resources to devote to our framework for internal controls due to the small size of the Company.   

b)  
      Lack of controls that provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposal of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Management is in the process of remediating these
weaknesses, with the hire of a controller in May 2015, and is continuing to expand the accounting department. 

 Our disclosure controls and procedures include components
of our internal control over financial reporting and, as such, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management. Management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance that the control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met (see
the section below in this Item 4 entitled  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls ). 

Changes in Internal Controls Over
Financial Reporting  

 There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that
occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

  Limitations on the Effectiveness
of Internal Controls  

 Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our President
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
