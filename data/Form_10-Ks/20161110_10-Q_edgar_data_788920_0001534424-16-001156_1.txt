NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements of Pro-Dex, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our ,  Pro-Dex 
or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Recent Accounting
Standards 

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers,  which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising
from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU
2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires
enhanced revenue related disclosures. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations  ASU 2016-10, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . In July 2015, the
FASB deferred the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption of the standard is permitted,
but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2017. This update permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative
effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the guidance, including which transition approach will be applied and the
estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-02, (Topic 842)  Leases . The objective of this update is to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about
leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those annual periods and is to be applied utilizing a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the new guidance
to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
This update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes,
forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted. Based on the fact that all of our issued and outstanding options are fully vested, this guidance will impact our
accounting based upon future grants of stock based awards, if any. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments .
This update provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement
of zero-coupon bonds; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance
policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and
(8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted.
We do not expect the application of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications 

The short-term portion
of deferred rent, in the amount of $79,000 as of June 30, 2016, has been reclassified to accrued liabilities to conform to the
current period presentation. This reclassification had no impact on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

NOTE 2. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

We specialize in the
design and manufacture of powered surgical and dental instruments and multi-axis motion control systems, and serve such markets
as medical, research and industrial. Pro-Dex s products are found in hospitals, dental offices, medical engineering labs,
scientific research facilities and high tech manufacturing operations around the world. 

During fiscal 2015
we acquired Fineline Molds ( Fineline ) and Huber Precision ( Huber ), businesses that manufacture plastic
injection molds and machined parts, respectively, for a wide variety of industries. We also provide engineering consulting and
placement services, as well as quality and regulatory consulting services through our Engineering Services Division.

STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

Intangibles  

Intangibles consist of the following (in
thousands): 

Capitalized software
development costs relate to internally developed software, which was fully amortized during last fiscal year and both the software
development costs and corresponding accumulated amortization were offset during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Both the covenant
not to compete and the customer list and backlog relate to assets acquired in conjunction with the business acquisitions described
in Note 2 above and are being amortized over various periods not to exceed ten years. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017,
we recognized an impairment charge for the remaining un-amortized customer list related to the Huber business in the amount of
$113,000, as we do not expect there to be any significant future cash flows resulting from these customer relationships. The trade
name relates exclusively to Fineline and has an indefinite life, subject to impairment loss assessment annually, or more frequently
if certain conditions exist. Patent-related costs consist of legal fees incurred in connection with both patent applications and
a patent issuance, and will be amortized over the estimated life of the product(s) that is or will be utilizing the technology,
or expensed immediately in the event the patent office denies the issuance of the patent. 

NOTE 4. DUE FROM FACTOR   

On September 9, 2015,
we entered a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Summit Loan ) with Summit Financial Resources LP (the  Factor )
whereby we can borrow up to $1.0 million against our eligible receivables, on a revolving basis, as defined in the agreement. Borrowed
funds will bear interest at a rate of prime plus 2 percent, and incur an additional administrative fee of 0.7 percent on the monthly
average outstanding balance. The Summit Loan has an initial period of 18 months with successive one year renewal options and requires
an annual facility fee of $10,000. 

As of September 30,
2016, the total amount of receivables that have been assigned to the Factor pursuant to the Summit Loan is $2.1 million and we
bear the risk of loss in the event of non-payment by the customers. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we borrowed
$400,000 under the Summit Loan, which amount was paid in full by September 30, 2016. Therefore, at September 30, 2016, we had no
outstanding borrowings against the Summit Loan. 

NOTE 5. WARRANTY  

The warranty accrual
is based on historical costs of warranty repairs and expected future identifiable warranty expenses, and is included in accrued
expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the warranty reserve amounted
to $349,000 and $365,000, respectively. Warranty expenses are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. Changes in estimates to previously established warranty accruals result from current period updates to assumptions
regarding repair costs and warranty return rates, and are included in current period warranty expense.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

Information regarding
the accrual for warranty costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 6. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE  

The Company calculates
basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the reporting period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the effects of potentially dilutive securities, which consist entirely
of outstanding stock options. 

Potential common shares
of 18,622 have been excluded from diluted weighted average common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as the effect
would have been anti-dilutive. The following table presents reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of the basic and
diluted income (loss) per share computations. In the tables below, income (loss) amounts represent the numerator, and share amounts
represent the denominator (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES  

Deferred income taxes
are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences. Temporary
differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax
laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

10  

PRO-DEX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

Significant management
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Such determination
is based primarily on our historical taxable income or loss, with some consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income
or loss by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable. Due to cumulative
taxable losses from continuing operations during the past three years, we maintained a valuation allowance of $3.7 million against
our deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016. Our valuation allowance may be released during the current
fiscal year, as we expect to have future taxable income during the remainder of the current fiscal year in amounts sufficient enough to create cumulative income over a three
year look back, coupled with projections of future taxable income, however, there can be no assurance that this will occur. 

As of September
30, 2016, we have accrued $454,000 of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal and state income tax matters. None of this balance
is expected to reduce the Company s income tax expense if recognized. 

A reconciliation of
the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): 

We recognize accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits when applicable. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, no interest
or penalties applicable to our unrecognized tax benefits have been accrued since we have sufficient tax attributes available to
fully offset any potential assessment of additional tax. 

The Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of multiple state tax jurisdictions. We are currently
open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended June 30, 2013 and later. Our
state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended June 30, 2012 and later. However,
because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our tax years are subject to audit. We do
not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 

NOTE 8. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  

Through June 2014
we had two equity compensation plans, the Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Option Plan (the  Employee Stock Option
Plan ) and the Amended and Restated 2004 Directors  Stock Option Plan (the  Directors  Stock Option Plan )
(collectively, the  Stock Option Plans ). The Stock Option Plans were substantially similar, providing for a strike
price equal to the closing price for a share of our common stock as of the last business day immediately prior to the grant date,
vesting periods as determined by the Board for the Employee Stock Option Plan and six months for the Directors  Stock Option
Plan, and terms of up to ten years, subject to forfeit 30 days after the holder ceases to be an employee or 90 days after the holder
ceases to be a director, as the case may be. Share-based compensation expense under the Stock Option Plans for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $2,000, respectively. 

In June 2014, our Board
of Directors terminated the Employee Stock Option Plan, with the provision that options outstanding under the Employee Stock Option
Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms. At the date of termination, 531,381 shares were reserved
for issuance under the Employee Stock Option Plan in excess of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, all of which shares
were reallocated for issuance under the provisions of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below.

PRO-DEX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

In September 2014,
our Board approved the inclusion in our proxy statement for approval by our shareholders at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
its recommendation to terminate the Directors  Stock Option Plan, which proposal was approved by our shareholders at the
December 3, 2014 Annual Meeting. At September 30, 2014, 173,334 shares were reserved for issuance under the Directors  Stock
Option Plan, all of which shares were reallocated for issuance under the provisions of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described
below. 

Stock Options  

There were no stock
options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, there was no unrecognized
compensation cost under the Stock Option Plans as all outstanding stock options are fully vested. Following is a summary of stock
option activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Following is a summary
of information regarding options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016: 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

Also in September 2014,
our Board approved the establishment of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), which was similarly approved
by our shareholders at the December 3, 2014 Annual Meeting. The ESPP conforms to the provisions of Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code, has coterminous offering and purchase periods of six months, and bases the pricing to purchase shares of our common
stock on a formula so as to result in a per share purchase price that approximates a 15% discount from the market price of a share
of our common stock at the end of the purchase period. The Board of Directors also approved the provision that shares formerly
reserved for issuance under the Stock Option Plans in excess of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding options, aggregating 704,715
shares, be reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. During the first quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 2,056 and 1,925
shares were purchased, respectively, and allocated to employees based upon their contributions at prices of $4.91 and $2.34, respectively,
per share. On a cumulative basis, since the inception of the ESPP plan, employees have purchased a total of 7,652 shares. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded stock compensation expense in the amount of $2,000 and $1,000,
respectively, relating to the ESPP.

Summit Financial Resources LP  

As discussed in Note
4, on September 9, 2015 we entered into the Summit Loan, whereby we can borrow up to $1.0 million against our eligible receivables,
on a revolving basis, as defined in the agreement. Borrowed funds will bear interest at a rate of prime plus 2 percent, and incur
an additional administrative fee of 0.7 percent on the monthly average outstanding balance. The Summit Loan has an initial period
of 18 months with successive one year renewal options and requires an annual facility fee of $10,000. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016 we borrowed $400,000 under the Summit Loan, which amount was paid in full by September 30, 2016.

Jules   Associates  

On July 21, 2016, we
entered a master equipment lease agreement with Jules and Associates, Inc. to lease a specific machine used in our inspection process.
The cost of the equipment was approximately $106,000 and the lease provides for 36 monthly payments in the amount of $3,121, as
well as interim rent in the amount of $7,388. The lease was subsequently assigned to Hitachi Capital America Corporation. The balance
owed on the lease as of September 30, 2016 is approximately $96,000. 

Fineline Molds  

In conjunction with
our acquisition of Fineline, we issued a promissory note to Fineline in the amount of $100,000 which bears interest at 4% per annum
and requires sixteen equal quarterly payments of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $6,794. The note is secured by
all of the assets acquired by us from Fineline and is subordinate to the security interest created by the Summit Loan. The balance
owed on the note as of September 30, 2016 is approximately $64,000. 

Fortitude Income Funds  

The Company borrowed
$500,000 from Fortitude Income Funds, LLC under a promissory note dated September 8, 2015. The loan bore interest at 12 percent
per annum, contained a loan origination fee of $15,000 plus expenses, and required monthly interest only payments until its maturity
originally scheduled on March 15, 2016. The loan was repaid in full on February 22, 2016. 

NOTE 11. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  

In September, 2013
our Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 750,000 shares of our common stock. In
accordance with, and as part of this share repurchase program, our Board approved, on March 22, 2016, the adoption of second prearranged
share repurchase plan intended to qualify for the safe harbor Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
( 10b5-1 Plan  or  Plan ). The Plan became effective on March 23, 2016 and terminated on July 6, 2016 in
accordance with its provisions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 9,107 shares at an aggregate cost of
$49,000, inclusive of fees. On a cumulative basis we have repurchased a total of 178,568 shares at an aggregate cost of $658,000.
All repurchases under all 10b5-1 Plans were administered through an independent broker. 

NOTE 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION  

The Company has four
reportable segments based on its current business activities and organization: 

Pro-Dex located in Irvine, California   providing primarily medical and dental instruments using shared production and assembly machines and workforce. This segment also incorporates Huber as the revenues and assets of Huber are not material to the Company s total revenues and assets.  Additionally, effective November 30, 2015 the former San Carlos office of Huber was closed and all orders shipped since that date are manufactured at the Irvine facility.  

OMS located in Beaverton, Oregon   providing multi-axis motion control applications.  

Fineline located in San Dimas, California.  This business was purchased on February 1, 2015 and is a manufacturer of plastic injection molds for a variety of industries.

Engineering Services Division or ( ESD ). This division was launched in fiscal 2015 to provide permanent placement and contract services in the fields of engineering, manufacturing and quality to diverse businesses.  

In deciding how to
allocate resources and assess performance, the Company s chief executive officer regularly evaluates the sales and operating income
of these segments. Operating income is the gross margin of the segment less direct expenses of the segment. Unallocated corporate
expenses include our corporate administrative cost center, which primarily includes costs associated with being a public company,
and is a subset of total general and administrative expenses. Additionally, other costs incurred in our general and administrative
expenses ( G A ) including salaries and other personnel-related expenses for corporate, accounting, finance and
human resource personnel, as well as costs for outsourced information technology services, are not allocated by segment internally
and are included in Pro-Dex in the tables below. The following tables summarize segment performance for the first quarter of fiscal
2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Legal Matters  

On August 1, 2016,
we received correspondence from an attorney representing Scott Robertson, the former president of Riverside Manufacturing, Inc.,
claiming damages owed under claims of breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, wrongful self-help eviction among others. The
letter requested a payment of $250,000 within 10 days of the date of the letter to fully settle the matter. We have made no such
payment nor have we accrued any amounts related to this matter. On August 12, 2016, we responded to the letter indicating that
we believe each and every claim has no legal merit. Additionally, on September 8, 2016, we sent a follow up correspondence asserting
claims against Mr. Robertson including slander of title, fraudulent misrepresentation, conversion and theft. In October, 2016 both
parties filed a lawsuit against one another asserting the aforementioned claims. While we believe that we will prevail should this
matter go to trial, there can be no assurances that we will be successful should this matter be litigated.

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT S
                                         DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.   

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

The following discussion
and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations
and financial condition of Pro-Dex, Inc. ( Company ,  Pro-Dex ,  we ,  our  or
 us ) for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction
with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This report contains
certain forward-looking statements and information. The cautionary statements included herein should be read as being applicable

Basis of Presentation 

The condensed consolidated
results of operation presented in this report are not audited and those results are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the entirety of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 or any other interim period during such fiscal year. Our fiscal
year ends on June 30 and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, and March 31. Unless otherwise stated, all
dates refer to our fiscal year and those fiscal quarters. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

An accounting policy
is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain
at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting
estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Management believes that there have
been no significant changes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting
policies in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

Business Strategy and Future Plans 

Our business today
is almost entirely driven by sales of our medical products. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we began shipments related to a
customer s unique surgical handpiece designed for use in orthopedic surgery applications. This customer has provided us with
purchase orders for delivery of this product through the end of calendar 2017 and additionally has provided us with a separate
purchase commitment for orders throughout calendar 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of 2016 we
completed the design of two distinct CMF surgical drivers for two different customers. Sales of these devices are expected to last
for five to seven years based upon the term of each underlying supply agreement and both agreements allow for automatic renewals
of one to two years. We continue to focus a significant percentage of our time and resources on providing outstanding products
and service to our valued principal customers. Additionally, we are currently undertaking cost reduction analysis relating to our
newest products, because they have a lower product margin than our legacy products. During fiscal 2016 we implemented a second-shift
for production which is currently running at approximately 20% capacity. We believe that we can expand our capacity by adding work
force to our second shift and may eventually consider a third-shift for production if needed. 

Simultaneously, we
are working to build top-line sales through active proposals of new medical device products with new and existing customers, and
anticipate completing another ongoing engineering project during fiscal 2017, which we believe will lead to the addition of another
significant product launch in fiscal 2017 as well. Additionally, we continue to seek additional revenue streams through our Engineering
Services Division ( ESD ) by offering both temporary/contract and full-time employee placements to other customers
in diverse industries. 

In summary, our current
objectives are focused primarily on maintaining our relationships with our current medical device customers, completing cost-reductions
relating to our newest products, completing our ongoing development projects, and continuing to promote active product development
proposals to new and existing customers for both orthopedic shavers and screw drivers for a multitude of surgical applications
while monitoring closely the progress of all these individual endeavors. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in any of these objectives.

Results of Operations 

The following tables
set forth results from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Revenue

The
majority of our revenue is derived from designing, developing and manufacturing surgical devices for the medical device and dental
industries and motion control software and hardware for industrial and scientific applications. The proportion of total sales
by type is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):  

Certain
of our medical device products utilize proprietary designs developed by us under exclusive development and supply agreements. All
of our medical device products utilize proprietary manufacturing methods and know-how, and are manufactured in our Irvine, California
facility, as are our dental products, which are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and dental product distributors.
We design and manufacture embedded multi-axis motion controllers in our facility in Beaverton, Oregon. 

19  

Revenue
increased $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in medical device revenue. Our
medical device revenue has increased $1.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to an increase in sales of a surgical
handpiece designed to be used in orthopedic surgery applications as we continue to ramp our production levels to ship to the expected
150 units per month that the customer has requested. Separately, our former largest customer has informed us that they will be
replacing a primary product that we sell them with one that they will manufacture in the future. This customer accounted for approximately
$575,000 in medical device revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We anticipate revenue to this customer to
decrease significantly during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decline in sales to this customer is also the primary reason
for the reduction in repair revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period of the prior
fiscal year. We expect our repair revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2017 will continue to be less than in the prior year as our
other primary medical device products are new and most repairs are covered under warranty. We anticipate that sales of our other
medical devices to other customers will increase sufficiently to offset the expected decreases in sales from our former largest
medical device customer, but there can be no assurance that this will occur. 

At September
30, 2016, we had a backlog of approximately $18.5 million. Of the backlog, approximately $11.5 million is expected to be delivered
in fiscal 2017 and the remainder is scheduled for delivery during fiscal 2018. We may experience variability in our new order bookings
due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, the timing of major new product launches and customer planned inventory
builds. However, we do not typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our shipments and revenues. 

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin    

Cost of sales for the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 increased by $765,000, or 25%, compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal
year. Product costs increased by 25% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period of the
prior fiscal year, as compared to an increase of 32% in net sales during the same period. The product costs associated with our
newest products have decreased from the prior year due to improved efficiencies in both the machine and assembly operations. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we have over-absorbed manufacturing costs of $26,000 compared to $143,000 during the
corresponding period of the prior fiscal year due to continued higher manufacturing volumes coupled with the alignment of the change
in overhead rates applied to the machine and assembly operations. Costs related to inventory and warranty charges decreased $52,000
in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2016 due primarily to $109,000 in decreased
warranty expenses offset by an increase of $57,000 in inventory charges. 

Gross profit increased
by approximately $550,000, or 52%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period of the prior
fiscal year, and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased by approximately four percentage points between such periods,
primarily as a result of the factors discussed above. 

20  

Operating Costs and Expenses    

Selling expenses consist
of salaries and other personnel-related expenses in support of business development, as well as trade show attendance, advertising
and marketing expenses, and travel and related costs incurred in generating and maintaining our customer relationships. Selling
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $52,000, or 24%, compared to the corresponding year-earlier period.
The selling expenses for our primary medical and dental business in Irvine increased by $36,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the corresponding year-earlier period, mostly due to an increase in personnel and related expenses. Offsetting
these increases was a decrease in our engineering services division ( ESD ) personnel costs of $22,000, our Fineline
division selling expenses of $25,000, primarily due to reduced commissions, our Huber division selling expenses of $11,000 and
our OMS division personnel and travel costs of $30,000. 

General and administrative
expenses ( G A ) consist of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of our accounting, finance and human
resources personnel, professional fees, directors  fees, and other costs and expenses attributable to being a public company.
G A increased by $30,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the corresponding period of the prior
fiscal year. The increase in total G A expenses was primarily related to accrued bonuses of $35,000, of which $15,000 was accrued
for our Chief Executive Officer and $20,000 was accrued for the management team. 

During the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $113,000 relating to the customer list acquired in
conjunction with our Huber acquisition, as we do not expect there to be any significant future cash flows resulting from these
customer relationships. 

Research and development
costs generally consist of compensation and other personnel related costs of our engineering and support personnel, related professional
and consulting fees, patent-related fees, lab costs, materials, and travel and related costs incurred in the development and support
of our products. Research and development costs increased approximately $47,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the corresponding prior year period. The increase is primarily due to increased severance costs of approximately $10,000, as
well as a reduction in amounts allocated to cost of sales relating to development projects, based upon the timing and number of
projects under-way in the current fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year. 

Other Income (Expense), net  

Other income and expense
consists primarily of interest expense related to the notes payable described more fully in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated
financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and did not materially vary between the quarter ended September 30, 2016
and the corresponding prior year period. 

21  

Income Tax Benefit  

The effective tax rates
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are lower than statutory tax rates due to our utilization of federal and
state loss carryforwards, with a full valuation allowance. (See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained
elsewhere in this report.) 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

Cash and cash equivalents
at September 30, 2016 decreased $126,000 to $2,168,000 as compared to $2,294,000 at June 30, 2016. The following table includes
a summary of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows contained elsewhere in this report. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by
operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $255,000. The primary sources of cash arose from
(a) the net income for the quarter of $286,000 as well as non-cash depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets
of $139,000 and $113,000, respectively, (b) a decrease of $203,000 in inventory, (c) an increase in deferred revenue of $107,000
and (d) an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent in the amount of $338,000, primarily due to a payable
related to a fixed asset purchased during the quarter. Uses of cash arose from primarily from (a) an increase of $696,000 in accounts
and other receivables and (b) an increase of $255,000 in deferred costs related to the development phase of certain contracts that
have not yet reached the billable stage under the milestone method of accounting. 

Net cash used in operating
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $641,000. The primary uses of cash arose from (a) the net
loss for the quarter of $125,000 offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $169,000, (b) an increase of $241,000 in deferred
costs related to the development phase of certain contracts that had not reached the billable stage under the completed contract
method of accounting and (c) a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent in the amount of $618,000, primarily
due to supplier payments for inventory. Sources of cash arose primarily from (a) collections of accounts and other receivables
in the amount of $118,000 and (b) a decrease in inventory in the amount of $59,000. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $326,000 and related primarily to the purchase of manufacturing equipment
in the amount of $316,000, most notably a vertical milling machine purchased to increase our throughput of sales to our largest
customer. 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $58,000 and related primarily to the extension of additional revolving
credit to Riverside Manufacturing, Inc. 

22  

Financing Activities 

Cash used in financing
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $55,000 and primarily related to the repurchase of 9,107 shares
of our common stock pursuant to the company s share repurchase program. 

Cash provided by financing
activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $495,000 and primarily related to the Fortitude Income Funds, LLC
promissory note described in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. 

Financing Facilities   Liquidity Requirements for the
next twelve months 

On September 9, 2015,
we entered a Loan and Security Agreement with Summit Financial Resources LP, (the  Summit Loan ) whereby we can borrow
up to $1.0 million against our eligible receivables, on a revolving basis, as defined in the agreement. Borrowed funds will bear
interest at a rate of prime plus 2 percent, and incur an additional administrative fee of 0.7 percent on the average outstanding
balance. The Summit Loan has an initial period of 18 months with successive one year renewal options and requires an annual facility
fee of $10,000. 

As of September 30,
2016, our working capital was $7.2 million. We currently believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well
as our account receivable balances, and the short-term borrowing capacity provided by the Summit Loan described above will provide
us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements as our business is currently conducted for at least the next 12 months.
Certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows, including but not limited to, if any of our significant customers
are unable to perform due to cancelation of their ordered products and/or their inability to pay for such products in a timely
manner. 

We are focused on preserving
our cash balances by monitoring expenses, identifying cost savings, and investing only in those development programs and products
that we believe will most likely contribute to our profitability. As we execute on our current strategy, however, we may require
debt and/or equity capital to fund our working capital needs. In particular, we have experienced, and anticipate that we may experience
in the future, negative operating cash flow, especially as we procure long-lead time materials to satisfy our current backlog.
We may attempt to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available
on acceptable terms, or we may seek working capital financing through the extension of additional credit. We cannot be certain
that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities, develop new products or otherwise
respond to competitive pressures, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE
                                         AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS
                                         AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have concluded
based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016 that our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) are effective. The
term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

23  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal controls over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed
to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.    LEGAL
                                         PROCEEDINGS  

On August 1, 2016,
we received correspondence from an attorney representing Scott Robertson, the former president of Riverside Manufacturing, Inc.,
claiming damages owed under claims of breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, wrongful self-help eviction among others. The
letter requested a payment of $250,000 within 10 days of the date of the letter to fully settle the matter. We have made no such
payment nor have we accrued any amounts related to this matter. On August 12, 2016, we responded to the letter indicating that
we believe each and every claim has no legal merit. Additionally, on September 8, 2016, we sent a follow up correspondence asserting
claims against Mr. Robertson including slander of title, fraudulent misrepresentation, conversion and theft. In October, 2016 both
parties filed a lawsuit against one another asserting the aforementioned claims. While we believe that we will prevail should this
matter go to trial, there can be no assurances that we will be successful should this matter be litigated. 

In addition to the
matter described above we are from time to time a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. There can be no
certainty, however, that we may not ultimately incur liability or that such liability will not be material and adverse.

                                         FACTORS  

Our business, future
financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of factors, risks and uncertainties, which are disclosed

2016 as well as any amendments thereto or additions and changes thereto contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
