comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the
section entitled  Risk Factors , that may cause our or our industry s actual
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially

achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the

applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not
intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
statements to actual results.  
 Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
(US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.  
 In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar
amounts are expressed in United States Dollars and all references to  common
shares  refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  
 As used in this annual report, the terms  we ,  us ,  our
company , mean Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. a Nevada corporation,  our
wholly owned subsidiaries, Alta Disposal Ltd., an Alberta, Canada corporation,
Black Box Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and our 51% owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd., an Alberta, Canada
corporation, unless otherwise indicated.  
  Corporate History   
 We were incorporated on May 31, 2006 in the State of Nevada
under the name  Mariposa Resources, Ltd. . Effective November 30, 2010, we
changed our name to  Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.,  by way of a merger with
our wholly-owned subsidiary Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., which was formed
solely for the change of name.  
 Our executive offices are located at 4635 South Lakeshore
Drive, Suite 200, Tempe Arizona, 85282-7127, and our telephone number is (480) 641-4790. We
also have an office at 840 6th Ave SW Suite 300, Calgary, Alberta T2P 3E5. The
phone number for our Calgary office is 403-930-1925.  
 On October 18, 2013, our company, through our then wholly owned
subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. (formerly 1617437 Alberta Ltd.), an Alberta,
Canada corporation, completed the acquisition of 51% of the shares of Blue Tap
Resources Inc. for total payment of CAD$466,547. As of September 30, 2013, CDN
$300,000 (US$294,908) was paid regarding the acquisition. As a result of the
share acquisition, Blue Tap Resources Inc. became a partially owned subsidiary
of our company through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. On
January 22, 2014, Blue Tap Resources Inc. changed its name to Alta Disposal
Morinville Ltd. Effective September 4, 2015, our company entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with Cancen Oil Canada whereby we sold all right, title and
interest of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. assets for total purchase price of
CAD$10,000 (approximately USD$7,531.25) . 
 On August 20, 2013, we entered into a letter of intent with
Tero Oilfield Services Ltd., a private company, pursuant to which Tero agreed to
sell up to 75% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero to our
company in exchange for payment in the amount of $1,500,000.  

On March 1, 2014, Alta Disposal Ltd., our wholly-owned
subsidiary, entered into a share purchase agreement with Tero and Garry Hofmann,
the sole shareholder of Tero. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Hofmann agreed to
sell and we agreed to purchase 50% of the issued and outstanding common shares
of Tero in exchange for an aggregate of CAD$1,000,000. As part of the share
purchase by Alta Disposal, on February 22, 2014, Tero declared a dividend in the
amount of $307,104, payable to Mr. Hofmann by way of a promissory note. As a
result of the share purchase agreement, Tero is now a partially owned (50%)
subsidiary of our company.  
 Additionally, Alta Disposal, Tero and Mr. Hofmann entered into
an option agreement entitling Alta Disposal to purchase up to an additional 25%
of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero from Mr. Hofmann exercisable
at a price of $500,000 for a period of one year. We have subsequently sold our
interest in Tero on May 1, 2015 as further described below.  
 On October 17, 2014, we amended our Articles of Incorporation,
which amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17,
2014, to increase the authorized capital of our common shares from 500,000,000
common shares, par value $0.001 to 2,000,000,000 common shares, par value
$0.001. Our authorized capital consists of 2,000,000,000 common shares and
100,000,000 preferred shares, all with a par value of $0.001.  
 On January 19, 2015, we received written consent from our
company s board of directors to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and
outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of 20 old shares of common stock
for 1 new share of common stock. Stockholders of our company originally approved
the reverse stock split on October 14, 2014 at a special meeting. The reverse
split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening
of trading on February 25, 2015. We were assigned CUSIP number 53680P209
effective February 25, 2015. Our authorized capital was not affected by the
reverse stock split.  
 On May 1, 2015, our company entered into a share purchase
agreement with an individual and disposed of our 50% interest in Tero in
consideration of $300,000.  
 On June 22, 2015, in accordance with our articles of
incorporation, our board of Directors has designated 250,000 of our 100,000,000
authorized shares of Preferred Stock as Series  A  Preferred Stock. The Series
 A  Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, will rank senior to our common stock,
carrying general voting rights with the common stock at the rate of 62 votes per
share. The Series  A  Preferred Stock will be deemed cancelled within 1 year of
issuance and are not entitled to share in dividends or other distributions. So
long as any shares of Series  A  Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
affirmative vote of not less than 75% of those outstanding shares of Series  A 
Preferred Stock will be required for any change to our Articles of
Incorporation. 
 On July 9, 2015 our board of directors approved a settlement
agreement dated June 25, 2015 among our company, JDF Capital Inc., and our
wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd. Previously, pursuant to a General
Security Agreement dated July 22, 2014, JDF Capital Inc. was granted a first
ranking security interest over all current and future assets of Alta Disposal
Ltd. in full guarantee of $708,000 loan to our Company. Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, JDF Capital Inc. and its assign, Blue Citi LLC, have
agreed to release and discharge their general security interest in consideration
of the issuance of 130,000 shares of Series  A  Preferred Stock.  
 On July 13, 2015 our company's directors approved an increase
to our authorized capital from 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 to 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share
and a reverse stock split on a basis of up to 200 old shares of common stock for
one (1) share of common stock. The increase of authorized capital and stock
split was approved by shareholders on July 13, 2015. A Definitive Schedule 14C
was filed with United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on
August 6, 2015. On September 9, 2015, we filed with the Nevada Secretary of
State a Certificate of Amendment increasing our authorized capital from  2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 to 10,000,000,000 shares
of common stock, par value of $0.001 per share. The reverse split became effective with the OTC
Markets at the opening of trading on September 30, 2015. Effective September 30,
2015, our new CUSIP number is 53680P308.  

Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any
bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any
material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a
significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.  
  Our Current Business   
 We are corporation engaged principally in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of resource properties.
 
  Disclosure Adjustments for Reverse Stock Split   
 On January 19, 2015, our board of directors consented to effect
a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a
basis of 20 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share of common stock. The
reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by the FINRA effective
February 25, 2015. Our authorized capital was not affected by the reverse stock
split.  
 On July 13, 2015, our board of directors consented to effect a

 In this Annual Report and in the accompanying audited financial
statements and notes, the above described reverse splits are reflected
retrospectively in the descriptions of shares and warrants, and their
corresponding issuance and exercise prices, except where otherwise indicated.
 
  Assignment Agreement with Lithium Exploration VIII Ltd. 
 
 On December 16, 2010, we entered into an assignment agreement
with Lithium Exploration VIII Ltd. (not related to our company) to acquire an
undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to certain mineral permits
located in the Province of Alberta, Canada. Lithium Exploration VIII and Golden
Virtue Resources Inc. (formerly First Lithium Resources Inc.) (not related to
our company) had entered into an underlying option agreement dated October 6,
2010, which option agreement and interest were assigned to our company.  
 On December 31, 2012, our company entered into an amending
agreement to amend an original payment requirement of the assignment agreement
of CAD$100,000 due on January 1, 2013 to the following payments:  
 
 The note was interest free until March 31, 2013. After March
31, 2013, interest accrued on the principal balance then in arrears at the rate
of 15% per annum. Payments were due and payable by December 31, 2013. Further,
at any time, Lithium Exploration VIII and Golden Virtue could elect to convert
the remaining balance of the note and accrued interest into common shares of our
company at 75% of the closing market price of our company s common shares on the
election day.  
 On July 3, 2013, Lithium Exploration VIII and Golden Virtue
elected to convert the note and accrued interest in the combined aggregate
amount of CAD$83,057.53 (USD$78,743) into common shares of our company. Pursuant
to this election, we issued an aggregate of 239 shares ( on a pre-reverse split
basis) of our common stock at the price of USD$330 per share.  

Glottech   
 On November 8, 2011, we entered into a letter agreement with
Glottech-USA. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we were granted an
exclusive license to use and distribute the technology within the Swan Hills
region of Alberta as well as a non-exclusive right to distribute the technology
within Canada.  
 We previously made the following payments in association with
the production of a working unit of Glottech-USA s technology:  
 
 As part of the November 8, 2011 agreement, our officer and
director, Alexander Walsh, agreed to provide Glottech-USA with the option, for a
period of 12 months from delivery of the first unit, to acquire 500 shares (of
our common stock currently held by him , for a total price of $4,000 ($1
pre-reverse splits). Additionally, if, for any reason, Mr. Walsh failed to
deliver the 500shares of our common stock to Glottech-USA, we agreed to issue
the shares from treasury.  
 On June 12, 2012, we filed a complaint against Glottech-USA in
the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania, alleging that
Glottech-USA misused our funds and was in breach of our agreements that called
for Glottech-USA to deliver one initial unit of the mechanical ultrasound
technology. We further alleged that Glottech-USA was financially insolvent and
unable to fulfill its promises to us.  
 On June 12, 2012, we filed a complaint with the Court of Common
Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania against Glottech-USA, LLC, Eldredge, Inc.,
and the Eldredge Companies, Inc. Pursuant to an unopposed motion, the Eldredge
parties were dismissed in October of 2012. The complaint initially sought an
order of the Court granting possession of the initial unit.  
 Effective August 14, 2012, we entered into an option agreement
with GD Glottech International to protect our license and distribution rights in
the event that Glottech-USA became unable to perform and honor its obligations
to us.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the option agreement, we were required
to provide an initial amount of $150,000 to be held in escrow for the option to
obtain a license on the patent rights, as set forth in the option agreement. On
September 1, 2012, Glottech-USA s license to the technology expired and also on
September 1, 2012, we exercised this option agreement and released the funds to
GD Glottech International.  
 On October 1, 2012, we entered into a license agreement and a
sales agency agreement with GD Glottech, regarding GD Glottech International s
proprietary and patented mechanical ultrasound technology for use in water
purification in the process of separation of salt and other minerals from
lithium bearing brine produced from oil and gas operations. The license
agreement and sales agency agreement expands and replaces all prior agreements
among our company, GD Glottech International and Glottech-USA, LLC regarding our
rights to use and sell the mechanical ultrasound technology, included in our
letter of intent dated November 18, 2011, and our option agreement dated August
14, 2012.  
 Pursuant to the sales agency agreement we were appointed as
sales agent for the patented mechanical ultrasound technology within Canada. Our
appointment is exclusive within the field of non petro-chemical mining and
non-exclusive in all other fields of use. In consideration of the sales agency
rights, we agreed to issue to GD Glottech International 500 common shares of our
capital stock which obligation has been satisfied through the transfer to GD
Glottech International of 500 shares held by our officer and director, Alexander
Walsh. It was the explicit intention of the parties that this share transfer
fulfills the prior obligations of Alexander Walsh and our company with respect
to the option contemplated in the March and November 2011 agreements with
Glottech-USA.  
 We will receive a royalty in respect of sales of the technology
secured by us. The term of the initial agreement will be for 5 years with the
possibility of extension if sales targets are achieved.  

Pursuant to the license agreement, we obtained the exclusive
right to use the mechanical ultrasound technology within the field of
non-petro-chemical mining within the territory of Canada. We may also sublicense
our rights under the license in respect of one or more units of the technology
to any entity operating within the field of use in which we own or beneficially
own at least a 20% equity interest. GD Glottech International agreed to supply
us with up to 5 technology units per 12-month period from the effective date of
the license term, which will start from the month of delivery of the unit of the
technology. The first unit of the technology provided under the license to be
provided at no additional cost to us and subsequent units shall be subject to a
fee based on the then current retail price of the units. If we sublicense any of
our rights, the term of the applicable license will be for 5 years from the date
the applicable unit is delivered. Pursuant to the license agreement, GD Glottech
International shall provide ongoing technical assistance and training in respect
of our use of the technology at our cost.  
 In consideration of the license, we will pay to GD Glottech
International a royalty based on the tonnage of water produced by our use of the
technology in accordance with the agreement. A minimum annual royalty will be
applicable. The term of the license agreement shall be for an initial period of
5 years and shall be renewable for additional terms of 5 years provided that we
satisfy the minimum royalty requirements during each period.  
 GD Glottech International s technology is designed to separate
suspended solids from water (brine), which is one step in the process that we
are taking to produce commercially viable minerals. The technology produces
extremely high temperatures, which destroy organic substances such as bacteria
and other toxic agents. We believe that GD Glottech International's technology
can provide lower costs of operation as well as reduced time for site clean-up
than traditional methods of water treatment. We anticipate using this
application to extract dissolved solids like lithium, potassium, and magnesium
from oil field brine. The disposal of produced water (brine) from oil and gas
production in Alberta is a significant environmental issue for the province and
presents a considerable economic issue for producers. We intend to use the
technology on our Valleyview Property in Alberta, in cooperation with oil and
gas producers, to treat and dispose of their produced water while monetizing the
minerals that are contained within that produced water stream that is being
brought to the surface during the oil and gas production process. As we owned the
MAIM (Metals and Industrial Minerals) claims to the minerals on the Valleyview
Property, the minerals contained in their produced water stream fall under our
rights. While we have had discussions with oil and gas consultants and oil
operators regarding their difficulties in treating the brine at some of their
fields, we have no formal agreements in place.  
 The technical process is based on the use of mechanical
ultrasound generated through the production of a series of cavitations.
Mechanical ultrasound is a machine-produced sound of a frequency above the upper
limit of the normal range of human hearing. Cavitations are the rapid formation
and collapse of bubbles in liquids, caused by the movement of something such as
a propeller or by waves of high-frequency sound. The production of mechanical
ultrasound allows GD Glottech International s technology to distill the fluid
stock. Using mechanical ultrasound for distillation has been attempted before,
but the external energy requirement needed to produce the mechanical ultrasound
was far too expensive to make it commercially viable. GD Glottech
International s technology uses the energy released during the cavitations in
order to make it commercially viable from an economic perspective. During these
cavitations, a millisecond of energy is released. During this release,
temperatures can reach 5,000 degrees centigrade.  
 On August 27, 2012, we filed a motion to amend our complaint to
include claims of breach of trust and fiduciary duty, breach of good faith and
fair dealing, breach of contract, conversion of funds, fraud, and the imposition
of a constructive trust. We believe that this action was necessary to protect
our interests against possible misuse of funds by Glottech-USA, LLC and its
principals. We will also seek damages as appropriate.  
 On October 19, 2012, GD Glottech International moved to
intervene as an interested party in the litigation pending against Glottech-USA.
GD Glottech International cited its role as owner of the patents as a basis for
intervening in the litigation against Glottech-USA. We believe GD Glottech
International s entry into the litigation against Glottech-USA is favorable to
our cause in the litigation.  
 On October 22, 2012, the Court of Common Pleas in Chester
County, Pennsylvania, granted our motion to amend our complaint against
Glottech-USA to add claims for fraud and damages reflective of the malfeasance
which we allege against Glottech-USA and its officers.  

On December 12, 2012, GD Glottech International removed the
management of Glottech-USA and appointed itself as the manager of Glottech-USA.
On the same day, Larry Nesbit, Mark Siegel and Ron Fender filed a motion to
dissolve Glottech-USA in Mississippi on the basis that Glottech-USA was unable
to meet its financial obligations and could not finish or deliver the unit to
us.  
 On December 19, 2012, an attorney purportedly acting on behalf
of Glottech-USA filed a motion in the lawsuit pending in Chester County,
Pennsylvania, seeking possession of the unit. In addition, Glottech-USA filed a
counterclaim seeking possession of the unit.  
 GD Glottech International immediately filed a motion to quash
Glottech-USA s motion and for sanctions against the law firm that filed the
motion. We also filed a motion, seeking disqualification of the law firm that
purported to represent Glottech-USA on the basis that the new management for
Glottech-USA had fired the law firm and, as such, the law firm no longer had
authority to represent Glottech-USA.  
 On April 25, 2013, we attended a hearing on the motions pending
in the lawsuit filed in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The Court did not rule on
any of the motions and, instead, stayed the case as to Glottech-USA until
December of 2013 pending the outcome of the lawsuit seeking dissolution of
Glottech-USA. The matter in Pennsylvania is no longer stayed. An attorney
purporting to represent Glottech-USA and the receiver appointed in Mississippi
has filed motions and other documents that may move the matter forward. We have
pending preliminary objections to the counterclaim, including a request for a
determination of which group is in control of Glottech-USA.  
 Certain members of Glottech-USA continue to pursue dissolution
of the company in Mississippi. The members of Glottech-USA who seek dissolution
have stated in court filings that it is not practicable for Glottech-USA to
continue as an ongoing business. In addition, Sulzer filed suit against
Glottech-USA Texas for unfulfilled obligations.  
 We do not believe that Glottech-USA has sufficient capital to
continue as an ongoing business. We have provided full consideration to
Glottech-USA and complied with all other agreed upon terms. We believe any
assertions against us to lack merit.  
 Given pending litigation against Glottech-USA, and the
uncertainties naturally inherent of any litigation (particularly as to outcome
and timing thereof), we have moved to assure continuity of our licensing rights
through entering into, and exercising, the option to contract directly with the
technology inventor and patents owner, GD Glottech International. Thus,
regardless of the outcome of the litigation, or indeed any action or inaction of
Glottech-USA, our interest in the technology is assured.  
 On December 18, 2015 we withdrew our complaint against
Glottech-USA, LLC filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Chester County,
Pennsylvania. Concurrently, we released Glottech  USA, LLC and its former
principals, Mark Seigel, Larry Nesbit and Ron Fender, from any and all claims
related to the complaint.  
 Subsequent to the litigation in Pennsylvania, Glottech-USA
initiated a legal action for dissolution in Mississippi. The Company was not a
party to the dissolution action in Mississippi. A court-appointed receiver for
Glottech-USA recently approved a previously proposed settlement. The settlement
has been recently approved by the court in Mississippi. The Company believes
that the litigation in Pennsylvania produced positive outcomes that resulted in
the Company's current relationship with the inventors and owners of the
technology previously licensed to Gottech-USA. 
  Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. Acquisition   
 On June 11, 2013, we entered into a letter of intent with Alta
Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Blue Tap Resources Inc.) pursuant to which we
agreed to acquire not less than 51% of the outstanding securities of Alta
Disposal Morinville in consideration of an aggregate investment of $450,000 in
Alta Disposal Morinville s waste water disposal facility located in Morinville,
Alberta. The closing of the transaction was subject to a number of conditions
precedent, including but not limited to completion of due diligence and the
negotiation of a definitive long form agreement.  
 On July 29, 2013, in anticipation of the completion of a formal
agreement with Alta Disposal Morinville embodying the terms of the letter of
intent, we entered into a convertible debenture agreement with Alta Disposal
Morinville pursuant to which we agreed to deliver to Alta Disposal Morinville up
to CAD$300,000 (approximately USD$291,000) payable in two installments of
CAD$150,000 deliverable respectively upon execution of the convertible
debenture, and within 5 business days following receipt of regulatory approval
for the re-activation of Alta Disposal Morinville s waste water disposal
facility. Delivery of the first and second installments totaling CAD$300,000
have been satisfied and the acquisition was finalized as of October 18, 2013.
The funds advanced are secured against all present and future assets and undertakings of Alta Disposal Morinville and are convertible at
our option into a number of common shares of Alta Disposal Morinville equal to
51% of its issued and outstanding voting stock.  

Effective August 1, 2013, we entered into a joint venture
agreement with Alta Disposal Morinville pursuant to which our company and Alta
Disposal Morinville will operate certain lands and facilities including a
disposal well in the Morinville area of Alberta.  
 On October 18, 2013, we completed the acquisition of 51% of the
outstanding securities of Alta Disposal Morinville, pursuant to a letter of
intent with Alta Disposal Morinville dated June 11, 2013. As a result of the
share acquisition, Alta Disposal Morinville is now a partially owned subsidiary
of our company through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd.  
 In accordance with the letter of intent, we acquired, through
our wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd., 51% of the outstanding
securities of Alta Disposal Morinville (being 510,000 common shares) in
consideration of an aggregate investment of CDN$466,547 (approximately
USD$453,204) in Alta Disposal Morinville s waste water disposal facility located
in Morinville, Alberta, where Alta Disposal Morinville holds a 100% working
interest in 17 freehold mineral leases. There are currently two standing natural
gas wells and one disposal well located on the leases, including water disposal
facilities, tanks and equipment. Payment of an initial CDN$300,000 (USD$291,000)
of the CDN$466,547 aggregate investment was made pursuant to a secured
convertible debenture which has been fully converted into common shares of Alta
Disposal Morinville. The Alta Disposal Morinville leases are subject to a 3%
gross overriding royalty held by Mr. Vincent Murphy pursuant to a gross
overriding royalty agreement dated June 30, 2013. The royalty is payable on all
fluids separated, treated, or otherwise enhanced for sale on the lease property.
 
 The acquisition of Alta Disposal Morinville was completed
through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Ltd., which was formed in the
Province of Alberta for the primary purpose of the transaction with Alta
Disposal Morinville. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, Alta
Disposal entered into a unanimous shareholders and management agreement (the
 Shareholders Agreement ) dated October 18, 2013 with Excel Petroleum Ltd.
(which holds 49% of Alta Disposal Morinville) and Alta Disposal Morinville
itself.  
 Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, Alta Disposal may
continue to fund the current capital requirements of Alta Disposal Morinville up
to an aggregate of $420,000 in consideration of additional shares of Alta
Disposal Morinville at the rate of 163,250 shares (equivalent to approximately
5% of Alta Disposal Morinville s common shares on a diluted basis) for each
$105,000 funded until Alta Disposal holds an aggregate of 70% of Alta Disposal
Morinville s outstanding common shares. If Alta Disposal elects to fund the
on-going capital requirements of Alta Disposal Morinville beyond the aggregate
of $870,000, any such funds advanced by Alta Disposal will be deemed to be funds
loaned by Alta Disposal to Alta Disposal Morinville on a non-interest bearing,
unsecured bridge loan basis.  
 Any such funds provided to Alta Disposal Morinville will be
repayable from cash flow generated by Alta Disposal Morinville. Funds loaned
prior to June 30, 2014 will not be due and payable until June 30, 2014 and
thereafter will not be due and payable until at least 6 months following the
date of any such loan.  
 Other terms of the Shareholders Agreement include:  

the board of directors of Alta Disposal Morinville will
      consist of 3 directors including 2 nominees of Alta Disposal and 1 nominee
      of Excel.    

Alexander Walsh will serve as chairman of the board of
      directors, president and chief executive officer of Alta Disposal
      Morinville.    

Approval of the shareholders holding not less than 60% of
      Alta Disposal Morinville shares will be required to remove or appoint
      officers of Alta Disposal Morinville.    

Unanimous approval of the shareholders will be required
      in order to (i) effect capital alterations; (ii) declare dividends except
      following the completion of a fiscal year end and on a pro-rata basis to
      all shareholders; or (iii) wind-up; dissolve; or reorganize the
      corporation or sell or lease substantially all of its assets.    

Alta Disposal will otherwise have sole discretion and
      authority in respect of any and all management and operational decisions
      relating to the corporation.     

Each shareholder of Alta Disposal Morinville will have a
      right of first refusal to purchase all shares sought to be sold by the
      other shareholder.    

Customary restrictions on the encumbrance and disposition
      of shares.     

 The Shareholders Agreement additionally provides for the
engagement of Valeura Energy Inc. as the operator of Alta Disposal Morinville s
lands, wells, the facilities, pipelines and disposal wells pursuant to an
operating agreement between Alta Disposal Morinville and Valeura dated July 9,
2013. Valeura was to retain a 10% working interest in Alta Disposal Morinville s
lands until completion of the initial work on the disposal well project and will
re-convey that interest to Alta Disposal Morinville provided that Alta Disposal
Morinville has paid Valeura a cash payment of $2,500 per month for acting as
operator of the disposal well and the lands and upon payment of an amount of
$10,000 to Valeura upon completion of the project. The disposal well work
program must be mutually approved by Alta Disposal Morinville and Valeura. Alta
Disposal Morinville will be responsible for all costs and expenses relating to
the work program.  
 Effective September 4, 2015, our company entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with Cancen Oil Canada whereby we sold all right, title and
interest of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. assets for total purchase price of
CAD$10,000 (approximately USD$7,531.25). 
  Tero Oilfield Services Ltd. Acquisition (and
Disposition)   
 On August 20, 2013, we entered into a letter of intent with
Tero Oilfield Services Ltd., a private company, pursuant to which Tero agreed to
sell up to 75% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero to our
company in exchange for payment in the amount of $1,500,000.  
 On March 1, 2014, Alta Disposal Ltd., our wholly-owned
subsidiary, entered into a share purchase agreement with Tero and Garry Hofmann,
the sole shareholder of Tero. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Hofmann agreed to
sell and we agreed to purchase 50% of the issued and outstanding common shares
of Tero (the  Tero Shares ) in exchange for an aggregate of CAD$1,000,000. As
part of the share purchase by Alta Disposal, on February 22, 2014, Tero declared
a dividend in the amount of $307,104, payable to Mr. Hofmann by way of a
promissory note.  
 Additionally, Alta Disposal, Tero and Mr. Hofmann entered into
an option agreement entitling Alta Disposal to purchase up to an additional 25%
of the issued and outstanding common shares of Tero from Mr. Hofmann exercisable
at a price of $500,000 for a period of one year.  
 Lastly, Alta Disposal, Tero and Mr. Hofmann entered into a
shareholders  agreement concerning any potential financing by the shareholders
of Tero for the benefit of Tero s operations. This agreement provides that the
shareholders of Tero, Alta Disposal and Mr. Hofmann, may by unanimous resolution
advance to Tero, upon demand by Tero, such funds as may be determined specified
by unanimous resolution, subject to the agreement.  
 Tero was a family owned waste disposal company. The waste
disposal facility had been under the same ownership since it began operations in
1997. In 2002, Tero successfully reclassified the original Class II well to a
Class IB disposal well and expanded the capabilities of the facility to handle
solid waste disposal. The facility is located near Wardlow, Alberta and is right
in the heart of the area's oil and gas producers. The nearest competing
commercial disposal companies are 75 kilometers away which presents Tero s
facility with a large geographical advantage.  
 On September 15, 2014, Northern Hunter Energy Inc. entered into
a conveyance agreement with Tero dated June 1, 2014. Pursuant to this agreement,
Northern Hunter Energy will transfer a 10% working interest in certain assets of
the Morinville, Alberta property, which was previously acquired from Valeura, to
Tero effective June 1, 2014 for the sum of $10,000. As of the date of this
report, the transfer has not been completed and the sum of $10,000 has not been
paid.  
 On May 1, 2015, Alta Disposal entered into a share purchase
agreement with Natel Hofmann and Tero Oilfield Services Ltd. for the sale of the
Tero Shares by Alta Disposal to Ms. Hofmann in consideration of an aggregate of
$300,000. As at April 29, 2015, the purchase price was paid in full.  

Loans of Our Company   
 Since March 2014, our company has received various loans from
unrelated third party that are listed below. These loans are convertible into
shares of our company pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements. In the
descriptions below of the loans, the issuance of common shares pursuant to the
conversion of debt pursuant to convertible promissory notes, and the issuance of
common shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants, transactions are a on a post
reverse stock split basis. These adjustments include our first reverse share
split approved on January 19, 2015 (20 old shares of common stock for one (1)
new share of common stock), and our second reverse stock split approved by our
board of directors on July 13, 2015 (200 old shares of common stock for one (1)
new share of common stock). All the loans, convertible promissory notes, and
warrants include terms that make them subject to the share splits.  
  Loan Agreements with JDF Capital Inc.   
   $500,000 Loan from JDF Capital   
 On March 15, 2014, we entered into a securities purchase
agreement with JDF, pursuant to which JDF provided us with an aggregate
investment of $500,000 in consideration of our issuance of convertible
promissory notes and common share purchase warrants. We issued JDF a 10%
original issue discount convertible promissory note of $550,000 due September
15, 2015 and convertible into common shares on a cashless basis at a price per
share of 35% of the lower of lowest closing bid price of our common shares
during the prior 20 trading days prior to 1) the date of the purchase agreement
or 2) the day of the notice for conversion. The note bears interest, in arrears,
at a rate per annum equal to fifteen percent (15%) accruing on a semi-annual
basis commencing March 15, 2014 in cash or restricted shares of our company s
common stock, par value $0.001 per share at the option of the holder. The fair
value of the note at issuance was $846,154. During the year ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, an interest expense of $Nil and $6,279 respectively, was accrued in
respect of the note.  
 In addition on March 15, 2014, we issued an aggregate of 4,583
warrants to JDF in consideration for purchasing the note. Subject to
adjustments, these warrants were convertible into common shares at a price of
$240.00 and expire after a term of three years. In the case that after six
months there is no registration statement available for the resale of our common
shares from exercising of these warrants, the warrants may be exercised on a
cashless basis at a price as set out in the warrant. These warrants were
cancelled on September 19, 2016 in consideration for the issuance of a
convertible promissory note pursuant to an Exchange Agreement with JDF Capital
Inc. dated September 19, 2016. 
 Pursuant to a partial sale and assignment agreement dated
February 27, 2015 among our company, JDF Capital Inc. and River North Equity,
LLC, JDF Capital assigned $100,000 portion of the March 15, 2014 note to River
North Equity.  
 On March 30, 2015, our directors approved an amendment to the
note. We amended and restated a $50,000 portion of the $550,000 note, into a new
promissory note to LG Capital Funding LLC, in the amount of $50,000 to provide
conversion features equal to 50% of the lowest closing price of the last 20
trading days prior to conversion, as well as 10% per annum interest and become
due and payable one year after the issuance date.  
 The $400,000 portion of the March 15, 2014 convertible
promissory note held by JDF Capital has been fully converted into shares of our
common stock.  
 To date, we have issued the following securities in conversion
of the $100,000 portion of the March 15, 2014 convertible promissory note held
by River North Equity:  

On November 11, 2015 the balance note of $6,639 along with
interest of $5,681 totaling to $12,320 was assigned to VES Trust whereas all of
the accompanying warrants remain unconverted and outstanding.  
 On March 3, 2015, JDF Capital, LG Capital Funding, LLC and our
company agreed to assign an aggregate of $50,000 from the note of JDF Capital to
LG Capital and to amend the conversion price to equal to 50% of the lowest
closing price of the our common stock for the last 20 trading days prior to
conversion, as well as 10% per annum interest. The terms of this note were not
amended in the assignment. As at the date of this report, we have made the
following issuances of common stock in conversion of this convertible note:  
 
 As at the date of this report, there remains no balance
payable pursuant to the note.  
   $200,000 Loan        from JDF Capital   
 On March 3, 2014, we entered into a securities purchase
agreement with JDF Capital, Inc., pursuant to which JDF Capital agreed to
provide us with an aggregate investment of $220,000 in consideration of our
issuance of convertible promissory notes and common share purchase warrants.
 
 On March 3, 2014, JDF Capital funded an aggregate investment of
$200,000 to us. Therefore, we issued JDF Capital an original issue discount 10%
convertible promissory note of $220,000 due September 3, 2014 and convertible
into common shares on a cashless basis at a price per share of 50% of the lower
of lowest closing bid price of our common shares during the prior 20 trading
days prior to 1) the date of the purchase agreement or 2) the day of the notice
for conversion. The convertible note was later assigned to Blue Citi, LLC on
March 19, 2014. 

During the year ended June 30, 2015, $220,000 (June 30, 2014 -

 On September 19, 2016 we entered into an Exchange Agreement
with JDF Capital Inc. pursuant to which we issued to JDF Capital a convertible
promissory note with a face value of $140,000 in consideration for the
cancellation of 700 share purchase warrants issued to JDF Capital on
March 3, 2014. The cancelled warrants were exercisable on a cashless basis and
had a fair value of approximately $140,000 upon cancellation. The convertible
promissory note has a maturity dated of September 19, 2017, bears interest of 8%
per year, and is convertible at a price equal to 65% of the lowest closing bid
price of our common stock occurring during the twenty trading days immediately
preceding September 19, 2016, or immediately preceding the notice of conversion.  
   $600,000 Loan     from JDF Capital   
 On August 6, 2014, we entered into a securities purchase
agreement with JDF dated July 22, 2014 pursuant to which we issued to JDF a
convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $708,000, which
amount includes the purchase price of $600,000 plus 18 months prepaid interest
at the rate of 12% per annum. The convertible note has a maturity date of
January 22, 2016 and is convertible in whole or in part into shares of our
common stock at price per share equal to 65% of the lowest reported sale price
of our common shares during the 20 trading days prior to July 22, 2014 ($160.00)
or prior to the applicable conversion date. Our company will have the option to
prepay the note within 60 days subject to a 10% penalty, within the subsequent
60 days subject to a 20% penalty, or anytime thereafter prior to maturity
subject to a 30% penalty. The purchase price of the promissory note is payable
in six installments beginning upon the effective date of the agreement (which
amount has been paid) and monthly thereafter beginning on August 22, 2014. The
promissory note is secured in first position against all assets of our

Competition   
 The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are
a new exploration-stage company and have a weak competitive position in the
industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies,
independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are
actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world
together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those
properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is
intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a
competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information
or expertise available to other bidders.  
 Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete
for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have
greater financial and technical resources than those available to us.
Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring
mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their
mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to
acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to
prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and
development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the
financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or
explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.  
 We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies
for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in
such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies
may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our
acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in
our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral
exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition,
we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for
available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists,
land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral
exploration supplies and drill rigs.  
 General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by
various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to
time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as
factors beyond our control, including international political conditions,
overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.  
 In the face of competition, we may not be successful in
acquiring, exploring or developing profitable mineral properties or interests,
and we cannot give any assurance that suitable oil and gas properties or
interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development.
Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the mineral exploration
industry by:  

keeping our costs low;   

relying on the strength of our management s
      contacts; and   

using our size and experience to our advantage
      by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to
      potential opportunities.    

  Intellectual Property   
 We own the trademark  Lithium Exploration Group  for the use of
mining exploration, namely, lithium exploration services, in class 42 (U.S. CLS.
100 and 101). The registration number is 4,075,565 and was registered on
December 20, 2011. We do not have any other intellectual property.  
  Government Regulation   
 Any operations at our Lithium properties will be subject to
various federal and state laws and regulations in Canada which govern
prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards,
occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety,
hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those
licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct
exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions
relating to us or to our lithium properties with respect to the foregoing laws
and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface
impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface
impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including
rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife
and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable
regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such
compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with
exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties.
We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints
affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or
operation of property in Canada.  

Environmental Regulations   
 We are not aware of any material violations of environmental
permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our
operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any
material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or
other requirements.  
 While our intended projects and business activities do not
currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional
restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely
affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our
products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.  
  Employees   
 We currently employ two individuals: Alexander Walsh as chief
executive officer, and Shanon Chilson as an administrative assistant and
controller. Outside consultants have been engaged for administrative duties and
industry specialties.  
  Research and Development   
 We have not spent any amounts which have been classified as
research and development activities in our financial statements during the last
two fiscal years.  
  Going Concern   
 We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the
form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we
cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our
directors to exit the exploration phase of our company and reach development and
revenue. We do not have enough cash on hand to meet our obligations over the
next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future
equity financing.  
  Subsidiaries   
 We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alta Disposal Ltd. and Black Box Energy, Inc., and a 51% owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd.  Alta Disposal Ltd., was incorporated in the province of Alberta, Canada on July 8, 2011. This subsidiary was formed to stake MAIM (Metallic and Industrial Mineral) rights in Alberta which subsequently lapsed or were sold. Black Box Energy, Inc. was incorporated on September 9, 2016 in the State of Nevada for the purposes of acquiring a 50% working interest in the McKean County Project.  Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Blue Tap Resources, Inc.) is an Alberta, Canada corporation, In September 4, 2015 we sold substantially all of the assets, business and undertaking of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd.

Item 1A.   
      Risk Factors     
 Much of the information included in this annual report includes
or is based upon estimates, projections or other  forward-looking statements. 
Such forward-looking statements include any projections and estimates made by us
and by our management in connection with our business operations. While these
forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are
made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of
our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from
any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance
suggested herein.  
 Such estimates, projections or other  forward-looking
statements  involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We
caution the reader that important factors in some cases have affected and, in
the future, could materially affect actual results and cause actual results to
differ materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections
or other  forward-looking statements.   
  Risks Related to Our Business   
  We have a limited operating history and as a result there is
no assurance we can operate on a profitable basis.   
 We have a limited operating history. Our company's operations
will be subject to all the uncertainties arising from the absence of a
significant operating history. Potential investors should be aware of the
difficulties normally encountered by resource exploration companies and the high
rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be
considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and
delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the properties that we
plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to,
unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and
expenses that may exceed current estimates. The expenditures to be made by us in
the exploration of our properties may not result in the discovery of reserves.
Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations of rock or land and other
conditions are involved in resource exploration and often result in unsuccessful
exploration efforts. If the results of our exploration do not reveal viable
commercial reserves, we may decide to abandon our claims and acquire new claims
for new exploration or cease operations. The acquisition of additional claims
will be dependent upon us possessing capital resources at the time in order to
purchase such claims. If no funding is available, we may be forced to abandon
our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate on a
profitable basis.  
  If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will
fail and our investors could lose their investment.   
 We had cash in the amount of $25,208 and working capital
deficiency (current liabilities exceeding current assets) of $2,473,600 as of
the year ended June 30, 2016. We currently do not generate much revenue from our
operations. Any direct acquisition of a claim under lease or option is subject
to our ability to obtain the financing necessary for us to fund and carry out
exploration programs on potential properties. The requirements are substantial.
Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors,
including market prices for resources, investor acceptance of our properties and
investor sentiment. These factors may negatively affect the timing, amount,
terms or conditions of any additional financing available to us. The most likely
source of future funds presently available to us is through the sale of equity
capital and loans. Any sale of share capital will result in dilution to existing
shareholders.  
  Because of the speculative nature of exploration of mineral
properties, we may never discover a commercially exploitable quantity of
minerals, our business may fail and investors may lose their entire
investment.   

We are in the very early exploration stage and cannot guarantee
that our exploration work will be successful, or that any minerals will be
found, or that any production of minerals will be realized. The search for
valuable minerals as a business is extremely risky. Substantial investment will
be required to move our company toward the production of minerals. This may
require bringing in a partner to make the necessary investment, but there are no
plans at this time for any form of partnership or merger. We can provide
investors with no assurance that exploration on our properties will establish
that commercially exploitable reserves of minerals exist on our property.
Additional potential problems that may prevent us from discovering any reserves
of minerals on our property include, but are not limited to, unanticipated
problems relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may
exceed current estimates. If we are unable to establish the presence of
commercially exploitable reserves of minerals on our property, our ability to
fund future exploration activities will be impeded, we will not be able to
operate profitably and investors may lose all of their investment in our
company.  
  We have no known mineral reserves and we may not find any
lithium and, even if we find lithium, it may not be in economic quantities. If
we fail to find any lithium or if we are unable to find lithium in economic
quantities, we will have to suspend operations.   
 We have no known mineral reserves. Additionally, even if we
find lithium in sufficient quantity to warrant recovery, it ultimately may not
be recoverable. Finally, even if any lithium is recoverable, we do not know that
this can be done at a profit. Failure to locate lithium in economically
recoverable quantities will cause us to suspend operations.  
  Supplies needed for exploration may not always be available.
If we are unable to secure exploration supplies we may have to delay our
anticipated business operations.   
 Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies needed
for our proposed exploration work could result in occasional spot shortages of
supplies of certain products, equipment or materials. There is no guarantee we
will be able to obtain certain products, equipment and/or materials as and when
needed, without interruption, or on favorable terms. Such delays could affect
our anticipated business operations and increase our expenses.  
  Because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties
inherent in mineral exploration ventures, we face a high risk of business
failure.   
 Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties
normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of
failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in
light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we
plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to,
unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and
expenses that may exceed current estimates. The expenditures to be made by us in
the exploration of the mineral claim may not result in the discovery of mineral
deposits. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions
are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration
efforts. If the results of our exploration do not reveal viable commercial
mineralization, we may decide to abandon our claims. If this happens, our
business will likely fail.  
  The marketability of natural resources will be affected by
numerous factors beyond our control, which may result in us not receiving an
adequate return on invested capital to be profitable or viable.   
 The marketability of natural resources, which may be acquired
or discovered by us, will be affected by numerous factors beyond our control.
These factors include market fluctuations in lithium pricing and demand, the
proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment,
governmental regulations, land tenure, land use, regulation concerning the
importing and exporting of mineral resources and environmental protection
regulations. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,
but the combination of these factors may result in us not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital to be profitable or viable.  
  Exploration and production activities are subject to certain
environmental regulations, which may prevent or delay the commencement or
continuation of our operations.   

In general, our exploration and production activities are
subject to certain federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to
environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase
the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or
continuation of a given operation. Specifically, we may be subject to
legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges and
storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been
enacted which requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to
the satisfaction of state authorities. However, such laws and regulations are
frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
Generally, environmental requirements do not appear to affect us any differently
or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry.  
  Any change to government regulation/administrative practices
may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability. 
 
 The business of mineral exploration and development is subject
to substantial regulation under various countries  laws relating to the
exploration for, and the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation,
and transportation of mineral resources and related products and other matters.
Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities
of mineral exploration and development operations could have a material adverse
impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax
laws, royalty regulations and government incentive programs related to the
properties and the mineral exploration industry generally will not be changed in
a manner which may adversely affect our progress and cause delays, inability to
explore and develop or abandonment of these interests.  
 Permits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a
variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of exploration and
development. There can be no assurance that the various government permits,
leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our
activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiry.
There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will
not contain terms and provisions, which may adversely affect our exploration and
development activities.  
  If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, we may
not be able to implement our business plan.   
 Our success is largely dependent on our ability to hire highly
qualified personnel. This is particularly true in highly technical businesses
such as resource exploration. These individuals are in high demand and we may
not be able to attract the personnel we need. In addition, we may not be able to
afford the high salaries and fees demanded by qualified personnel, or may lose
such employees after they are hired. Failure to hire key personnel when needed,
or on acceptable terms, would have a significant negative effect on our
business.  
  Our independent certified public accounting firm, in their
report on the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016,
states that there is a substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a
going concern.   
 As of June 30, 2016, we have experienced significant losses
since inception. Failure to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms and
to achieve profitability would have an adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Accordingly, there is
substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.  
  Risks Relating to the Industry in General   
  Planned exploration, and if warranted, development and
mining activities involve a high degree of risk.   
 We cannot assure you of the success of our planned operations.
Exploration costs are not fixed, and resources cannot be reliably identified
until substantial development has taken place, which entails high exploration
and development costs. The costs of mining, processing, development and
exploitation activities are subject to numerous variables, which could result in
substantial cost overruns. Mining for base or precious metals may involve
unprofitable efforts, not only from dry properties, but from properties that are
productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after
accounting for mining, operating and other costs.  

Our operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a
result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including
economic conditions, mechanical problems, title problems, weather conditions,
compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays of equipment
and services.  
 We do not insure against all risks associated with our business
because insurance is either unavailable or its cost of coverage is prohibitive.
The occurrence of an event that is not covered by insurance could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition.  
  The impact of government regulation could adversely affect
our business.   
 Our business is subject to applicable domestic and foreign laws
and regulations, including laws and regulations on taxation, exploration, and
environmental and safety matters. Many laws and regulations govern the spacing
of mines, rates of production, prevention of waste and other matters. These laws
and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing,
drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our mines and other facilities.
In addition, our operations are subject to complex environmental laws and
regulations adopted by domestic and foreign jurisdictions where we operate. We
could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge
of pollutants into the air, soil or water, including responsibility for remedial
costs.  
  The submission and approval of environmental impact
assessments may be required.   
 Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which means
stricter standards; enforcement, fines and penalties for noncompliance are more
stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened
degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees.
The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations has a potential
to reduce the profitability of operations.  
 Because the requirements imposed by these laws and regulations
frequently change, we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the
future, including changes to existing laws and regulations, will not adversely
affect our business.  
  Decline in mineral prices may make it commercially
infeasible for us to develop our property and may cause our stock price to
decline.   
 The value and price of your investment in our common shares,
our financial results, and our exploration, development and mining activities
may be significantly adversely affected by declines in the price of minerals and
other precious metals. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by
numerous factors beyond our control, such as interest rates, exchange rates,
inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and
foreign currencies, global and regional supply and demand, and the political and
economic conditions of mineral-producing countries throughout the world. The
price of minerals fluctuates in response to many factors, which are beyond
anyone s prediction abilities. The prices used in making the estimates in our
plans differ from daily prices quoted in the news media. Because mining occurs
over a number of years, it may be prudent to continue mining for some periods
during which cash flows are temporarily negative for a variety of reasons. Such
reasons include a belief that the low price is temporary, and/or the expense
incurred is greater when permanently closing a mine.  
  We may not have access to all of the supplies and materials
we need to begin exploration, which could cause us to delay or suspend
operations.   
 Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the
industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies such as dynamite
as well as certain equipment like bulldozers and excavators that we might need
to conduct exploration. If we cannot obtain the necessary supplies, we will have
to suspend our exploration plans until we do obtain such supplies.  

Risks Associated with Our Common Stock   
  Trading on the OTC Markets may be volatile and sporadic,
which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult
for our stockholders to resell their shares.   
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the electronic
quotation system operated by OTC Markets . Trading in stock quoted on the OTC
Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices,
due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business
prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock
for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not
a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more
sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ
or a stock exchange like NYSE or Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have
difficulty reselling any of the shares.  
  Penny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders
to sell their stock.   
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations
which generally define  penny stock  to be any equity security that has a market
price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than
$5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by
the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on
broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and
 accredited investors.  The term  accredited investor  refers generally to
institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth
in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly
with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a
transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the
nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must
provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock,
the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in
the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and
salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in
writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in
writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt
from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination
that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary
market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently,
these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our
securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest
in and limit the marketability of our common stock.  
  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has
adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a shareholder's ability
to buy and sell our stock.   
 In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has
adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a
broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is
suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status,
tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative, low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some
customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to
recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your
ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for
its shares.  
  We do not intend to pay dividends and there will thus be
fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment.   
 We have never paid dividends and do not intend to pay any
dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we may require
additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding
sources may prohibit the declaration of dividends. Because we do not intend to
pay dividends, any gain on your investment will need to result from an
appreciation in the price of our common stock. There will therefore be fewer
ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment.  

Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice
requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks, some brokers may be
unwilling to trade our securities. This means that you may have difficulty
reselling your shares, which may cause the value of your investment to
decline.   
 Our shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by
Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) which
imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers-dealers who sell our
securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our securities,
broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a
written agreement from you prior to making a sale on your behalf. Because of the
imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that
broker-dealers will not want to make a market in our common stock. This could
prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your
investment to decline.  
  Other Risks   
  Trends, Risks and Uncertainties   
 We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most
significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what
extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have
identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully
consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with
respect to our common stock.

Item 2.   
      Properties     
 On May 25, 2016 we entered into a lease agreement with
Lakeshore Investment Group II, LLC to lease the premises of our executive

The lease is for a period of 12 months beginning June 1, 2016 for a monthly rate
of $1,198.67, inclusive of internet and utilities.  
 We also currently rent an office at a business center at 840
6th Avenue SW, Suite 300, Calgary, AB T2P 3E5 for $998 a month on a month to
month basis. Our telephone number in Scottsdale is (480) 641-4790. Our telephone
number in Calgary is (403) 930-1925.  

Item 3.   
      Legal Proceedings     
 Other than as set out below, we know of no material, existing
or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in
any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which
any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial
shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our
company.  
 On June 12, 2012, we filed a complaint against Glottech-USA in
the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania, alleging that
Glottech-USA misused our funds and was in breach of our agreements that called
for Glottech-USA to deliver one initial unit of the mechanical ultrasound
technology. We further alleged that Glottech-USA was financially insolvent and
unable to fulfill its promises to us.  
 On June 12, 2012, we filed a complaint with the Court of Common
Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania against Glottech-USA, LLC, Eldredge, Inc.,
and the Eldredge Companies, Inc. Pursuant to an unopposed motion, the Eldredge
parties were dismissed in October of 2012. The complaint initially sought an
order of the Court granting possession of the initial unit.  
 Effective August 14, 2012, we entered into an option agreement
with GD Glottech International to protect our license and distribution rights in
the event that Glottech-USA became unable to perform and honor its obligations
to us.  

Pursuant to the terms of the option agreement, we were required
to provide an initial amount of $150,000 to be held in escrow for the option to
obtain a license on the patent rights, as set forth in the option agreement. On
September 1, 2012, Glottech-USA s license to the technology expired and also on
September 1, 2012, we exercised this option agreement and released the funds to
GD Glottech International.  
 On October 1, 2012, we entered into a license agreement and a
sales agency agreement with GD Glottech, regarding GD Glottech International s
proprietary and patented mechanical ultrasound technology for use in water
purification in the process of separation of salt and other minerals from
lithium bearing brine produced from oil and gas operations. The license
agreement and sales agency agreement expands and replaces all prior agreements
among our company, GD Glottech International and Glottech-USA, LLC regarding our
rights to use and sell the mechanical ultrasound technology, included in our
letter of intent dated November 18, 2011, and our option agreement dated August
14, 2012.  
 Pursuant to the sales agency agreement we were appointed as
sales agent for the patented mechanical ultrasound technology within Canada. Our
appointment is exclusive within the field of non petro-chemical mining and
non-exclusive in all other fields of use. In consideration of the sales agency
rights, we agreed to issue to GD Glottech International 500 (adjusted for
subsequent reverse stock splits) common shares of our capital stock, which
obligation has been satisfied through the transfer to GD Glottech International
of 500 (adjusted for subsequent reverse stock splits) shares held by our officer
and director, Alexander Walsh. It was the explicit intention of the parties that
this share transfer fulfills the prior obligations of Alexander Walsh and our
company with respect to the option contemplated in the March and November 2011
agreements with Glottech-USA. We will receive a royalty in respect of sales of
the technology secured by us. The term of the initial agreement will be for 5
years with the possibility of extension if sales targets are achieved.  
 Pursuant to the license agreement, we obtained the exclusive
right to use the mechanical ultrasound technology within the field of
non-petro-chemical mining within the territory of Canada. We may also sublicense
our rights under the license in respect of one or more units of the technology
to any entity operating within the field of use in which we own or beneficially
own at least a 20% equity interest. GD Glottech International agreed to supply
us with up to 5 technology units per 12-month period from the effective date of
the license term, which will start from the month of delivery of the unit of the
technology. The first unit of the technology provided under the license to be
provided at no additional cost to us and subsequent units shall be subject to a
fee based on the then current retail price of the units. If we sublicense any of
our rights, the term of the applicable license will be for 5 years from the date
the applicable unit is delivered. Pursuant to the license agreement, GD Glottech
International shall provide ongoing technical assistance and training in respect
of our use of the technology at our cost.  
 In consideration of the license, we will pay to GD Glottech
International a royalty based on the tonnage of water produced by our use of the
technology in accordance with the agreement. A minimum annual royalty will be
applicable. The term of the license agreement shall be for an initial period of
5 years and shall be renewable for additional terms of 5 years provided that we
satisfy the minimum royalty requirements during each period.  
 GD Glottech International s technology is designed to separate
suspended solids from water (brine), which is one step in the process that we
are taking to produce commercially viable minerals. The technology produces
extremely high temperatures, which destroy organic substances such as bacteria
and other toxic agents. We believe that GD Glottech International's technology
can provide lower costs of operation as well as reduced time for site clean-up
than traditional methods of water treatment. We anticipate using this
application to extract dissolved solids like lithium, potassium, and magnesium
from oil field brine. The disposal of produced water (brine) from oil and gas
production in Alberta is a significant environmental issue for the province and
presents a considerable economic issue for producers. We intend to use the
technology on our Valleyview Property in Alberta, in cooperation with oil and
gas producers, to treat and dispose of their produced water while monetizing the
minerals that are contained within that produced water stream that is being
brought to the surface during the oil and gas production process. As we owned the
MAIM (Metals and Industrial Minerals) claims to the minerals on the Valleyview
Property, the minerals contained in their produced water stream fall under our
rights. While we have had discussions with oil and gas consultants and oil
operators regarding their difficulties in treating the brine at some of their
fields, we have no formal agreements in place.  
 The technical process is based on the use of mechanical
ultrasound generated through the production of a series of cavitations.
Mechanical ultrasound is a machine-produced sound of a frequency above the upper
limit of the normal range of human hearing. Cavitations are the rapid formation
and collapse of bubbles in liquids, caused by the movement of something such as a propeller or by waves of high-frequency
sound. The production of mechanical ultrasound allows GD Glottech
International s technology to distill the fluid stock. Using mechanical
ultrasound for distillation has been attempted before, but the external energy
requirement needed to produce the mechanical ultrasound was far too expensive to
make it commercially viable. GD Glottech International s technology uses the
energy released during the cavitations in order to make it commercially viable
from an economic perspective. During these cavitations, a millisecond of energy
is released. During this release, temperatures can reach 5,000 degrees
centigrade.  

On August 27, 2012, we filed a motion to amend our complaint to
include claims of breach of trust and fiduciary duty, breach of good faith and
fair dealing, breach of contract, conversion of funds, fraud, and the imposition
of a constructive trust. We believe that this action was necessary to protect
our interests against possible misuse of funds by Glottech-USA, LLC and its
principals. We will also seek damages as appropriate.  
 On October 19, 2012, GD Glottech International moved to
intervene as an interested party in the litigation pending against Glottech-USA.
GD Glottech International cited its role as owner of the patents as a basis for
intervening in the litigation against Glottech-USA. We believe GD Glottech
International s entry into the litigation against Glottech-USA is favorable to
our cause in the litigation.  
 On October 22, 2012, the Court of Common Pleas in Chester
County, Pennsylvania, granted our motion to amend our complaint against
Glottech-USA to add claims for fraud and damages reflective of the malfeasance
which we allege against Glottech-USA and its officers.  
 On December 12, 2012, GD Glottech International removed the
management of Glottech-USA and appointed itself as the manager of Glottech-USA.
On the same day, Larry Nesbit, Mark Siegel and Ron Fender filed a motion to
dissolve Glottech-USA in Mississippi on the basis that Glottech-USA was unable
to meet its financial obligations and could not finish or deliver the unit to
us.  
 On December 19, 2012, an attorney purportedly acting on behalf
of Glottech-USA filed a motion in the lawsuit pending in Chester County,
Pennsylvania, seeking possession of the unit. In addition, Glottech-USA filed a
counterclaim seeking possession of the unit.  
 GD Glottech International immediately filed a motion to quash
Glottech-USA s motion and for sanctions against the law firm that filed the
motion. We also filed a motion, seeking disqualification of the law firm that
purported to represent Glottech-USA on the basis that the new management for
Glottech-USA had fired the law firm and, as such, the law firm no longer had
authority to represent Glottech-USA.  
 On April 25, 2013, we attended a hearing on the motions pending
in the lawsuit filed in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The Court did not rule on
any of the motions and, instead, stayed the case as to Glottech-USA until
December of 2013 pending the outcome of the lawsuit seeking dissolution of
Glottech-USA. The matter in Pennsylvania is no longer stayed. An attorney
purporting to represent Glottech-USA and the receiver appointed in Mississippi
has filed motions and other documents that may move the matter forward. We have
pending preliminary objections to the counterclaim, including a request for a
determination of which group is in control of Glottech-USA.  
 Certain members of Glottech-USA continue to pursue dissolution
of the company in Mississippi. The members of Glottech-USA who seek dissolution
have stated in court filings that it is not practicable for Glottech-USA to
continue as an ongoing business. In addition, Sulzer filed suit against
Glottech-USA Texas for unfulfilled obligations.  
 We do not believe that Glottech-USA has sufficient capital to
continue as an ongoing business. We have provided full consideration to
Glottech-USA and complied with all other agreed upon terms. We believe any
assertions against us to lack merit.  
 Given pending litigation against Glottech-USA, and the
uncertainties naturally inherent of any litigation (particularly as to outcome
and timing thereof), we have moved to assure continuity of our licensing rights
through entering into, and exercising, the option to contract directly with the
technology inventor and patents owner, GD Glottech International.  

Thus, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, or indeed
any action or inaction of Glottech-USA, our interest in the technology is
assured.  
 On December 18, 2015 we withdrew our complaint against
Glottech-USA, LLC filed in Court of Common Pleas in Chester County,
Pennsylvania. Concurrently, we released Glottech  USA, LLC and its former
principals, Mark Seigel, Larry Nesbit and Ron Fender , from any and all claims
related to the complaint.

Item 6.   
      Selected Financial Data 
   
 As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to
provide the information required by this Item.  

Item 7.   
      Management s Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
audited financial statements and the related notes for the years ended June 30,
2016 and June 30, 2015 that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed
below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled
"Risk Factors" beginning on page 31 of this annual report.  
 Our audited financial statements are stated in United States
Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.  
  Plan of Operation   
  Capital Expenditures   
 We do not intend to invest in capital expenditures during the
twelve-month period ending June 30, 2016.  
  General and Administrative Expenses   
 We expect that we will require $650,000 during the twelve-month
period ending June 30, 2017 on general and administrative expenses including
legal and auditing fees, rent, office equipment, consulting fees, salaries, and
other administrative related expenses.  

Product Research and Development   
 We do not anticipate expending any funds on research and
development, manufacturing and engineering over the twelve months ending June
30, 2017.  
  Purchase of Significant Equipment   
 We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the
twelve months ending June 30, 2017.  
  Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and
2015   
 The following summary of our results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 Our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 are summarized as follows:  
 
  Revenues   
 We have not earned revenues since our inception.  
  Operating Expenses   
 Our operating expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015 are outlined in the table below:  
 
 The decrease of $1,305,415 in operating expenses for the year
ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in fiscal 2015, was mainly due
to a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a decrease
in impairment loss during the fiscal 2016. The decrease in selling, general, and
administrative expenses resulted primarily from our sale of the assets and
business of our 51% owned subsidiary, Alta Disposal Morinville, Ltd.  

Liquidity and Financial Condition   
  Working Capital   
 
 As of June 30, 2016, our total current assets were $48,007, our
total current liabilities were $2,521,607 and we had a working capital deficit
of $2,473,600 (June 30, 2015 - $2,456,476). Our financial statements report a net
loss of $1,340,617 as at June 30, 2016 and an accumulated deficit of $50,806,438
for the period from May 31, 2006 (date of inception) to June 30, 2016 (June 30,
2015 - $49,504,350).  
 We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The
continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and
maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In
this regard we have raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan
transactions.  
  Cash Flows   
 
 We had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $64,099 as of
June 30, 2015 as compared to $57,632 as of June 30, 2014. We had a working
capital deficit of $2,473,600 as of June 30, 2016 compared to working capital
deficit of $2,456,476 as of June 30, 2015.  
 Our principal sources of funds have been from sales of our
common stock and the issuance of convertible debentures.  
  Anticipated Cash Requirements   
 We estimate that our expenses over the next 12 months will be
approximately $650,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may
change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities
and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources.  
 
 We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months
through the use of the cash we have on hand and through equity financing, debt
financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity
ownership of our shares. We currently do not have any other arrangements in
place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance
that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will
be acceptable to us.  

Contractual Obligations   
 As a  smaller reporting company,  we are not required to
provide tabular disclosure obligations.  
  Going Concern   
 Our audited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that our Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2016, we had a
working capital deficiency of $2,473,600 (June 30, 2015 - $2,456,476) and an
accumulated deficit of $50,806,439 (June 30, 2015 - $49,504,348). We intend to
fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient
to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements
for the next twelve months.  
 Our ability to emerge from the exploration stage is dependent
upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations,
explore and develop the mineral properties and the discovery, development and
sale of ore reserves.  
 In response to these problems, our management intends to raise
additional funds through public or private placement offerings.  
 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty..  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 Our audited financial statements and accompanying notes are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the
United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that
understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an
understanding of our financial statements.  
  Restatement to previously issued financial statements  
 Subsequent to the issuance of June 30, 2015 financial
statements, management determined that the warrants issued were incorrectly
valued and derivative liability on the conversion option embedded in convertible
notes was not recognized and during the year period ending June 30, 2016, these
warrants were revalued and a derivative liability on the conversion option was
calculated. As a result of revaluation of the warrants, the consolidated balance
sheet for the year ending June 30, 2015, the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year period ending June 30, 2015 and consolidated statements of
changes in stockholders' deficit for the period ending June 30, 2014 and June
30, 2015 were restated. 
 The tables contained in Item 13 of the notes to the June 30, 2016 financial statements reflect the corrections to the affected line items in
the previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30,
2015. 
  Principal of Consolidation   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Ltd.  and its 51% owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Bluetap Resources Ltd.). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in conformity with the applicable accounting framework. The consolidated financial statements do not include  the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiary, Black Box Energy, Inc., which was incorporated subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2016.  
  Use of Estimates   
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the
financial statements and future operations of the Company. Significant estimates
that may materially change in the near term include the valuation of derivative
liabilities and the underlying warrants, as well as fair value of investments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market
funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than
three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which,
in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in
value. The Company had $25,208 and $64,098 in cash and cash equivalents at June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Concentration of Risk   
 The Company maintains cash balances at a financial institution
which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured limits for banks located in the US. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company had no deposits in excess of federally insured limits in its US bank.
The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and
believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash in bank accounts.
 
  Prepaid Expenses   
 Prepaid expenses consist of security deposit for office lease
which will be expensed or refunded at the end of the lease period.  
  Start-Up Costs   
 In accordance with FASC 720-15-20  Start-Up Costs,  the Company
expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of
the Company.  
  Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs   
 The Company has been in the exploration stage since its
formation on May 31, 2006. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of mining properties. Mineral property acquisition
and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that
a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing
proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are
capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method
over the estimated life of the probable reserves.  
  Concentrations of Credit Risk   
 Our company s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of our cash and cash equivalents
and related party payables we will likely incur in the near future. Our company
places our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit
worthiness. At times, our cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial
institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. Our company s
management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any
parties to which we extend funds, and as such, we believe that any associated
credit risk exposures are limited.  
  Non-controlling Interest   
 The 49% third party ownership of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd.
(formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.) at June 30, 2016 and 2015 are recorded as
non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Details of
changes in the non-controlling interests during the years ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 and are reflected in the consolidated statement of deficit.    

Related Parties  
 Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the
parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties
also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the
immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and
other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an
extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party
transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or
services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the
cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party
in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related party. 
  Net Income or (Loss) per Share of Common Stock   
 The Company has adopted FASC Topic No. 260,  Earnings Per
Share,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face
of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and
requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In
the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period.  
 Potentially dilutive securities are not presented in the
computation of EPS since their effects are anti-dilutive. The total number of
potential no. of shares is 441,092,305 at the year ending June 30, 2016.  
  Foreign Currency Translations   
 The Company s functional and reporting currency is the US
dollar. All transactions initiated in other currencies are translated into US
dollars using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
US dollar at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from such transactions are deferred
until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders 
equity (deficit) as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Upon
realization, the amount deferred is recognized in income in the period when it
is realized.  
 Translation of Foreign Operations  
 The financial results and position of foreign operations whose
functional currency is different from the Company s presentation currency are
translated as follows: 
 - assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange
rates prevailing at that reporting date;  - equity is translated at
historical exchange rates; and  - income and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates for the period. 
 Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign
operations are transferred directly to the Company s accumulated other
comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated
statements of operations.  
 The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the period
ending June 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.769 CDN$: US$, average rate at 0.7761
CDN$: US$ and for the year ended June 30, 2015 closing rate at 0.8017 CDN$: US$,
average rate at 0.8518 CDN$: US$.  Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 FASC Topic No. 220,  Comprehensive Income,  establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. As at June 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company had no material items of other comprehensive income except for
the foreign currency translation adjustment.  

Risks and Uncertainties   
 Our company operates in the resource exploration industry that
is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial,
operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource
exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure.  
  Environmental Expenditures   
 The operations of our company have been, and may in the future
be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental
regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs.
Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon our company
vary greatly and are not predictable. Our company's policy is to meet or, if
possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of
technically proven and economically feasible measures.  
 Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental
and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized
and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of
expenditures incurred since inception have been charged against earnings due to
the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and
site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable,
are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related
business operation, net of expected recoveries.  
  Warrants   
 The Company accounts for currently outstanding detachable
warrants to purchase common stock as derivative liabilities as they are
freestanding derivative financial instruments. The warrants are recorded as
derivative liabilities at fair value, estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model, and marked to market at each balance sheet date, with changes in
the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon exercise of a derivative
financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion
date and is reclassified to equity. 
  Convertible Instruments   
 The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options
embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging . It provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to
bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as
free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include
circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the
embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the
economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid
instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host
contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally
accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings
as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The result of
this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument
is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market at
each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair
value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the
statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or
exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair
value at the conversion date and is reclassified to equity. The Company records,
when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of
conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences
between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of
the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.
Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
related debt to their earliest date of notes redemption.  
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence
surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the
inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities;  
 Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level
1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.  
 The carrying amounts of our company s financial assets and
liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deposit,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to a related party approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  
 Our company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the
derivative liability of our company s secured convertible promissory notes and
debentures issued to investors, and the derivative warrants issued in connection
with these convertible promissory notes and debentures. There is no current
market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires
significant judgment or estimation. Our company used a lattice model which
incorporates transaction details such as company stock price, contractual terms,
maturity, risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings,
volatility, and holder behavior as of the date of issuance and each balance
sheet date.  
  Revenue Recognition   
 The Company has generated little revenues to date. It is the
Company s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized
in accordance with ASC 605  Revenue Recognition . Four basic criteria must be
met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and
determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of
criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed
nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of
those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated
returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same
period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for
which the product/services was not delivered or is subject to refund until such
time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product/service has been delivered or no refund will be required.  
 Sales comprise the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable for the sale of goods and rendering of services in the ordinary
course of the Company s activities. Sales are presented, net of tax, rebates and
discounts, and after eliminating intercompany sales. The Company recognizes
revenue when the amount of revenue and related cost can be reliably measured and
it is probable that the collectability of the related receivables is reasonably
assured.  
 During the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
didn t record any revenue under continuing operation.  
  Receivables   
 Trade and other receivables are customer obligations due under
normal trade terms and are recorded at face value less any provisions for
uncollectible amounts considered necessary. The Company includes any balances
that are determined to be uncollectible in its overall allowance for doubtful
accounts. The Company recorded $Nil (June 30, 2015 - $18,984) in allowance for
doubtful accounts.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update
which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that
result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be
able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities
classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive
income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost
method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions,
entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily
determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or minus adjustments
for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized
in earnings. This new standard does not change the guidance for classifying and
measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective
for us on July 1, 2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company
is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on its
consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any
entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The
guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of
Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
ASU No. 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue
recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent.
ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has
control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and
provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when
services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods
or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective
date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.
The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  
Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this
Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If
an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess
tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements,
forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified
retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to
equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement
of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory
withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement
and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the
presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either
a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are
currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance
obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing
implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its
consolidated financial statements.  

FASB ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  was issued in June
2016 and clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, presentation
of taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract
modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition and how guidance
in Topic 606 is retrospectively applied. The amendments do not change the core
principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective dates are the same as
those for Topic 606.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.    
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. (the  Company ), as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related statement of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders  deficit and cash flows for the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.    
 We have conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit, negative cash flows from operations, and working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to this matter are described in Note 8. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.   
     
        Organization     
 Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Mariposa Resources,
Ltd.) (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 31, 2006 in the State of Nevada,
U.S.A. It is based in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The accounting and reporting
policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, and the Company s fiscal year end is June 30.  
 Effective November 30, 2010, the Company changed its name to
 Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.,  by way of a merger with its wholly-owned
subsidiary Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., which was formed solely for the
change of name.  
 A wholly owned subsidiary, 1617437 Alberta Ltd. was
incorporated in the province of Alberta, Canada on July 8, 2011. Effective
October 2, 2013, the subsidiary changed its name to Alta Disposal Ltd. 
 On October 18, 2013, the Company acquired 51% interest in Alta
Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.). Effective September
4, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Cancen Oil
Canada whereby the Company agrees to sell all right, title and interest of Alta
Disposal Morinville Ltd. assets for total purchase price of CAD$10,000
approximately USD$7,466. 
 On March 1, 2014, the Company through its 100% subsidiary Alta
Disposal Ltd. acquired 50% interest in Tero Oilfield Services Ltd. (the  Tero )
On May 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with an
individual and disposed its 50% interest in Tero.  
 The Company is engaged principally in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of resource properties. Prior to June 25, 2009, the
Company had the right to conduct exploration work on 20 mineral mining claims in
Esmeralda County, Nevada, U.S.A. On July 31, 2009, the Company acquired an
option to enter into a joint venture for the management and ownership of the
Jack Creek Project, a mining project located in Elko County, Nevada. On
September 25, 2009, the joint venture was terminated and the Company entered
into an agreement with Beeston Enterprises Ltd., under which the Company was
granted an option to acquire an undivided 50% interest in eight mineral claims
located in the Clinton Mining District of British Columbia, Canada. On December
16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement to acquire an
undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to certain mineral permits
located in the Province of Alberta, Canada (see Note 5). On November 8, 2011,
the Company entered into a letter agreement with Glottech-USA. Pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, the Company was granted an exclusive license to use and
distribute the technology within the Swan Hills region of Alberta as well as a
non-exclusive right to distribute the technology within Canada. 

2.   
     
        Significant Accounting
Policies     
  Basis of presentation and consolidation  
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 
 The consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2015 were
restated during the period, and include all disclosures required by the
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  Principal of Consolidation   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Ltd. and its 51% owned
subsidiary Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Bluetap Resources Ltd.).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in
conformity with the applicable accounting framework.  
  Use of Estimates   
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions,
uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future
operations of the Company. Significant estimates that may materially change in
the near term include the valuation of derivative liabilities and the underlying
warrants, as well as fair value of investments.  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market
funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than
three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which,
in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in
value. The Company had $25,208 and $64,098 in cash and cash equivalents at June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

2.   
     
        Significant Accounting Policies -
         Continued      
  Concentration of Risk   
 The Company maintains cash balances at a financial institution
which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured limits for banks located in the US. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company had no deposits in excess of federally insured limits in its US bank.
The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and
believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash in bank accounts.
 
  Prepaid expenses   
 Prepaid expenses consist of security deposit for office lease
which will be expensed or refunded at the end of the lease period. 
  Start-Up Costs   
 In accordance with FASC 720-15-20   Start-Up Costs,   the
Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and
organization of the Company.  
  Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs   
 The Company has been in the exploration stage since its
formation on May 31, 2006. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of mining properties. Mineral property acquisition
and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that
a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing
proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are
capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method
over the estimated life of the probable reserves.  
  Concentrations of Credit Risk   
 The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents
and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit
worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial
institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company s
management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any
parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated
credit risk exposures are limited.  
  Non-controlling Interest   
 The 49% third party ownership of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd.
(formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.) at June 30, 2016 and 2015 are recorded as
non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Details of
changes in the non-controlling interests during the years ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 and are reflected in the consolidated statement of deficit.  
  Related Parties  
 Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the
parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties
also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the
immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and
other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The
Company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions shall be
recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased
from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any
payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected
as a distribution to related party.

 The Company has adopted FASC Topic No. 260,   Earnings Per
Share ,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the
face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures
and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In
the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period.  
 Potentially dilutive securities are not presented in the
computation of EPS since their effects are anti-dilutive. The total number of
potential no. of shares is 441,092,305 at the year ending June 30, 2016.

  Foreign Currency Translations   
 The Company s functional and reporting currency is the US
dollar. All transactions initiated in other currencies are translated into US
dollars using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
US dollar at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from such transactions are deferred
until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders 
equity (deficit) as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Upon
realization, the amount deferred is recognized in income in the period when it
is realized.  
 Translation of Foreign Operations  
 The financial results and position of foreign operations whose
functional currency is different from the Company s presentation currency are
translated as follows:  - assets and liabilities are translated at period-end
exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date;  - equity is translated at
historical exchange rates; and  - income and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates for the period. 
 Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign
operations are transferred directly to the Company s accumulated other
comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated
statements of operations.  
 The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the period
ending June 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.769 CDN$: US$, average rate at 0.7761
CDN$: US$ and for the year ended June 30, 2015 closing rate at 0.8017 CDN$: US$,
average rate at 0.8518 CDN$: US$. 
  Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 FASC Topic No. 220,   Comprehensive Income,   establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. As at June 30, 2016 and
2015, the Company had no material items of other   comprehensive income
except for the foreign currency translation adjustment. 
  Risks and Uncertainties   
 The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that
is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial,
operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource
exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure.

        Significant Accounting Policies -
         Continued      
  Environmental Expenditures   
 The operations of the Company have been, and may in the future
be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental
regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs.
Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company
vary greatly and are not predictable. The Company's policy is to meet or, if
possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of
technically proven and economically feasible measures.  
 Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental
and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized
and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of
expenditures incurred since inception have been charged against earnings due to
the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and
site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable,
are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related
business operation, net of expected recoveries.  
  Warrants   
 The Company accounts for currently outstanding detachable
warrants to purchase common stock as derivative liabilities as they are
freestanding derivative financial instruments. The warrants are recorded as
derivative liabilities at fair value, estimated using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model, and marked to market at each balance sheet date, with changes in
the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon exercise of a derivative
financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion
date and is reclassified to equity. 
  Convertible Instruments   
 The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options
embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging . It provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to
bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as
free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include
circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the
embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the
economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid
instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host
contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally
accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings
as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The result of
this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument
is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market at
each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair
value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the
statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or
exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair
value at the conversion date and is reclassified to equity. The Company records,
when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of
conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences
between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of
the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.
Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
related debt to their earliest date of notes redemption

        Significant Accounting Policies -
         Continued      
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence
surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the
inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  
 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities;  
 Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level
1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.  
 The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and
liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deposit,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to a related party approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  
 The Company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the
liability of the Company s secured convertible promissory notes and debentures
issued to investors, and the derivative warrants issued in connection with these
convertible promissory notes and debentures. There is no current market for
these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant
judgment or estimation. The Company used a fair value model which incorporates
transaction details such as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity,
risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and
holder behavior as of the date of issuance and each balance sheet date.  
  Revenue Recognition   
 The Company has generated little revenues to date. It is the
Company s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized
in accordance with ASC 605  Revenue Recognition . Four basic criteria must be
met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and
determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of
criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed
nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of
those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated
returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same
period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for
which the product/services was not delivered or is subject to refund until such
time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product/service has been delivered or no refund will be required.  
 Sales comprise the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable for the sale of goods and rendering of services in the ordinary
course of the Company s activities. Sales are presented, net of tax, rebates and
discounts, and after eliminating intercompany sales. The Company recognizes
revenue when the amount of revenue and related cost can be reliably measured and
it is probable that the collectability of the related receivables is reasonably
assured.  
 During the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
didn t record any revenue under continuing operation.  

2.   
     
        Significant Accounting Policies -
         Continued      
  Income Taxes   
 The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the
provisions of ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes  which requires, among other things, an
asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and
liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A
valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will
not be realized.  
 The Company also follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 related
to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed,
some positions taken may be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the
position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is
recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all
available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the
position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals
or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or
aggregated with other positions. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has
had no uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties,
if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative
expenses. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has
it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. 
  Receivables   
 Trade and other receivables are customer obligations due under
normal trade terms and are recorded at face value less any provisions for
uncollectible amounts considered necessary. The Company includes any balances
that are determined to be uncollectible in its overall allowance for doubtful
accounts. The Company recorded $Nil (June 30, 2015 - $18,984) in allowance for
doubtful accounts.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update
which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that
result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be
able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities
classified today as available for sale as a component of other comprehensive
income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost
method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions,
entities will be able to elect to record equity investments without readily
determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or minus adjustments
for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings. This
new standard does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring
investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective for us on
July 1, 2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company is
currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any
entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The
guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of
Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For
public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on its
consolidated financial statements.

        Significant Accounting Policies -
         Continued      
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue
recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent.
ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has
control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and
provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when
services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods
or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective
date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.
The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation  
Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this
Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If
an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess
tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements,
forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified
retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to
equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement
of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory
withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement
and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the
presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either
a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are
currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance
obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing
implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its
consolidated financial statements.  
 FASB ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  was issued in June
2016 and clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, presentation
of taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract
modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition and how guidance
in Topic 606 is retrospectively applied. The amendments do not change the core
principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective dates are the same as
those for Topic 606.

        Capital Stock     
 On January 19, 2015, the Company's board of directors consented
to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares
of common stock on a basis of 20 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share
of common stock. The reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by
the FNRA effective February 25, 2015.  
 On July 13, 2015, the Company's board of directors consented to
effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of
common stock on a basis of 200 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share of
common stock. The reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by
the FNRA effective September 30, 2015. The Company s authorized capital will not
be affected by the reverse stock split. The split is reflected retrospectively
in the accompanying financial statements.  
  Authorized Stock   
 At inception, the Company authorized 100,000,000 common shares
and 100,000,000 preferred shares, both with a par value of $0.001 per share.
Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any
matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.  
 On April 8, 2009, the Company increased the number of
authorized shares to 600,000,000 shares, of which 500,000,000 shares are

value of $100 per share. The designated preferred stock is convertible at the
option of the holder, at any time beginning one year from the date such shares
are issued, into common stock of the Company with a par value of $0.001. All
shares of common stock of the Company, shall be of junior rank to all series A
preferred stock in respect to the preferences as to distributions and payments
upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. All other
shares of preferred stock shall be of junior rank to all series A preferred
shares in respect to the preferences as to distributions and payments upon the
liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company.

convertible preferred stock with a par value $0.001 per share, issuable only in
consideration of the extinguishment of existing debt convertible in to the
Company s common stock with a par value of $0.001. The designated preferred
stock shall be issued on the basis of 1 preferred stock for each $1 of
convertible debt. The series B convertible preferred stock shall be subordinate
to and rank junior to all indebtedness of the Company now or hereafter
outstanding. 
 On October 17, 2014, the Company amended its Articles of
Incorporation, which amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on
October 17, 2014, to increase the authorized capital of its common shares from
500,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 to 2,000,000,000 common shares, par
value $0.001.

The Company's authorized capital consists of 2,000,000,000
common shares and 100,000,000 preferred shares, all with a par value of $0.001.
     
 Effective June 22, 2015, the Company designated 50,000,000 of
its 100,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as series A preferred
stock. The series A preferred stock, par value $0.001, will rank senior to the Company s common stock, carrying general voting
rights with the common stock at the rate of 62 votes per share. The series A
preferred stock will be deemed cancelled within 1 year of issuance and are not
entitled to share in dividends or other distributions. So long as any shares of
series A preferred stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of not less than
75% of those outstanding shares of series A preferred stock will be required for
any change to the Company s Articles of Incorporation. 

 Effective September 9, 2015, the Company increase the
authorized capital of its common shares from 2,000,000,000 common shares, par

  Issuances of Preferred Shares  
 On June 22, 2015, the Company designated 50,000,000 of its
100,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock as Series  A  Preferred Stock.
The Series  A  Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, ranks senior to the common
stock and carries general voting rights with the common stock at the rate of 62
votes per share. The Series  A  Preferred Stock will be deemed cancelled within
1 year of issuance and is not entitled to share in dividends or other
distributions. So long as any shares of Series  A  Preferred Stock are
outstanding, the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of those outstanding
shares of Series  A  Preferred Stock will be required for any change to articles
of incorporation. 
 On July 6, 2015, the Company issued 130,000 Series  A 
preferred shares in consideration of the release and discharge of a first
ranking general security interest over all current and future assets of Alta
Disposal Ltd. that was granted to secure to the promissory note entered into on
July 22, 2014. These shares were issued at par value of $0.001. These shares
were subsequently cancelled on December 5, 2015 therefore the net impact on
share capital is nil.

        Provision for Income
Taxes     
 The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the
year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income,
regardless of when reported for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided in the
financial statements under FASC 740-20-20 to give effect to the resulting
temporary differences which may arise from differences in the bases of fixed
assets, depreciation methods, allowances, and start-up costs based on the income
taxes expected to be payable in future years. 
 Exploration stage deferred tax assets arising as a result of net operating loss carryforwards have been offset completely by a valuation allowance, based upon management evaluation that such losses will more likely than not will be utilized in future periods. Additonally, the utilization of net operating losses may be limited by change of control provisions under IRC section 382 of the Internal Revenue code. Management has not evaluated if a change of control has taken place, as of  date of the statements. Operating loss carryforwards generated during the period from May 31, 2006 (date of inception) through June 30, 2016 of approximately $15,320,225 will begin to expire in 2026. Accordingly, deferred tax assets were offset by the valuation allowance that increased by approximately $795,006 and $3,017,712 during the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 
 The Company follows the provisions of uncertain tax positions
as addressed in FASC 740-10-65-1. The Company recognized approximately no
increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

4.   
     
        Provision for Income Taxes -
         Continued      
 The Company has no tax position at June 30, 2016 for which the
ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in
operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the
periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at
June 30, 2016. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry forward
may be unlikely as a result of its intended exploration stage activities. The
tax years for June 30, 2015, June 30, 2014, June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012 are
still open for examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

        Mineral Property Costs     
   Mineral Permit (Assignment Agreement with Lithium
Exploration VIII Ltd.)      
 On December 16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment
Agreement to acquire the following:  

a.) 
     
       An undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to
      certain mineral permits located in the Province of Alberta,
  Canada.   

b.) 
     
       All of the assignor s right, title and interest in and to
      the Option Agreement.    
 In consideration for the Assignment, the Company agreed to pay
US$90,000 by way of cash or stock of equal value (consisting of amounts
previously paid by the Assignor pursuant to the Option Agreement). The full
$90,000 (consisting of option payments  i  and  v  below) was expensed and
included in the December 31, 2011 accounts payable balance. The Option shall be
in good standing and exercisable by the Company by paying the following amounts
on or before the dates specified in the following schedule:  
 
 The Optionee shall provide a refundable amount of CDN$50,000
(paid) to the Optionor by November 2, 2010, which shall be applied by the
Optionor towards work assessment expenses acceptable to the Government of
Alberta, with any unused portion to be applied against payments required to
maintain the permits underlying the property in good   standing.  
 On December 31, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to
amend the original payment requirement of CDN$100,000 due on January 1, 2013 to
the following payments: CDN $20,000 (paid) cash payment due on January 1, 2013
and CDN $80,000 by a 15% one year promissory note starting January 1, 2013. The
promissory note is interest free until June 30, 2013. After then, interest will
accrue on the principal balance then in arrears at the rate of 15% per annum. No
payments shall be payable until December 31, 2013. At any time, the Optionor may

        Going Concern and Liquidity
  Considerations     
 The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2016, the Company
had a working capital deficiency of $2,473,600 (June 30, 2015 - $2,456,476) and
an accumulated deficit of $50,806,439 (June 30, 2015 - $49,504,348). The Company
intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be
insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash
requirements for the next twelve months.  
 The ability of the Company to emerge from the exploration stage
is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to
continue operations, explore and develop the mineral properties and the
discovery, development and sale of ore reserves.  
 In response to these problems, management intends to raise
additional funds through public or private placement offerings.  
 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

      statements     
 Subsequent to the issuance of June 30, 2015 financial

calculated. As a result of revaluation of the warrants, the consolidated balance

operations and comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year period ending June 30, 2015 and consolidated statements of

      Controls and Procedures 
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our
management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016.  
 Our management, with the participation of our president (our
principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal
financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our president
(our principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and principal
financial officer) has concluded that, as of the end of such period, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information
that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive
officer, principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our president
(our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal
accounting officer and principal financial officer), to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of our company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of our company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of
our financial statements would be prevented or detected.  

Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued
effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
 Management has conducted, with the participation of our
president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our
principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2016 in accordance with the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control
  Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as
of June 30, 2014, our company s internal control over financial reporting was
not effective based on present company activity. Our company is in the process
of adopting specific internal control mechanisms with our board and officers 
collaboration to ensure effectiveness as we grow. We are presently engaging an
outside consultant to assist in adopting new measures to improve upon our
internal controls. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks
and balances and communication strategies between the management and the board
to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as
more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial reporting.
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report from
our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only the management s report in this annual
report.  
  Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

      Governance     
 All of the directors of our company hold office until the next
annual meeting of the stockholders or until their successors have been elected
and qualified. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold

     Alexander Walsh  
     President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
     
     36  
 November 4, 2010    

  Business Experience   
 The following is a brief account of the education and business
experience of each director and executive officer during at least the past five
years, indicating each person's principal occupation during the period, and the
name and principal business of the organization by which he was employed.  
   Alexander Walsh   President, Chief Executive Officer,
Secretary, Treasurer and Director    
 Mr. Walsh was appointed president, chief executive officer,
secretary, treasurer, and director of our company in November 2010. From May
2008 to November of 2010, Alex Walsh was a management consultant at AW

From May 2006 to May 2008, Mr. Walsh was a small business consultant and
managing partner for Business Strategies Group. Business Strategies Group is a
highly specialized team focusing on providing employee benefits, retirement
programs, and insurance products to small and middle market companies.  
 Mr.Walsh attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana
where he majored in economics and management. Mr. Walsh was chosen as one of our
directors due to his background in venture capital, investor relations and
corporate development.  
  Family Relationships   
 There are no family relationships among our directors or
officers.  
  Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings   
 To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or
executive officers has, during the past ten years:  

1.  
     
       been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject
      to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
      minor offences);   
   
     2.  
     
       had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the
      business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or
      business association of which he was a general partner or executive
      officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years
      prior to that time;   
   
     3.  
     
       been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not
      subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent
      jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily
      enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in
      any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment,
      banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated
      with persons engaged in any such activity;     

4.  
     
       been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
      civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
      have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the
      judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;   
   
     5.  
     
       been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state
      judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
      subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement
      of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged
      violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or
      regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or
      insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or
      permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money
      penalty or temporary or permanent cease- and-desist order, or removal or
      prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud
      or fraud in connection with any business entity; or   
   
     6.  
     
       been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or
      order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any
      self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the
      Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in
      Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or
      any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has
      disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a
      member.    
  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance   
 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our
executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our
common stock, to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our
securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with
copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms
received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we
believe that during the year ended June 30, 2016, all filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial
owners were complied with, with the exception of the following:  

Name   
      Number of
      Late Reports   
      Number of
      Transactions    Not    Reported on a Timely 
        Basis   
      Failure to
    File    Requested Forms    

Alexander Walsh (1)   
     3  
     9  
 Nil    

(1)    
     
       The named officer, director or greater than 10%
      stockholder, as applicable, filed a late Form 4   Statement of Changes of
      Beneficial Ownership of Securities.    
  Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 
 Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a
member of its audit committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is "independent"
as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
 We believe that the members of our board of directors are
collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit
committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.  

Code of Ethics   
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to, among other
  persons, our company s principal executive officers and senior financial
  executives, as well as persons performing similar functions. As adopted, our
Code of Ethics sets forth written policies to promote:  

honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical
      handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
      professional relationships;    

full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
      disclosure in all reports and documents that the Corporation files with,
      or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other
      public communications made by the Corporation that are within the Senior
      Officer s area of responsibility;    

compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and
      regulations;    

the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code;
      and    

accountability for adherence to the Code.
      
 Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 14.1 to our annual report on Form
10-KSB on September 28, 2007. We will provide a copy of the Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be
sent to: Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. 3200 N. Hayden Road, Suite 235,
Scottsdale, AZ 85251.

(c)  
     
       up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure

      June 30, 2016 and 2015.    
 who we will collectively refer to as the named executive
officers of our company, are set out in the following summary compensation

other than our principal executive officers, whose total compensation did not

      consulting services to the Company during fiscal 2015 following his
      resignation.

company.  
  Stock Options/SAR Grants   
 During the period from inception to June 30, 2016, we did not
grant any stock options to our executive officers.  

Aggregated Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and Fiscal
Year-End Values   
 There were no options exercised during our fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 by any officer or director of our company.  
  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End   
 No equity awards were outstanding as of the year ended June 30,
2016.  
  Compensation of Directors   
 We reimburse our directors for expenses incurred in connection
with attending board meetings. We did not pay any directors fees during our
fiscal years ending June 30, 2016 and  2015, respectively.  
 We have no formal plan for compensating our directors for their
service in their capacity as directors. Directors are entitled to reimbursement
for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with attendance at meetings of our board of directors. Our board of directors
may award special remuneration to any director undertaking any special services
on our behalf other than services ordinarily required of a director.  
  Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and
Change in Control Arrangements   
 Effective January 12, 2014, we entered into an employment
agreement with Alexander Walsh for provision of services as our president and
chief executive officer. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, Mr.
Walsh will receive an annual salary of $120,000 payable in monthly cash
installments or, in the event cash is unavailable, in shares of our company s
common stock. The employment agreement also provides for liability insurance and
any travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred and approved by our company. The
employment agreement expired on January 12, 2016, following which Mr. Walsh has
provided his services to the Company on a month to month basis at the same rate
of compensation. 

Item 12.   
      Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
      Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
   
 The following table sets forth, as of October 13, 2016, certain
information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each
stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common
stock and by each of our current directors and executive officers. Each person
has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock,
except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct
interest in the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated.  

(1)    
     
       Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security
      includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
      arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i)
      voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
      shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or
      direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
      beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share
      the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,
      shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has
      the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an
      option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is
      provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount
      of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares
      beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of
      these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding
      shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect
      the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number
      of shares of common stock actually outstanding on October 13, 2016. As of
      October 13, 2016, there were 162,724,024 shares of our company s common
      stock issued and outstanding.     

(2)    
     
       Alexander Walsh is our company s president, chief
      executive officer, chief financial officer and director.   

(3)    
     
       Represents less than 1%   

(4)    
     
       Toledo Advisors LLC has rights under a convertible note
      to own a aggregate number of share of the issue common stock not to exceed
      9.9 percent of shares outstanding.    
  Changes in Control   
 We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or
provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent
date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions
in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent
a change in control of our company.  

Item 13.   
      Certain Relationships and Related
      Transactions, and Director Independence     
 Except as disclosed herein, there have been no transactions or
proposed transactions in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of
$120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the
last three completed fiscal years in which any of our directors, executive
officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock, or any of their respective relatives, spouses, associates or
affiliates, has had or will have any direct or material indirect interest.  
 The promoters of our company are our directors and officers.
 
  Director Independence   
 We currently act with one director, consisting of Alexander
Walsh. We have determined that we do not have an  independent director  as
defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).  
 We do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating
committee, but our entire board of directors act in such capacity. We believe
that our directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial
statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting. Our directors do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit
committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be
adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that
retaining additional independent directors who would qualify as an  audit
committee financial expert  would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development.  

Item 14.   
      Principal Accounting Fees and Services 
       
 During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
retained our independent auditor, RBSM LLP, Accountants   Advisors, to
provide services in the following categories and amounts:  

(1)    
     
       Audit fees consist of fees incurred for professional
      services rendered for the audit of our financial statements, for reviews
      of our interim financial statements included in our quarterly reports on
      Form 10-Q and for services that are normally provided in connection with
      statutory or regulatory filings or engagements.   

(2)    
     
       Audit related fees consists of fees billed for
      professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of
      the audit or review of our financial statements, but are not reported
      under "Audit Fees".   

(3)    
     
       Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services
      relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice.   

(4)    
     
       All other fees consist of fees billed for all other
      services.    
 Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by
our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and
approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective
services were rendered.  
 Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of
fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of
services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining
our independent auditor s independence.

Holding Period for Exchange Note.  Pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the
1933 Act: the holding period of the Exchange Note (and the underlying shares of

  3.01    
Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts and

email or otherwise, and each of such counterparts shall be deemed an original

agreement.  
  3.02    
Effect of Invalidity.  If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by
law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited,
invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent
that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability
of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement so long as this Agreement as so modified continues to express,
without material change, the original intentions of the Parties as to the
subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability
of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective
expectations or reciprocal obligations of the Parties or the practical
realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the Parties.
The Parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited,

September 19, 2017 (" Maturity Date ") and to pay interest on the principal
amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on September

registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of
this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 96
Village Center Drive, Freehold, NJ 07728, initially, and if changed, last
appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder
hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the
outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less
any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this
Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address
appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire
transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall
satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of
the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in
Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
 This Note is subject to the following
additional provisions:  
 1.     This Note
is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 

No service charge will be made for such registration or
transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith.  
 2.     The Company
shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be
withheld under applicable laws.  
 3.     This Note
may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (" Act ") and applicable state securities laws. Any
attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as
void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any
agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly
registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes,
whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note
electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof,
in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective
transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written
confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ")
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. 
 4.    
(a)     The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option,
at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal
face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common
stock (the "Common Stock") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share
of Common Stock equal to 65% of the   lowest closing bid price   of
the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTCQB exchange
which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common
Stock may be traded in the future (" Exchange "), for the lower of (i)
  twenty     prior   trading days immediately preceding the
issuance date of this note   or (ii) the twenty   prior trading days
including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company
or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or
other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent
after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to
include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered
within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such
conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common
Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the
Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to
conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will
be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share .  The Company agrees to honor all conversions
submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC
 Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 50% instead of
60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed
to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would
exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 
  
 (b)     Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per
annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 
 2  

(c)     During the
first six months this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by
paying to the Holder an amount of 135% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of
the Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and
the Company may not redeem this Note. This Note may not be redeemed after 180
days. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of the
Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and the
Company may not redeem this Note.  
 (d)     Upon (i) a
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of
outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving
entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  
 (e)     In case of
any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the
Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or
converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the
Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to
purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or
merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been
purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined
in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received
by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or
entity acting in good faith.  
 5.     No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on,
this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  
 6.     The Company
hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of
non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to
collect amounts called for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable
for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.  
 3  

7.     The Company
agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder in collecting any amount due under
this Note.  
 8.     If one or
more of the following described "Events of Default" shall occur:  
 (a)     The
Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or
any other note issued to the Holder by the Company; or  
 (b)     Any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate
or financial or other written statements heretofore or hereafter furnished by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Note, or the Securities Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued
shall be false or misleading in any respect; or  
 (c)     The
Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term,
provision, condition, agreement or obligation of the Company under this Note or
any other note issued to the Holder; or  
 (d)     The
Company shall (1) become insolvent; (2) admit in writing its inability to pay
its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or commence proceedings for its dissolution; (4) apply for or consent
to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a
substantial part of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy
relief, consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against it an
involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state laws as
applicable; or  
 (e)     A trustee,
liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial
part of its property or business without its consent and shall not be discharged
within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or  
 (f)     Any
governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of
any governmental agency shall assume custody or control of the whole or any
substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or  
 (g)     One or
more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in
excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate, shall be
entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets
and shall remain unpaid, un-vacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of
fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or  
 (h)     The
Company shall have defaulted on or breached any term of any other note of
similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and failed to cure
such de-fault within the appropriate grace period; or  
 4  

(i)     The
Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC
Market exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades on an exchange, then trading in
the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases
to file its 1934 act reports with the SEC;  
 (j)     If a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date
hereof are no longer serving as members of the Board; 
 (k)     The
Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4
herein without restrictive legend within 3 business days of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion; or  
 (l)     The

 (n)     The
Company shall lose the  bid  price for its stock and a market (including the OTC

 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any

or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section
8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on
the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th 
day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the
outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the
outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If this Note is
not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall
increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing
after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to
use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price
for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the
delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the
Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note
is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. 
 5  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 Make-Whole for Failure to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s
election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the
conversion shares by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a
Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a Failure to
Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Failure to
Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: Failure to
Deliver Loss = [(High trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x
(Number of conversion shares)]  
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 9.     In case any
provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall
be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the
maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
 10.     Neither
this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated
other than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.  
 11.    The Company
represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer
or that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have
passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is
no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to
either (i) write a 144 opinion to allow for salability of the conversion shares
or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
 12.    The Company
shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 274,535,000 shares
of its Common Stock for conversions under this Note and another $140,000 note of
even date herewith (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any
shares remaining in the Share Reserve shall be cancelled. The Company shall pay
all transfer agent costs associated with issuing and delivering the share
certificates to Holder. If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may
deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. The company should at all times
reserve a minimum of three times the amount of shares required if the note would
be fully converted. The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to
time to reserve such amounts. The Company will instruct its transfer agent to
provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its
conversions.  
 6  

13.    The Company will
give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not
limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall
be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 
 14.    This Note shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable
to contracts made and wholly to be performed within the State of New York and
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The
Holder and the Company hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York or in
the Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed
counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original.

invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent

subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability

agreements of the Parties, whether written or unwritten with the exception of
the Company's profit sharing plan and any agreements related thereto.

invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed to

accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving

amount of Seven Hundred Eight Thousand Dollars exactly (U.S. $708,000.00) on
September 19, 2017 (" Maturity Date ") and to pay interest on the principal
amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on September

registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of
this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 96
Village Center Drive, Freehold, NJ 07728, initially, and if changed, last
appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder
hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the
outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less
any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this
Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address
appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire
transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall
satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of
the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in
Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
 This Note is subject to the following
additional provisions:  
 1.     This Note
is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 

No service charge will be made for such registration or
transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith.  
 2.     The Company
shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be
withheld under applicable laws.  
 3.     This Note
may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (" Act ") and applicable state securities laws. Any
attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as
void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any
agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly
registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes,
whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note
electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof,
in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective
transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written
confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ")
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. 
 4.    
(a)     The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option,
at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal
face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common
stock (the "Common Stock") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share
of Common Stock equal to 60% of the   lowest reported sale price   of
the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTCQB exchange
which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common
Stock may be traded in the future (" Exchange "), for the
  twenty     prior   trading days including the day upon
which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent
(provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic
method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M.
Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the
same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business
days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be
effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder
within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion.
Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares
or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the
number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .
 The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.
 In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the
conversion price shall be decreased to 50% instead of 60% while that  Chill  is
in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if
such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.    
 (b)     Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per
annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common Stock ("Interest
Shares"). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company
for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The
dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a portion of the accrued
interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of
such notice. 
 2  

(c)     During the
first six months this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by
paying to the Holder an amount of 135% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of
the Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and
the Company may not redeem this Note. This Note may not be redeemed after 180
days. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of the
Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and the
Company may not redeem this Note.  
 (d)     Upon (i) a
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of
outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving
entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  
 (e)     In case of
any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the
Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or
converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the
Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to
purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or
merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been
purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined
in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received
by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or
entity acting in good faith.  
 5.     No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on,
this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  
 6.    The Company
hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of
non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to
collect amounts called for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable
for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.  
 3  

7.     The Company
agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder in collecting any amount due under
this Note.  
 8.     If one or
more of the following described "Events of Default" shall occur:  
 (a)     The
Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note or
any other note issued to the Holder by the Company; or  
 (b)     Any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company herein or in any certificate
or financial or other written statements heretofore or hereafter furnished by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Note, or the Securities Purchase Agreement under which this note was issued
shall be false or misleading in any respect; or  
 (c)     The
Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant, term,
provision, condition, agreement or obligation of the Company under this Note or
any other note issued to the Holder; or  
 (d)     The
Company shall (1) become insolvent; (2) admit in writing its inability to pay
its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or commence proceedings for its dissolution; (4) apply for or consent
to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a
substantial part of its property or business; (5) file a petition for bankruptcy
relief, consent to the filing of such petition or have filed against it an

applicable; or  
 (e)     A trustee,
liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for a substantial
part of its property or business without its consent and shall not be discharged
within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or  
 (f)     Any
governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of
any governmental agency shall assume custody or control of the whole or any
substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or  
 (g)     One or
more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in
excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate, shall be
entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets
and shall remain unpaid, un-vacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of
fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or  
 (h)     The
Company shall have defaulted on or breached any term of any other note of
similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and failed to cure
such default within the appropriate grace period; or  
 4  

(i)     The
Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC
Market exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades on an exchange, then trading in
the Common Stock shall be suspended for more than 10 consecutive days or ceases
to file its 1934 act reports with the SEC;  
 (j)     If a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date
hereof are no longer serving as members of the Board; 
 (k)     The
Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4
herein without restrictive legend within 3 business days of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion; or  
 (l)     The

Commission; 
 (n)     The
Company shall lose the  bid  price for its stock and a market (including the OTC

 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any

provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event
of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum
or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section
8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on
the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th 
day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the
outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the
outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If this Note is
not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall
increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing
after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to
use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price
for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the
delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the
Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note
is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall
increase by 10%.  
 5  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 Make-Whole for Failure to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s
election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the
conversion shares by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a
Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a Failure to
Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Failure to
Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: Failure to
Deliver Loss = [(High trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x
(Number of conversion shares)]  
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 9.     In case any
provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall
be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the
maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
 10.     Neither
this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated
other than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.  
 11.    The Company
represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer
or that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have
passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is
no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to
either (i) write a 144 opinion to allow for salability of the conversion shares
or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
 12.    The Company
shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving shares of its
Common Stock for conversions under this Note equal to 3x the discounted value of
the Note (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any shares
remaining in the Share Reserve shall be cancelled. The Company shall pay all
transfer agent costs associated with issuing and delivering the share
certificates to Holder. If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may
deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. The company should at all times
reserve a minimum of three times the amount of shares required if the note would
be fully converted. The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to
time to reserve such amounts. The Company will instruct its transfer agent to
provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its
conversions.  
 6  

13.    The Company will
give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not
limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall
be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 
 14.    This Note shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable
to contracts made and wholly to be performed within the State of New York and
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The
Holder and the Company hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York or in
the Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed
counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original.

delivery, memorializes and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties and supersedes and replaces all prior negotiations and
agreements of the Parties, whether written or unwritten with the exception of
the Company's profit sharing plan and any agreements related thereto.

Severance.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed to
be severed and deleted; and neither such provision, nor its severance and
deletion, shall affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving

any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this
Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address

satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of
the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in
Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
 This Note is subject to the following
additional provisions:  
 1.     This Note
is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different
authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 

No service charge will be made for such registration or
transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental
charges payable in connection therewith.  
 2.     The Company
shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be
withheld under applicable laws.  
 3.     This Note
may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (" Act ") and applicable state securities laws. Any
attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as
void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any
agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly
registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes,
whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note
electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof,
in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective
transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written
confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ")
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. 
 4.    
(a)     The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option,
at any time after cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal
face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common
stock (the "Common Stock") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share
of Common Stock equal to 65% of the   lowest closing bid price   of
the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTCQB exchange
which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common
Stock may be traded in the future (" Exchange "), for the lower of (i)
  twenty     prior   trading days immediately preceding the
issuance date of this note   or (ii) the twenty   prior trading days
including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company
or its transfer agent (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or
other electronic method of communication to the Company or its transfer agent
after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to
include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered
within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such
conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common
Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the
Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to
conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will
be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share .  The Company agrees to honor all conversions
submitted pending this increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC
 Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 50% instead of
60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed
to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would
exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company. 
  
 (b)     Interest
on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per
annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 
 2  

(c)     During the
first six months this Note is in effect, the Company may redeem this Note by
paying to the Holder an amount of 135% of the face amount plus any accrued
interest. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of
the Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and
the Company may not redeem this Note. This Note may not be redeemed after 180
days. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3 business days of the
Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and the
Company may not redeem this Note.  
 (d)     Upon (i) a
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of
outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving
entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  
 (e)     In case of
any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the
Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or
converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the
Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to
purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or
merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been
purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined
in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received
by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or
entity acting in good faith.  
 5.     No
provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on,
this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  
 6.     The Company
hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of
non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to
collect amounts called for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable
for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.

of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any
period of grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies
provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event
of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum
or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section
8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on
the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th 
day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the
outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the
outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If this Note is
not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall
increase by 10%. Further, if a breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing
after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to
use the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price
for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid price during the
delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is 50% the
Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per share. If this Note
is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%.  
 5  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 Make-Whole for Failure to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s
election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the
conversion shares by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a
Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a Failure to
Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Failure to
Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: Failure to
Deliver Loss = [(High trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x
(Number of conversion shares)]  
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 9.     In case any
provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall
be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the
maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
 10.    Neither this
Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other
than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.  
 11.    The Company
represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer
or that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have
passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is
no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to
either (i) write a 144 opinion to allow for salability of the conversion shares
or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
 12.    The Company
shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 274,535,000 shares
of its Common Stock for conversions under this Note and another $550,000 note of
even date herewith (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any
shares remaining in the Share Reserve shall be cancelled. The Company shall pay
all transfer agent costs associated with issuing and delivering the share
certificates to Holder. If such amounts are to be paid by the Holder, it may
deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. The company should at all times
reserve a minimum of three times the amount of shares required if the note would
be fully converted. The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to
time to reserve such amounts. The Company will instruct its transfer agent to
provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its
conversions.  
 6  

13.    The Company will
give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not
limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall
be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 
 14.     This Note
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York
applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed within the State of New
York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto.
The Holder and the Company hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New York or in
the Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed
counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original.

shares, the conversion   price discount shall be increased to 60%   while that  Chill  is in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the Note (except as set forth below in this Section),
the Note shall not be convertible by Investor, and Company shall not effect any
conversion of the Note or otherwise issue any shares of Common Stock to the
extent (but only to the extent) that Investor together with any of its
affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the   Maximum
Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding. To the extent the foregoing
limitation applies, the determination of whether a Note shall be convertible
(vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by
Investor or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be
convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by
Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to Company for
conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to
convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock, pursuant to this Section
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section
with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For purposes of
this Section, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations
(including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage
ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act
(as defined below) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this Section (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum
Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum
Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section shall apply to
a successor holder of this Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and
non-waivable. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of
Investor, Company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in
writing to Investor the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or
exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation,
pursuant to this Note. During the first six months, this Note is in effect, the
Investor may not convert this Note pursuant to this paragraph.  

(b)        Interest on any unpaid principal
balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall
be paid, by the Company, in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may send in
a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula
provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares
shall be all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid
principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 
                                   
(c)        This Note may not be prepaid.  
                                   
(d)        Upon (i) a transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital
reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock split
or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or
into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity
(other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of
incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  

(e)        In case of any Sale Event (not to
include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in
connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall
cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have
the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note
into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property
(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization
or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the
same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale
Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events.
If the consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash,
the value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or
successor person or entity acting in good faith.  
                     
5.          No provision of this
Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the time,
place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  
                     
6.          The Company hereby
expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment,
protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent
to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for
hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums
owing and to be owing hereto.  
                     
7.          The Company agrees to
pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
which may be incurred by the Holder in collecting any amount due under this
Note.  
                      8.         
While this Note is outstanding and to the extent the Company grants any other
party more favorable investment terms (whether via interest rate, original issue
discount, conversion discount or look-back period), the terms of the Note shall
automatically adjust to match those more favorable terms.  

9.          If one or more of the
following described "Events of Default" shall occur:

than 10 consecutive days; 

(j)        If a majority of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof are no longer serving
as members of the Board; 
                                   
(k)        The Company shall not deliver to

(p)        A default has been declared
against the Company, which has not been cured in any other loan or Note
agreement.  
 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,

this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note
shall increase by 10%. Concord is waiving all defaults that would take effect
through entering this agreement through Jan 1, 2017. Any default, once cured, will be considered a default
going forward.  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows:
 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)]  
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
                     
10.        In case any provision of this Note
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or
otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than
voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible,
and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note
will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  
                     
11.        Neither this Note nor any term
hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written
instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.  
                     
12.        The Company represents that it is
not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it
previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have passed since
the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a
 shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to either (i)
write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to allow for salability of the conversion shares or
(ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
                     
13.        The Company shall reserve
432,000,000 shares of Common Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share
Reserve ). The investor shall have the right to periodically request that the
number of Reserved Shares be increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at
least equals 400%   of the number of shares of Company common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated
with issuing and delivering the shares. At all times, the reserve shall be
maintained with the Trans-fer Agent at four times the amount of shares required if the
Note would be fully converted. If the Company defaults on these terms, the
conversion discount will increase to 60%.  

14.        The Company will give the Holder
direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name
changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the
Holder as soon as possible under law. 
                     
15.        This Note shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made
and wholly to be performed within the State of New York and shall be binding
upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company
hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and
venue in the courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this
Agreement shall be effective as an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

will pay interest on the principal amount outstanding at the rate of 10% per

the Maturity Date, less any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld,
to the Holder of this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at
the last address appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such

Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to
paragraph 4(b) herein.  
                     
This Note is subject to the following additional provisions:  
                     
1.          This Note is exchangeable for an
equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations,
as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made

Company shall be entitled to withhold any amounts from all payments it is
entitled to.  
                     
3.          This Note may only be transferred
or exchanged in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(" Act ") and any applicable state securities laws. All attempts transfer
to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due
presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company
may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's
records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be
overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound
by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the
right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the
requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this
Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note
is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as
 Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such
Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 
       
1.             4.       
(a)        The Holder of this Note has the option, upon the issuance date of the stock,
to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then
outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the " Common
Stock ") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share of Common
Stock equal to the lesser of $0.005 or 50% discount of the   lowest trading
price     of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations
Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any
exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future
(" Exchange "), for the    twenty      prior 
 trading days, including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is
received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax
or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern
Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day
closing price), or the issuance date of the Note. The Notice of Conversion may
be rescinded if the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days. The
Company shall deliver the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business
days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall
surrender this Note to the Company upon receipt of the shares of Common Stock,
executed by the Holder. This will make clear the Holder's intention to convert
this Note or a specified portion hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment
hereof in blank. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. The
number of issuable shares will be rounded to the nearest whole share, and no
fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on
conversion. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock
closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary
to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest
value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted
pending this increase . In the event the Company   experiences a DTC
 Chill  on its shares, the conversion   price discount shall be increased
to   60%   while that  Chill  is in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Note
(except as set forth below in this Section), the Note shall not be convertible
by Investor, and Company shall not effect any conversion of the Note or
otherwise issue any shares of Common Stock to the extent (but only to the
extent) that Investor together with any of its affiliates would beneficially own
in excess of 9.99% (the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the Common Stock
outstanding. To the extent the foregoing limitation applies, the determination
of whether a Note shall be convertible (vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable
or exchangeable securities owned by Investor or any of its affiliates) and of
which such securities shall be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as
among all such securities owned by Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject
to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first
submission to Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be).
No prior inability to convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock,
pursuant to this Section shall have any effect on the applicability of the
provisions of this Section with respect to any subsequent determination of
convertibility. For purposes of this Section, beneficial ownership and all
determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to
calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with
Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act (as defined below) and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a
manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section to
correct this Section (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or
inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership
limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or
desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The
limitations contained in this Section shall apply to a successor holder of this
Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and non-waivable. For any reason at
any time, upon the written or oral request of Investor, Company shall within one
(1) business day confirm orally and in writing to Investor the number of shares
of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or

(c)        This Note may not be prepaid.

Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding
shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i),
(ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"), then, in each case, the
Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of
the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of
redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid
principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid
interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at

include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in
connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall
cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have
the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note

or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the
same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale
Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events.

demand and presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of
protest, notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and
diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder and shall
be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be
owing hereto.

agreement.  
 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,

this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note
shall increase by 10%. Concord is waiving all defaults that would take effect
through entering this agreement through Jan 1, 2017. Any default, once cured,
will be considered a default going forward If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 

At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows:
 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)]

payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
                     
10.        In case any provision of this Note
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or
otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than
voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible,
and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note
will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  
                     
11.        Neither this Note nor any term
hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written
instrument signed by the Company and the Holder.  
                     
12.        The Company represents that it is
not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it
previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have passed since
the Company has reported form 10 type information indicating it is no longer a
 shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct its counsel to either (i)
write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to allow for salability of the conversion shares or
(ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
                     
13.        The Company shall reserve
135,000,000 shares of Common Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share
Reserve ). The investor shall have the right to periodically request that the
number of Reserved Shares be increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at
least equals 400%   of the number of shares of Company common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated
with issuing and delivering the shares. At all times, the reserve shall be
maintained with the Transfer Agent at four times the amount of shares required
if the Note would be fully converted. If the Company defaults on these terms,
the conversion discount will increase to 60%.  

14.        The Company will give the Holder
direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name
changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the
Holder as soon as possible under law. 
                     
15.        This Note shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made
and wholly to be performed within the State of New York and shall be binding
upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company
hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and
venue in the courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this
Agreement shall be effective as an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

 This

 1.     This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate
principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by
the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such

and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice
to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of
conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set

required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being
converted (" Notice of Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as
 Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such
Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 
 1.         
4.     (a)     The Holder of this Note
has the option, upon the issuance date of the stock, to convert all or any
amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of
the Company's common stock (the " Common Stock ") at a price
(" Conversion Price ") for each share of Common Stock equal to the lesser
of $0.005 or 50% discount of the   lowest trading price     of
the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets
exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the
Common Stock may be traded in the future (" Exchange "), for the
   twenty      prior   trading days, including the day
upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such
Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method of
communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings
Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price), or the
issuance date of the Note. The Notice of Conversion may be rescinded if the
shares have not been delivered within 3 business days. The Company shall deliver
the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by
the Company of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall surrender this Note to
the Company upon receipt of the shares of Common Stock, executed by the Holder.
This will make clear the Holder's intention to convert this Note or a specified
portion hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment hereof in blank. Accrued
but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. The number of issuable
shares will be rounded to the nearest whole share, and no fractional shares or
scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion. To the
extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par
value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the
consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible
under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this
increase . In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares,
the conversion price discount shall be increased to   60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Note (except as set forth below in
this Section), the Note shall not be convertible by Investor, and Company shall
not effect any conversion of the Note or otherwise issue any shares of Common
Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that Investor together with any of
its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the   Maximum
Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding. To the extent the foregoing
limitation applies, the determination of whether a Note shall be convertible
(vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by
Investor or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be
convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by
Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to Company for
conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to
convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock, pursuant to this Section
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section
with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For purposes of
this Section, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations
(including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage
ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act
(as defined below) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this Section (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum
Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum
Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section shall apply to
a successor holder of this Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and
non-waivable. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of
Investor, Company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in
writing to Investor the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or
exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation,
pursuant to this Note. During the first six months, this Note is in effect, the
Investor may not convert this Note pursuant to this paragraph. The conversion
discount and look-back period will be adjusted downward (i.e. for the benefit of
the Holder) if the Company offers a more favorable conversion discount (whether
via interest rate, OID, lower ceiling price or otherwise) or look-back period to
another party while this note is in effect and the Holder will also get the
benefit of any other term (for a example a higher prepay) granted to any third
party while this Note is in effect.  

(b)     Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this
Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid, by the
Company, in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 
 
(c)     This Note may not be prepaid.  

(d)     Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other
change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a
forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or
merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company
is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to
change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a
reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock
solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to as a "Sale Event"), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon
request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal
amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at
the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount
of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion
Price.  
 
(e)     In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of

 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything

provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event

default, once cured, will be considered a default going forward.  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as
follows: 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)] 
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 10.    In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible,
so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.  
 11.    Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended,
waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by
the Company and the Holder.  
 12.    The Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and
has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it previously has been a  shell 
issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form
10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The
Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to
allow for salability of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from
Holder s counsel.  
 13.    The Company shall reserve 206,000,000 shares of Common
Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share Reserve ). The investor shall
have the right to pe-riodically request that the number of Reserved Shares be
increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at least equals 400%   of
the number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the
shares. At all times, the reserve shall be maintained with the Transfer Agent at
four times the amount of shares required if the Note would be fully converted.
If the Company defaults on these terms, the conversion discount will increase to
60%.  

14.    The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any
corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits,
recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as
possible under law. 
 15.    This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be
performed within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby mutually
waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement
shall be effective as an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable
transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Security may
be made without registration under the 1933 Act, which opinion shall be accepted
by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected. The Buyer agrees to
sell all Securities, including those represented by a certificate(s) from which
the legend has been removed, in compliance with applicable prospectus delivery

Company, threatened proceeding against or affecting the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, without regard to whether it would have a material adverse effect.

PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED, AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER (THE
"1933 ACT )   
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED  Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.  (the
 Company ) promises to pay to the order of  Concord Holding Group, LLC ,
and its authorized successors and permitted assigns (" Holder "), the
aggregate principal face amount of Twenty Seven Thousand Seven Hundred and
Seventy Seven dollars and Seventy-Eight Cents exactly (U.S. $27,777.78) on
September 8, 2017 (" Maturity Date "). The Company will pay interest on the
principal amount outstanding at the rate of 10% per annum, which will commence
on September 8, 2016. The Company acknowledges that this Note was issued with a
$2,777.78 original issue discount ( OID ) such that the issuance price was
$25,000.00. The interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is
registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of
this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1080
Bergen St., Suite 240, Brooklyn, NY 11216, initially, and if changed, last
appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder
hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the
outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less
any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this
Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address
appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire
transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall
satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of
the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in
Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
 This
Note is subject to the following additional provisions: 
 1.     This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate
principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by
the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such
registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental charges
payable in connection therewith.  

2.     Under all applicable laws, the Company shall be
entitled to withhold any amounts from all payments it is entitled to.  
 3.     This Note may only be transferred or exchanged in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (" Act ") and any
applicable state securities laws. All attempts transfer to a non-qualifying
party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for
transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the
person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as
the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue,
and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice
to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of
conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set
forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this Note, also is
required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being
converted (" Notice of Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as
 Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such
Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 
 1.    
4.         
(a)     The Holder of this Note has the option, upon the
issuance date of the stock, to convert all or any amount of the principal face
amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock
(the " Common Stock ") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each
share of Common Stock equal to the lesser of $0.005 or 50% discount of the
  lowest trading price     of the Common Stock as reported on the
National Quotations Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are
traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future
(" Exchange "), for the    twenty      prior 
 trading days, including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is
received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax
or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern
Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day
closing price), or the issuance date of the Note. The Notice of Conversion may
be rescinded if the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days. The
Company shall deliver the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business
days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall
surrender this Note to the Company upon receipt of the shares of Common Stock,
executed by the Holder. This will make clear the Holder's intention to convert
this Note or a specified portion hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment
hereof in blank. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. The
number of issuable shares will be rounded to the nearest whole share, and no
fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on
conversion. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock
closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary
to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest
value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted
pending this increase . In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on
its shares, the conversion price discount shall be increased to   60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Note (except as set forth below in
this Section), the Note shall not be convertible by Investor, and Company shall
not effect any conversion of the Note or otherwise issue any shares of Common
Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that Investor together with any of
its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% (the   Maximum
Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding. To the extent the foregoing
limitation applies, the determination of whether a Note shall be convertible
(vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by
Investor or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be
convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by
Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to Company for
conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to
convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock, pursuant to this Section
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section
with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For purposes of
this Section, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations
(including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage
ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act
(as defined below) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this Section (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum
Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum
Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section shall apply to
a successor holder of this Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and
non-waivable. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of
Investor, Company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in
writing to Investor the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or
exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation,
pursuant to this Note. During the first six months, this Note is in effect, the
Investor may not convert this Note pursuant to this paragraph. The conversion
discount and look-back period will be adjusted downward (i.e. for the benefit of
the Holder) if the Company offers a more favorable conversion discount (whether
via interest rate, OID, lower ceiling price or otherwise) or look-back period to
another party while this note is in effect and the Holder will also get the
benefit of any other term (for a example a higher prepay) granted to any third
party while this Note is in effect.  

(b)     Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this
Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid, by the
Company, in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 
 (c)     This Note may not be prepaid.  

(d)     Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other
change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a
forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or
merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company
is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to
change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a
reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock
solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to as a "Sale Event"), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon
request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal
amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at
the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount
of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion
Price.  
 (e)     In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of
all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which this
Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision
to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by
converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number
of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable
upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change,
consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that
could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion
Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The
foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the
consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the
value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or
successor person or entity acting in good faith.  
 5.     No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in
the form, herein prescribed.  
 6.     The Company hereby expressly waives demand and
presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest,
notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and
diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder and shall
be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be
owing hereto.  
 7.     The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the
Holder in collecting any amount due under this Note.  
 8.     While this Note is
outstanding and to the extent the Company grants any other party more favorable
investment terms (whether via interest rate, original issue discount, conversion discount or look-back period), the terms
of the Note shall automatically adjust to match those more favorable terms.  

9.     If one or more of the following described "Events of
Default" shall occur: 
 (a)     The Company shall default in the payment of
principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the
Company; or 
 (b)     Any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements

with the execution and delivery of this Note, or the Securities Purchase
Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any
respect; or

and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any
period of grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies
provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event
of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum
or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section
8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on
the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th 
day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of
Section 8(i), (k), or (l) the outstanding principal due under this Note shall
increase by 50%. If this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal
due under this Note shall increase by 10%. Concord is waiving all defaults that
would take effect through entering this agreement through Jan 1, 2017. Any
default, once cured, will be considered a default going forward.  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as
follows: 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)] 
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 10.    In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible,
so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.  
 11.    Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended,
waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by
the Company and the Holder.  
 12.    The Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and
has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it previously has been a  shell 
issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form
10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The
Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to
allow for salability of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from
Holder s counsel.  
 13.    The Company shall reserve 22,000,000 shares of Common
Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share Reserve ). The investor shall
have the right to pe-riodically request that the number of Reserved Shares be
increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at least equals 400%   of
the number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the
shares. At all times, the reserve shall be maintained with the Transfer Agent at
four times the amount of shares required if the Note would be fully converted.
If the Company defaults on these terms, the conversion discount will increase to
60%.  

14.    The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any
corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits,
recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as
possible under law. 
 15.    This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be
performed within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby mutually
waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement
shall be effective as an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF

aggregate principal face amount of Sixty Four Thousand Four Hundred dollars and
Five cents exactly (U.S. $64,400.05) on September 9, 2017 (" Maturity

interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on the
records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note. The
principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1080 Bergen St., Suite
240, Brooklyn, NY 11216, initially, and if changed, last appearing on the
records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time
to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding
principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any amounts
required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check
or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing on the
records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall
constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and
discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum
represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common
Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
 This Note is subject to the following additional
provisions: 
 1.     This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate
principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by
the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such
registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or
other governmental charges payable in connection therewith.  

2.     Under all applicable laws, the Company shall be
entitled to withhold any amounts from all payments it is entitled to.  
 3.     This Note may only be transferred or exchanged in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (" Act ") and any
applicable state securities laws. All attempts transfer to a non-qualifying
party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for
transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the
person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as
the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue,
and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice
to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of
conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set
forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective transferee of this Note, also is
required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being
converted (" Notice of Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as
 Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such
Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. 
 1.         
4.     (a) The Holder of this Note has the option, upon the
issuance date of the stock, to convert all or any amount of the principal face
amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock
(the " Common Stock ") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each
share of Common Stock equal to the lesser of $0.0005 or 50% of the lowest
trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau
OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon
which the Common Stock may be traded in the future ("Exchange"), for the
   twenty      prior   trading days, including the day
upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such
Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method of
communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings
Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price), or the
issuance date of the Note. The Notice of Conversion may be rescinded if the
shares have not been delivered within 3 business days. The Company shall deliver
the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by
the Company of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall surrender this Note to
the Company upon receipt of the shares of Common Stock, executed by the Holder.
This will make clear the Holder's intention to convert this Note or a specified
portion hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment hereof in blank. Accrued
but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. The number of issuable
shares will be rounded to the nearest whole share, and no fractional shares or
scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion. To the
extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par
value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the
consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible
under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase . In
the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion
price discount shall be increased to 60% while that  Chill  is in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Note (except as
set forth below in this Section), the Note shall not be convertible by Investor,
and Company shall not effect any conversion of the Note or otherwise issue any
shares of Common Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that Investor
together with any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99%
(the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding. To the extent
the foregoing limitation applies, the determination of whether a Note shall be
convertible (vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities
owned by Investor or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall
be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned
by Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to Company for
conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to
convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock, pursuant to this Section
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section
with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For purposes of
this Section, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations
(including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage
ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act
(as defined below) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this Section (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum
Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum
Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section shall apply to
a successor holder of this Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and
non-waivable. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of
Investor, Company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in
writing to Investor the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or
exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation,
pursuant to this Note. During the first six months, this Note is in effect, the
Investor may not convert this Note pursuant to this paragraph. The conversion
discount and look-back period will be adjusted downward (i.e. for the benefit of
the Holder) if the Company offers a more favorable conversion discount (whether
via interest rate, OID, lower ceiling price or otherwise) or look-back period to
another party while this note is in effect and the Holder will also get the
benefit of any other term (for a example a higher prepay) granted to any third
party while this Note is in effect. 

2.  
 (b)     Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this
Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid, by the
Company, in Common Stock ("Interest Shares"). Holder may send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such
notice. 

(c)     This Note may not be prepaid.  
 (d)     Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other
change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a
forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or
merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company
is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to
change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a
reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock
solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to as a "Sale Event"), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon
request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal
amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at
the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal amount
of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion
Price.  
 (e)     In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of
all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection with which this
Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision
to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by
converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number
of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable
upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change,
consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that
could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion
Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The
foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the
consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the
value shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or
successor person or entity acting in good faith.  
 5.     No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in
the form, herein prescribed.  
 6.     The Company hereby expressly waives demand and
presentment for payment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest,
notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and
diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called for hereunder and shall
be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be
owing hereto.  
 7.     The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the
Holder in collecting any amount due under this Note.  

8.     While this Note is outstanding and to the extent the
Company grants any other party more favorable investment terms (whether via
interest rate, original issue discount, conversion discount or look-back
period), the terms of the Note shall automatically adjust to match those more
favorable terms.  
 9. If
one or more of the following described "Events of Default" shall occur: 
 (a)     The Company shall default in the payment of
principal or interest on this Note or any other note issued to the Holder by the
Company; or 
 (b)     Any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company herein or in any certificate or financial or other written statements
heretofore or hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Note, or the Securities Purchase
Agreement under which this note was issued shall be false or misleading in any
respect; or 
 (c)     The Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any
respect, any covenant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation of
the Company under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or 
 (d)     The Company shall (1) become insolvent; (2) admit in
writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they mature; (3) make an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its
dissolution; (4) apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee,
liquidator or receiver for its or for a substantial part of its property or
business; (5) file a petition for relief, consent to the filing of such petition
or have filed against it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all
under federal or state laws as applicable; or 
 (e)     A trustee, liquidator or receiver shall be appointed
for the Company or for a substantial part of its property or business without
its consent and shall not be discharged within sixty (60) days after such
appointment; or 
 (f)     Any governmental agency or any court of competent
jurisdiction at the instance of any governmental agency shall assume custody or
control of the whole or any substantial portion of the properties or assets of
the Company; or 
 (g)     One or more money judgments, writs or warrants of
attachment, or similar process, in excess of Sixty Four Thousand Four Hundred
Dollars and Five Cents ($64,400.05) in the aggregate, shall be entered or filed
against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain
unpaid, unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in
any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of any proposed sale
thereunder; or  

(h)     The Company shall have defaulted on or breached any
term of any other note of similar debt instrument into which the Company has
entered and failed to cure such default within the appropriate grace period;
or 
 (i)     The Company shall have its Common Stock delisted
from an exchange (including the OTCBB exchange) or, if the Common Stock trades
on an exchange, then trading in the Common Stock shall be suspended for more
than 10 consecutive days; 
 (j)     If a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company on the date hereof are no longer serving as members of
the Board; 
 (k)     The Company shall not deliver to the Holder the
Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 4 herein without restrictive legend within 3
business days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion; or 
 (l)     The Company shall not replenish the reserve set
forth in Section 13, within 3 business days of the request of the Holder. If the
Company does not replenish, the request of the Holder then the conversion
discount set forth in Section 4(a) shall be increased from a 50% conversion
discount to a 60% conversion discount; or 
 (m)     The Company shall not be  current  in its filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission; or 
 (n)     The Company shall lose the  bid  price for its stock
in a market (including the OTC marketplace or other exchange).  
 (o)     The Company is in arrears for more than 30 days with
its Transfer Agent, the conversion discount shall be increased from 50% to 60%.
 
 (p)     A default has been declared against the Company,
which has not been cured in any other loan or Note agreement.  
 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any
period of grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's rights and remedies
provided herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event
of Default, interest shall accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum
or, if such rate is usurious or not permitted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach of Section
8(k) the penalty shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on
the 4 th  day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
This penalty shall increase to $500 per day beginning on the 10 th  day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an increase of the
outstanding principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), (k),
or (l) the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 50%. If
this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note
shall increase by 10%. Concord is waiving all defaults that would take effect
through entering this agreement through Jan 1, 2017. Any default, once cured,
will be considered a default going forward.  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as
follows: 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)] 
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
 10.    In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible,
so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.  
 11.    Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended,
waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by
the Company and the Holder.  
 12.    The Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and
has never been a  shell  issuer or that if it previously has been a  shell 
issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form
10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The
Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to
allow for salability of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from
Holder s counsel.  

13.    The Company shall reserve 472,000,000 shares of Common
Stock for conversions under this Note (the  Share Reserve ). The investor shall
have the right to periodically request that the number of Reserved Shares be
increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at least equals 400%   of
the number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the
shares. At all times, the reserve shall be maintained with the Transfer Agent at
four times the amount of shares required if the Note would be fully converted.
If the Company defaults on these terms, the conversion discount will increase to
60%.  
 14.    The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any
corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits,
recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as
possible under law. 
 15.    This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be
performed within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby mutually
waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
courts of the State of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement
shall be effective as an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

      are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

(b)  
     
       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
      management or other employees who have a significant role in the
