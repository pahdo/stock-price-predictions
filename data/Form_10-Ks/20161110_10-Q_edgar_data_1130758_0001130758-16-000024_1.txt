(1)   The condensed statements included herein have been prepared by the registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these condensed statements consist only of normal recurring adjustments.  Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the registrant believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the registrant's latest annual report on Form 10 K.

The Company's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc. ("AFM"), the Managing Member.  Robert P. Johnson, the President and sole director of AFM, serves as the Special Managing Member.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the majority shareholder.  AEI Fund Management, Inc. ("AEI"), an affiliate of AFM, performs the administrative and operating functions for the Company.

The terms of the offering called for a subscription price of $1,000 per LLC Unit, payable on acceptance of the offer.  The Company commenced operations on October 31, 2001 when minimum subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  The offering terminated May 17, 2003 when the extended offering period expired.  The Company received subscriptions for 24,831.283 Units.  Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Limited Members and Managing Members contributed funds of $24,831,283 and $1,000, respectively.  The Company shall continue until December 31, 2051, unless dissolved, terminated and liquidated prior to that date.

During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which the Managing Members determine to distribute will be distributed 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.  Distributions to Limited Members will be made pro rata by Units.

Any Net Proceeds of Sale, as defined, from the sale or financing of properties which the Managing Members determine to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves, be paid in the following manner: (i) first, 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members until the Limited Members receive an amount equal to: (a) their Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7% of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed from Net Cash Flow; (ii) any remaining balance will be distributed 90% to the Limited Members and 10% to the Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will be made pro rata by Units.

For tax purposes, profits from operations, other than profits attributable to the sale, exchange, financing, refinancing or other disposition of property, will be allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.  Net losses from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

Upon liquidation of the Company or withdrawal by a Managing Member, the Managing Members will contribute to the Company an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01% of the total capital contributions of the Limited Members over the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(3)  Note Receivable  

On May 19, 2010, as a result of the sale of the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Littleton, Colorado, the Company received a Note with a principal balance of $1,361,730 as a lease settlement payment from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of the tenant and guarantor of the Lease.  The interest rate on the Note was 7%.  The Note required interest only quarterly payments of $23,830 for two years and monthly payments of principal and interest of $12,242 for the next three years.

(3)  Note Receivable   (Continued)

Based on a review of Fired Up's payment history during the first quarter of 2013 and continued monitoring of its financial condition, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts against the Note Receivable.  As a result, a bad debt expense of $330,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Subsequently, Fired Up stopped making payments in October 2013.  As a result, an additional bad debt expense of $315,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.  On March 27, 2014, Fired Up filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, Fired Up owed $46,766 of past due interest, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  In July 2014, Fired Up reached a tentative agreement with the majority of its creditors on a reorganization plan.  After analyzing the terms of the tentative plan, the Company recognized additional bad debt expense of $270,000 in the second quarter of 2014.

The Company submitted a Proof of Claim for damages to the bankruptcy court.  The reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court effective February 2, 2015.  In early May 2015, the Company received an initial claim payment from the plan of $267,398.  Based on an updated claim payment estimate from the bankruptcy trustee, the Company recognized additional bad debt expense of $57,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.  At December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance due on the Note, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, was $50,826.  In February 2016, the Company received a final claim payment that covered the remaining net balance of the Note.

(4)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc.  

AEI Fund Management, Inc. performs the administrative and operating functions for the Company.  The payable to AEI Fund Management represents the balance due for those services.  This balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be paid in the normal course of business.

(5)  Members' Capital  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company declared distributions of $925,963 and $925,966, respectively.  The Limited Members received distributions of $900,002 and $900,005 and the Managing Members received distributions of $25,961 and $25,961 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Members' distributions represented $37.50 and $37.06 per LLC Unit outstanding using 23,998 and 24,288 weighted average Units in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distributions represented $14.68 and $15.11 per Unit of Net Income and $22.82 and $21.95 per Unit of return of contributed capital in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(5)  Members' Capital   (Continued)

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $90,909 in both 2016 and 2015.

On April 1, 2016, the Company repurchased a total of 119.50 Units for $76,138 from two Limited Members in accordance with the Operating Agreement.  On April 1, 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 44.59 Units for $26,419 from nine Limited Members.  The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest in the Company.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Managing Members received distributions of $2,355 and $817 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(6)  Fair Value Measurements  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters.  These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Company owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for Members; 

resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the Managing Members of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Company operate. 

Page 10 of 17  

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.  Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  It is possible that the carrying amount of the Company's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.

Management of the Company evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing member of the Company.

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Company records them in the financial statements at cost.  The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property.  Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods.  The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities.  Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases.  Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.

Page 11 of 17  

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease.  Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease.  These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease.  These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.

The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables.  If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.

Carrying Value of Properties

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.

Allocation of Expenses

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs.  They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating Agreement.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Results of Operations

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized rental income of $1,029,820 and $1,017,115, respectively.  In 2016, rental income increased due to rent increases on two properties.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties as of October 31, 2016, the Company expects to recognize rental income of approximately $1,378,000 and $1,394,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated parties of $133,361 and $156,167, respectively.  These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.  During the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $33,438 and $34,227, respectively.  These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized interest income of $2,866 and $2,994, respectively.

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations.  Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's cash balances decreased $17,418 as a result of distributions paid to the Members and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities, which was partially offset by a payment received on a note receivable.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company's cash balances increased $215,518 as a result of a payment received on a note receivable, which was partially offset by distributions paid to the Members and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $901,945 in 2015 to $933,504 in 2016 as a result of an increase in total rental and interest income in 2016 and a decrease in LLC administration and property management expenses in 2016, which were partially offset by net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses.

Page 13 of 17  

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Members and cash used to repurchase Units.  The Company declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.  The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter.  The Company may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company declared distributions of $925,963 and $925,966, respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale were allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.  The Limited Members received distributions of $900,002 and $900,005 and the Managing Members received distributions of $25,961 and $25,961 for the periods, respectively.

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds (from property sales completed in 2014) of $90,909 in both 2016 and 2015.  The Limited Members received distributions of $90,000 and the Managing Members received distributions of $909 for each year.  The Limited Members' distributions represented $3.75 and $3.71 per Unit for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will either be reinvested in additional property or distributed to the Members in the future.

The Company may repurchase Units from Limited Members who have tendered their Units to the Company.  Such Units may be acquired at a discount.  The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated with all other transfers of Units that have occurred since the beginning of the same calendar year (excluding Permitted Transfers as defined in the Operating Agreement), would exceed 2% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company.

On April 1, 2016, the Company repurchased a total of 119.50 Units for $76,138 from two Limited Members in accordance with the Operating Agreement.  On April 1, 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 44.59 Units for $26,419 from nine Limited Members.  The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest in the Company.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Managing Members received distributions of $2,355 and $817 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.
