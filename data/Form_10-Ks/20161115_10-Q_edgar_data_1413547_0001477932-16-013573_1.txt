Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows    (Unaudited)            The accompanying notes are an integral part of these unaudited consolidated financial statements.            WRIT MEDIA GROUP, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Organization and Business Operations       WRIT Media Group, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  WRIT  or the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs and similar entertainment programs for various media formats. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Front Row Networks, Inc., Amiga Games, Inc., and Retro Infinity, Inc.     Front Row Networks, Inc. is a content creation company which produces, acquires and distributes live concerts in 3D for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters, TV and mobile streaming providers.     On August 19, 2013, the Company acquired certain software through the purchase of 100% of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares. Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT s wholly-owned subsidiary.      Amiga Games Inc. licenses classic pre-Windows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern game consoles, PCs, tablets, and other television streaming devices.      WRIT also established a new company, Retro Infinity Inc., to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into the growing  retro gaming  marketplace, building on the "Amiga",  Atari , and  MS-DOS  brands, delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games.      On January 22, 2014, the Company changed the name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc.     On June 20, 2016, WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of 14,000,000 restricted shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all issued and outstanding shares of Pandora, making Pandora a wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.     On June 21, 2016 the Board of Directors of WRIT Media Group, Inc. appointed Boris Nayflish as an independent director to serve on the Board. The appointment was effective as of June 20, 2016. The Board was not required to increase its size due to the existence of vacancies on the Board at the time of appointment. The Board does not expect at this time that Mr. Nayflish will receive any cash or stock compensation as director.     The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of WRIT Media Group, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements as reported in the annual report on Form 10-K have been omitted.             NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN      As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,529,055 which includes a loss of $343,361 at September 30, 2016 and a working capital deficiency of $871,130. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from outcome of this uncertainty. Although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan, and is seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities will be successful.

Overview      WRIT Media Group, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our ,  WRIT , or the  Company ) was incorporated as Writers  Group Film Corp. in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs and similar entertainment programs for various media formats.     Front Row Networks ( FRN ) was incorporated on July 27, 2010 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a content creation company which was launched to produce, acquire, license, and distribute music-related content in 3D and ultra-high definition (4K) for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters. Through the distribution of music-related  alternative content,  the Company intends to present live concerts, music documentaries, and other music-related content at affordable prices, to a massive fan base worldwide in a cost-effective manner. The Company intends to shift its focus from 3D to developing ultra-high definition (4K) content for distribution in the Americas and Asia. In some cases, Front Row Networks will also sell merchandising and other products, bolstered by both in-theater and in-App advertising, tailored around each Artist and/or event, to maximize potential merchandising and sponsorship revenues.     In February 2011, FRN completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with WRIT, whereby WRIT acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FRN in exchange for 100,000 shares of the Common Stock of WRIT. As a result of the reverse acquisition, FRN became WRIT s wholly-owned subsidiary and the former FRN s shareholders became controlling stockholders of WRIT. The share exchange transaction with WRIT was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FRN as the accounting acquirer and WRIT as the acquired party.           Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Share Exchange Agreement were those of FRN and will be recorded at the historical cost basis. After the completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company s consolidated financial statements included the assets and liabilities of both FRN and WRIT, the historical operations of FRN and the operations of WRIT from the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement.     On July 7, 2011, we modified our February 2011 Share Exchange Agreement and agreed to assume $100,000 in new debt which is shown as a reduction of our Paid-In Capital.     While the core business of Front Row Networks remains the licensing, production, acquisition and distribution of music-related content and programming, the core business is dependent upon negotiating and financing projects with schedules that are solely determined by third parties, such as Artists and rights owners. In order to secure less cyclical entertainment product, the Company sought to license or purchase entertainment content that could be easily secured and distributed through the multiple distribution arrangements already established by the Company and via the rapidly growing marketplace represented by consumers of mobile, internet, and TV set-top devices. To reach this goal during the fiscal year, the Company set out to acquire exclusive branded content and entertainment programming, and achieved this goal through the acquisition of Amiga Games Inc.      On August 19, 2013, the Company completed an acquisition transaction through a share exchange with Amiga Games Inc., whereby WRIT acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock, assets, and trademarks of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares of the Common Stock of WRIT. As a result of the acquisition, Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT s wholly-owned subsidiary.      Amiga Games Inc. licenses classic pre-Windows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern game consoles, PCs, tablets, and other television streaming devices. WRIT also established a new company, Retro Infinity Inc., to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into the growing  retro gaming  marketplace, building on the "Amiga",  Atari , and  MS-DOS  brands, delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games.      During the 2014 fiscal year, Amiga Games Inc. and Retro Infinity Inc. entered several marketing and distribution agreements, including those with Microsoft Corporation and Roku Inc. Both agreements include minimum guarantees, defined as advances against future sales. Additionally, the Retro Infinity Inc. licensed dozens of classic games for distribution via the Windows 8, Roku player, iOS (Apple), and Android platforms. Although it was the Company s strategic goal to distribute a broad range of video game titles on the Windows 8 and iOS platforms during the 4th quarter of 2014, lack of operating capital caused the Company to temporarily halt software development funding, which delayed the Company s overall gaming product release schedule. This temporary reduction in operating capital was due to mainly to regulatory delays encountered in structuring WRIT s equity-line financing, and the Company s difficulty in raising alternative investment capital, due to its sub-penny share price at the time.     On January 22, 2014, the Company changed the name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc., and authorized a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The name change was authorized to encompass the Company's broadened activities, including additional business plans and models, and the acquisition and formation of new subsidiaries. The equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d) listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies.            On January 16, 2014 WRIT s Equity Line Financing ( ELF ) agreement with Dutchess Opportunity Fund II, and its corresponding S1 registration statement, was declared effective by the SEC. The ELF agreement, executed in September 2013, allows but does not require WRIT to sell up to US$10,000,000 of common stock to Dutchess at a 5% discount to market price, during the 36 month term. Compared to the Company s convertible debt financing, ELFs provide a lower discount to market that minimize dilution while increasing operating capital. This additional financing source allowed the company to reduce debt and reduce the balance of the more expensive convertible notes that were outstanding during the last quarter of the fiscal year.      On February 4, 2014 the Company completed its administrative and legal work with the Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") and the DTCC's long-standing "Administrative Chill" on clearing WRIT stock certificates was removed. DTCC resumed accepting deposits of the Company's common stock for book entry transfer services. As a result, shareholders with online brokerage accounts at firms such as Scottrade, ETRADE, TD Ameritrade and other full service brokerage firms are allowed to deposit new shares of WRIT's common stock in the electronic system that controls clearance and settlement. The reinstatement of the DTC depository services is an instrumental and enormous accomplishment for WRIT, which greatly reduced the costs and expenses associated with private equity investments in the Company.     In September 2014 the Company launched two online point of sale platforms; www.RetroInfinity.com and www.AmigaGamesInc.com to market its  retro  gaming titles directly to consumers. Both sales platforms initially offer only downloads for windows based computers. The online store launch was completed in conjunction with an initial marketing program which featured NASCAR, the RWR Retro Infinity NASCAR race team, and the  Drive to Championship Weekend  branding program. In December 2014 the Company intended to launch additional titles on additional mobile platforms, such as Windows phone, iOS, and Android platforms, so that the video game titles can be downloaded as Apps on various mobile devices, the Company experienced additional financing delays which interrupted software development and caused the Company to reschedule the anticipated release on mobile platforms into 2015. The online store launch generated an increase in consumer traffic to the Company s websites and created awareness in the Company s product, but generated minimal sales, most consumers were interested only in the mobile versions of the gaming titles, which were not yet available.      The websites are currently being modified to accept payment for crowdfunding transactions, and we launched the Retro Infinity/Amiga Games crowdfunding platform, supported by a social marketing campaign, in the 3rd quarter of 2015. The initial crowdfunding campaign was not successful, so the Company is seeking additional financing from strategic partners that will allow the Company to resume and complete software development, and commence product marketing activities.      On June 25, 2015, the Company authorized a 1 for 200 reverse split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d) listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies.      On June 20, 2016 WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired all assets, trademarks and common stock of Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company through a share exchange agreement. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of 14,000,000 restricted shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Pandora, making Pandora a wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.     We believe WRIT is well positioned to benefit from the developing market and growth in digital currency trading platforms and products, and block chain technology applications, and intend to continue to look for opportunities to explore business relationships with entities that have the resources to offer financing, licensing, distribution and marketing of WRIT s product.

Obligations under Material Contracts      Except with respect to the loan obligations disclosed above, we have no obligations to pay cash or deliver cash to any other party.      Inflation      Inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost controls in operations.      Off Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities.      Seasonality      Our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction.      Critical Accounting Policies      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:       Long Lived Assets       In accordance with ASC 360 "Property Plant and Equipment," the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.            Recent Accounting Pronouncements      We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. See our discussion at  Item 9A Controls and Procedures  on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.      We have noted the following material weaknesses in our control environment:      1.  Material weaknesses in Our Control Environment.  Our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the organization. This material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal control which affect our control environment, including: a) the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the identification of fraud risks; b) the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls; c) and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures as of September 30, 2016.     2.  Material weaknesses in the staffing of our financial accounting department.  Management had engaged an outside consultant to assist in the financial reporting. However, the number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.     3.  Material weaknesses in Segregation of Duties.  The limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have independent review and approval of financial accounting entries. Furthermore, management and financial accounting personnel have wide-spread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, due to insufficient segregation of duties. Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing.     Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.       Changes in Internal Controls      There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.            LEGAL PROCEEDINGS      On July 21, 2016, Magna Equities II, LLC and Hanover Holdings I, LLC (collectively as  Magna ) filed a Summons with Notice of Appearance against the Company, and its former and current transfer agents (collectively as the  Parties ), in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery has commenced. Magna s allegations against the Parties, which are briefly outlined in the summons, are to recover monetary damages related to Magna s loan to the Company which has a principal balance equal to $85,750. Magna alleges breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and negligence against the Parties and seeks relief in excess of $1,500,000. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.     On August 17, 2016, KBM Worldwide Inc. ( KBM ) filed a Summons in a Civil Action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages, the Company has filed an answer to the complaint and a first counterclaim against the plaintiffs on November 1, 2016. KBM s allegations which are briefly outlined in the summons, are to recover monetary damages related to KBM s loans to the Company which have a principal balance equal to $142,765. KBM seeks equitable and injunctive relief against the Parties in excess of $142,765. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of its case against the plaintiff, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.     On July 27, 2016, Mr. George Sharp filed suit against the company in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Sharp had previously filed a similar lawsuit in 2011 which was dismissed on February 16, 2012, and included a settlement agreement signed by Sharp which was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (Case Number: BC461550) Sharp alleges misrepresentation and violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act, and seeks unspecified damages. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery has commenced. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.
