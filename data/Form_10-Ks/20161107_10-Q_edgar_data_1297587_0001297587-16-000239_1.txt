1. Business and Organization 
  Gramercy Property Trust, or the Company or Gramercy, a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a leading global investor and asset manager of commercial real estate. Gramercy specializes in acquiring and managing single-tenant, net leased industrial, office, and specialty properties. The Company focuses on income producing properties leased to high quality tenants in major markets in the United States and Europe. 
  Gramercy earns revenues primarily through rental revenues on properties that it owns in the United States and asset management revenues on properties owned by third parties in the United States and Europe. The Company also owns unconsolidated equity investments in the United States, Europe, and Asia. 
  On December 17, 2015, Chambers Street Properties, or Chambers, a Maryland REIT, completed a merger, or the Merger, with Gramercy Property Trust Inc., or Legacy Gramercy, a Maryland corporation, pursuant to which Legacy Gramercy stockholders received   3.1898   common shares of beneficial interest of Chambers for each share of common stock of Legacy Gramercy held. Following the Merger, Chambers changed its name to  Gramercy Property Trust  and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, using the  GPT  stock symbol.   
  In the Merger, Chambers was the legal acquirer and Legacy Gramercy was the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the financial information set forth herein subsequent to the close of the Merger on December 17, 2015 reflects results of the combined company, and financial information prior to the close of the Merger reflects Legacy Gramercy results. For this reason, period to period comparisons may not be meaningful. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Merger. 
  Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to  Company,   Gramercy,   we,   our,  and  us  mean Legacy Gramercy and one or more of its subsidiaries for the periods prior to the Merger closing and Gramercy Property Trust and one or more of its subsidiaries for periods following the Merger closing. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s wholly-owned portfolio consists of   295   properties comprising   53,306,568   rentable square feet with   98.5%   occupancy. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has ownership interests in   46   industrial and office properties with   97.6%   occupancy, which are held in unconsolidated equity investments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s asset management business, which operates under the name Gramercy Asset Management, manages for third parties approximately     $1,200,000     of commercial real estate assets, including approximately   $871,000   of assets in Europe. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company and TPG Real Estate, or TPG, partnered to form Strategic Office Partners, an unconsolidated equity investment that will invest in single-tenant office properties in the United States. The Company contributed   six   properties to Strategic Office Partners valued at   $187,500   and, in exchange, the Company received cash proceeds of   $140,625  , equivalent to TPG s   75.0%   interest in the venture, plus a   25.0%   interest in Strategic Office Partners valued at   $46,608  . Concurrently with the initial funding of Strategic Office Partners, the Company received a distribution of   $30,581   representing its pro rata share of loan proceeds, resulting in an initial equity investment of   $16,027  .  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   16   properties aggregating   2,795,476   square feet for a total purchase price of approximately   $237,432  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   48   properties aggregating   11,464,734   square feet for a total purchase price of approximately   $862,341  . Additionally, on June 30, 2016, the Company received   100.0%   ownership of   seven   properties previously held in its joint venture with Duke Realty Corporation through a distribution of real estate assets by the joint venture, which had an aggregate   4,189,630   square feet and total fair value of   $276,100  .   
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold   ten   properties aggregating   2,435,130   square feet for total gross proceeds of approximately   $394,241  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold   20   properties aggregating   5,070,129   square feet for total gross proceeds of approximately   $1,041,941  . Of the properties sold during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   six   properties comprising an aggregate   980,825   square feet and with total value of   $187,500   were contributed to Strategic Office Partners. Additionally, on June 30, 2016, the Company sold   74.9%   of its   80.0%   interest in its European joint venture with the Goodman Group to its unconsolidated equity investment in Europe, Gramercy Property Europe plc, or the Gramercy European Property Fund, for gross proceeds of   $148,884   (   134,336  ).

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, if any, to its shareholders. The Company has in the past established, and may in the future establish taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, to effect various taxable transactions. Those TRSs would incur U.S. federal, state and local taxes on the taxable income from their activities.  
  The Company s operating partnership, GPT Operating Partnership LP, or the Operating Partnership, indirectly owns (i) all of the Company s consolidated real estate investments, (ii) the Company s interests in unconsolidated equity investments and (iii) the entities, primarily a TRS, that conduct the Company s third-party asset management operations. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. In April 2016, the common units of limited partnership interest in Legacy Gramercy s operating partnership were exchanged for common units of limited partnership interest in GPT Operating Partnership LP, or OP Units, and the Company s partnership agreement was amended and restated to reflect the exchange, or the Fourth Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. The Operating Partnership is the   100.0%   owner of all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, except that, as of   September 30, 2016  , third-party holders of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership owned approximately   0.22%   of the beneficial interest of the Company. These interests are referred to as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. See Note   12   for more information on the Company s noncontrolling interests. 
   
  2  . Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In management s opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The 2016 operating results for the period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuances Costs, which requires the Company to reclassify debt financing costs, which were previously accounted for on the deferred costs line within the asset section, and present them in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability, with the exception of deferred financing costs associated with the credit facility which remain in deferred costs in the asset section on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred financing costs totaling   $6,389   have been reclassified in the   December 31, 2015   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet from the deferred costs line and netted against the corresponding debt liability. See  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  below for further discussion of the new accounting guidance for deferred financing costs. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company s accounts and those of the Company s subsidiaries which are wholly-owned or controlled by the Company, or entities which are variable interest entities, or VIEs, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the VIE s anticipated losses and/or a majority of the expected returns. The Company has evaluated its investments for potential classification as variable interests by evaluating the sufficiency of each entity s equity investment at risk to absorb losses. 
  Entities which the Company does not control and are considered VIEs, but where the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The equity interests of other limited partners in the Company s Operating Partnership are reflected as noncontrolling interests.

Real Estate Investments 
  The Company records acquired real estate investments as business combinations when the real estate is occupied, at least in part, at acquisition. Costs directly related to the acquisition of such investments are expensed as incurred. The Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to land, building, improvements and intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases, and origination costs associated with the in-place leases at the acquisition date. The values of the above- and below-market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase, in the case of below-market leases, or a decrease, in the case of above-market leases, to rental revenue over the remaining term of the associated lease. The values associated with in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the associated lease. 
  The Company assesses the fair value of the leases at acquisition based upon estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.  Additionally, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase at the time of acquisition. 
  Acquired real estate investments involving sale-leasebacks that have newly-originated leases are recorded as asset acquisitions and accordingly, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition are capitalized. Acquired real estate investments which are under construction are considered build-to-suit transactions and other acquired real estate investments that do not meet the definition of a business combination are recorded at cost. In build-to-suit transactions, the Company engages a developer to construct a property or provides funds to a tenant to develop a property. The Company capitalizes the funds provided to the developer/tenant and real estate taxes, if applicable, during the construction period. 
  Certain improvements are capitalized when they are determined to increase the useful life of the building. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life at acquisition of the capitalized item or   40   years for buildings,   five   to   ten years   for building equipment and fixtures, and the lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. 
  In leasing space, the Company may provide funding to the lessee through a tenant allowance. If the Company is considered the owner of the leasehold improvements constructed using a tenant allowance, the Company capitalizes the amount of the allowance and depreciates it over the shorter of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the lease term. If the tenant allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or if the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements for accounting purposes, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of rental revenue.  
  The Company reviews the recoverability of a property s carrying value when circumstances indicate a possible impairment in the value of a property, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. If management determines impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used and for assets held for sale, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value less estimated cost of disposal. The estimated fair value of the asset becomes its new cost basis and if the asset is to be held and used, the new cost basis will be depreciated or amortized over its remaining useful life. 
  Intangible Assets and Liabilities 
  The Company follows the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets include land, buildings and improvements on an as-if vacant basis and identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquired leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and above-market and below-market ground rent intangibles.

The above- and below-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of and increase to rental revenue, respectively, over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The value of in-place leases is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining non-cancelable term of the respective leases. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, the Company amortizes such below-market lease value into rental revenue over the renewal period. If a tenant terminates its lease prior to its contractual expiration and no future rental payments will be received, any unamortized balance of the market lease intangibles will be written off to rental revenue and any unamortized balance of the in-place lease intangibles will be written off to depreciation and amortization expense. The above- and below-market ground rent intangible values are amortized as a reduction of and increase to rent expense, respectively, over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. If the Company terminates its lease prior to its contractual expiration and no future rent payments will be paid, any unamortized balance of the ground rent intangibles will be written off to rent expense. 
  Intangible assets and liabilities consist of the following: 

The following table provides the weighted-average amortization period as of   September 30, 2016   for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense for the next five years.

  September 30, 2016 

The Company recorded   $29,670   and   $9,808     of amortization of in-place lease intangible assets as part of depreciation and amortization for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded   $86,845   and   $27,947   of amortization of in-place lease intangible assets as part of depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded   $4,578   and   $4,309     of amortization of market lease intangible assets and liabilities as an increase to rental revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded   $10,388   and   $10,359   of amortization of market lease intangible assets and liabilities as an increase to rental revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded   $8   and   $(1)   of amortization of ground rent intangible assets and liabilities as part of other property operating expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded   $25   and   $(41)   of amortization of ground rent intangible assets and liabilities as part of other property operating expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the fair value of the collaboration expected to be achieved upon consummation of a business combination and is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at acquisition date. The Company initially recognized goodwill of   $3,887   related to the acquisition of Gramercy Europe Limited, or Gramercy Europe Asset Management, however during the second quarter of 2015, as a result of finalization of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, the Company decreased the amount allocated to goodwill by   $85   and thus the final purchase price allocation to goodwill as a result of the acquisition was   $3,802  . The adjustment to goodwill for the finalized purchase price was primarily related to a reduction in the contract intangible value as well as an increase in the accrued income recorded for incentive fees. The carrying value of goodwill is adjusted each reporting period for the effect of foreign currency translation adjustments. The carrying value of goodwill at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $3,141   and   $3,568  , respectively. The Company s goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company takes a qualitative approach to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test. The Company did not record any impairment on its goodwill during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  Unconsolidated Equity Investments 
  The Company accounts for   substantially all of its unconsolidated equity investments   under the equity method of accounting since it exercises significant influence, but does not unilaterally control the entities, and is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.     In unconsolidated equity investments, the rights of the other investors are protective and participating. Unless the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, these rights preclude it from consolidating the investments. The investments are recorded initially at cost as unconsolidated equity investments, as applicable, and subsequently are adjusted for equity interest in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. The amount of the investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets is evaluated for impairment at each reporting period. None of the unconsolidated equity investment debt is recourse to the Company. Transactions with unconsolidated equity method entities are eliminated to the extent of the Company s ownership in each such entity. Accordingly, the Company s share of net income (loss) of these equity method entities is included in consolidated net income (loss).  
  The Company s   5.07%   unconsolidated equity investment in CBRE Strategic Partners Asia, described more in Note 5, is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at fair value. CBRE Strategic Partners Asia is an investment company that accounts for its investments at fair value with changes in the fair value of the investments recorded in the statement of operations. See the  Fair Value Measurements  section of this Note 2 as well as Note   9  ,    Fair Value Measurements,  for further discussion of the fair value accounting methodology used for CBRE Strategic Partners Asia. 
  Carrying values of the Company s unconsolidated equity investments were   $120,176   and   $580,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash 
  The Company had restricted cash of   $171,895   and   $17,354   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which primarily consists of proceeds from property sales held by qualified intermediaries to be used for tax-deferred, like-kind exchanges under IRC Section 1031, as well as reserves for certain capital improvements, leasing, interest and real estate tax and insurance payments as required by certain mortgage loan obligations. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which modified the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Under the revised guidance, the Company s operating partnerships, including both GPT Operating Partnership, or the Operating Partnership, and Gramercy Operating Partnership, which is Legacy Gramercy s operating partnership, were determined to be VIEs, for which the Company was the primary beneficiary due to its majority ownership and ability to exercise control over every aspect of the partnerships  operations. Because the operating partnerships were already consolidated in the Company s balance sheets, the revised guidance had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no other legal entities qualifying under the scope of the revised guidance that were consolidated as a result of the adoption. In addition, there were no voting interest entities under prior existing guidance that were determined to be VIEs under the revised guidance. Following the adoption of the Company s Fourth Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, which was effective in April 2016, the Company s Operating Partnership became its active operating partnership entity and Legacy Gramercy s operating partnership became a disregarded entity. The assets and liabilities of the Company and its Operating Partnership are substantially the same, as the Company does not have any significant assets other than its investments in the Operating Partnership. All of the Company's debt is also an obligation of the Operating Partnership. 
  The Company had   three   consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   two   consolidated VIEs as of   December 31, 2015  . The Company had   four   unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The following is a summary of the Company s involvement with VIEs as of   September 30, 2016  :

The following is a summary of the Company s involvement with VIEs as of   December 31, 2015  : 

Consol  idated VIEs 
  Proportion Foods 
  In December 2015, the Company entered into a non-recourse financing arrangement with Big Proportion Austin LLC, or BIG, for a build-to-suit industrial property in Round Rock, Texas. Concurrently, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement with BIG, pursuant to which the Company will acquire the property, which is   100.0%   leased to Proportion Foods, or Proportion Foods, upon substantial completion of the facility s development. The Company has determined that Proportion Foods is a VIE, as the equity holders of the entity do not have controlling financial interests and the obligation to absorb losses. The Company controls the activities that most significantly affect the economic outcome of Proportion Foods through its financing arrangement to fund the property s development and its forward purchase agreement with BIG. As such, the Company has concluded that it is the entity s primary beneficiary and has consolidated the VIE. The Company has a note receivable from BIG related to the financing arrangement, which is a note payable for BIG and thus eliminates upon consolidation of the VIE. 
  The construction of the facility on the property is expected to be completed in December 2016 and the Company has committed   $24,950   in financing for the construction. BIG is responsible for funding in excess of the   $24,950   mortgage note. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has funded   $12,849   for the property.  
  Gramercy Europe Asset Management (European Fund Manager) 
  In connection with the Company s December 2014 investment in the Gramercy European Property Fund, the Company acquired equity interests in the entity, hereinafter European Fund Manager, which provides investment and asset management services to the Gramercy European Property Fund. The Company has determined that European Fund Manager is a VIE, as the equity holders of that entity do not have controlling financial interests and the obligation to absorb losses. As Gramercy Europe Asset Management, through an investment advisory agreement with the VIE, controls the activities that most significantly affect the economic outcome of European Fund Manager, the Company has concluded that it is the entity s primary beneficiary and has consolidated the VIE. 
  European Fund Manager is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Company in the form of management fees in the future, however, if the VIE s cash inflows are not sufficient to cover its obligations, the Company may provide financial support for the VIE.  
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
  Gramercy Europe Asset Management (European Fund Carry Co.) 
  In connection with the Company s December 2014 investment in the Gramercy European Property Fund, the Company acquired equity interests in the entity, hereinafter European Fund Carry Co., entitled to receive certain

preferential distributions, if any, made from time-to-time by the Gramercy European Property Fund. The Company has determined that European Fund Carry Co. is a VIE, as the equity holders of the entity do not have controlling financial interests and the obligation to absorb losses. Decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of European Fund Carry Co. are decided by a majority vote of the VIE s shareholders. As such, the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and has accounted for it as an equity investment. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , European Fund Carry Co. had net assets of   $37   and   $(5)  .  
  Investment in Retained CDO Bonds 
  The Company holds non-investment grade subordinate bonds, preferred shares and ordinary shares of three collateralized debt obligations, or the Retained CDO Bonds, which it recognized subsequent to the disposal of its Gramercy Finance segment, or Gramercy Finance, and exit from the commercial real estate finance business in March 2013. The Company is not obligated to provide any financial support to these collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. The Company s maximum exposure to loss is limited to its interest in the Retained CDO Bonds and the Company does not control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance. 
  Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   one   and   six   assets classified as held for sale, respectively, which represent Chambers properties that qualified as held for sale as of the closing date of the Merger and are included within discontinued operations, in accordance with ASC 360, as these assets acquired in the Merger do not align with the Company s investment strategy and therefore will be sold. Real estate investments to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Once an asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization expense is no longer recorded. Refer to Note   3   for further information on the Company s assets held for sale and discontinued operations. 
  Tenant and Other Receivables 
  Tenant and other receivables are derived from management fees, rental revenue and tenant reimbursements.  
  Management fees, including incentive management fees, are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of the management agreements. The management agreements may contain provisions for fees related to dispositions, administration of the assets including fees related to accounting, valuation and legal services, and management of capital improvements or projects on the underlying assets. 
  Rental revenue is recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since many leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that will only be received if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. Tenant and other receivables also include receivables related to tenant reimbursements for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses that are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. 
  Tenant and other receivables are recorded net of the allowances for doubtful accounts, which as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $43   and   $204  , respectively. The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent, tenant reimbursements, and management fees, including incentive fees, and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant or asset management client s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant or asset management client, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant or asset management client operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property or asset management client is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company increases the allowance for doubtful accounts or records a direct write-off of the receivable. 
  Deferred Costs 
  Deferred costs consist of deferred financing costs, deferred acquisition costs, and deferred leasing costs. Deferred costs are presented net of accumulated amortization.  
  The Company s deferred financing costs are comprised of costs associated with the Company s unsecured credit facilities and include commitment fees, issuance costs, and legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining

the related financing. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line or effective interest basis over the contractual terms of the respective agreements and the amortization is reflected as interest expense. Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred financing costs on the balance sheet and reclassified amounts from the deferred costs line pertaining to debt arrangements other than its unsecured credit facilities, that were within the asset section, to instead be netted against the corresponding debt liability for all periods presented. See  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  below for further discussion of the new accounting guidance on deferred financing costs. 
  The Company s deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of lease inducement fees paid to secure acquisitions and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term as a reduction of rental revenue. 
  The Company s deferred leasing costs include direct costs, such as lease commissions, incurred to initiate and renew operating leases and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term as a reduction from rental revenue. 
  Fair Value Measurements  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company measured its Retained CDO Bonds, derivative instruments, and CBRE Strategic Partners Asia on a recurring basis and measured its real estate investments classified as held for sale at Merger closing on a non-recurring basis. ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  among other things, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair values. Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of these assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The level of pricing observability generally correlates to the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities. The investment manager of CBRE Strategic Partners Asia applies valuation techniques for the Company s investment carried at fair value based upon the application of the income approach, the direct market comparison approach, the replacement cost approach or third-party appraisals to the underlying assets held in the unconsolidated entity in determining the net asset value attributable to the Company s ownership interest therein. The three broad levels defined are as follows: 
  Level I     This level is comprised of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities that have quoted prices that are available in liquid markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
  Level II     This level is comprised of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities for which quoted prices are available but which are traded less frequently and instruments that are measured at fair value using management s judgment, where the inputs into the determination of fair value can be directly observed.  
  Level III     This level is comprised of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments do not have active markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment and assumptions.  
  For further discussion regarding fair value measurements see Note   9  ,  Fair Value Measurements.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Rental revenue from leases on real estate investments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, regardless of when payments are contractually due. The excess of rental revenue recognized over the amounts contractually due according to the underlying leases are included in deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For leases on properties that are under construction at the time of acquisition, the Company begins recognition of rental revenue upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant.

The Company s lease agreements with tenants also generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse the Company for real estate taxes, insurance costs, common area maintenance costs, and other property-related expenses. Under lease arrangements in which the Company is the primary obligor for these expenses, such amounts are recognized as both revenues and operating expenses for the Company. Under lease arrangements in which the tenant pays these expenses directly, such amounts are not included in revenues or expenses. These reimbursement amounts are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred. 
  The Company recognizes sales of real estate properties only upon closing. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits. Profit on real estate sold is recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured and the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale. Profit may be deferred in whole or part until the sale meets the requirements of profit recognition on sale of real estate. 
  Asset Management Business 
  The Company s asset and property management agreements may contain provisions for fees related to dispositions, administration of the assets including fees related to accounting, valuation and legal services, and management of capital improvements or projects on the underlying assets. The Company recognizes revenue for fees pursuant to its management agreements in the period in which they are earned. Management fees received prior to the date earned are included in deferred revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Certain of the Company s asset management contracts include provisions that may allow it to earn additional fees, generally described as incentive fees or profit participation interests, based on the achievement of a targeted valuation of the managed assets or the achievement of a certain internal rate of return on the managed assets. The Company recognizes incentive fees on its asset management contracts based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the contract, if the contract were terminated at the reporting date. If the contract may be terminated at will, revenue will only be recognized for the amount that would be due pursuant to that termination. If the incentive fee is a fixed amount, only a proportionate share of revenue is recognized at the reporting date, with the remaining fees recognized on a straight-line basis over the measurement period. The values of incentive management fees are periodically evaluated by management. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized incentive fees of   $2,931   and   $18,121  , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized incentive fees of   $111   and   $3,082  , respectively. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, concurrent with the formation of Strategic Office Partners, the Company entered into property management and leasing agreements with the venture, which provide for fees related to property management, property management, and leasing services. Additionally, the Company will receive an asset management fee of   0.35%   of aggregate purchase price as well as a   5.0%   promoted interest after achieving an internal rate of return of   13.5%   from our investment in Strategic Office Partners. 
  Investment and Other Income 
  Investment income consists primarily of income accretion on the Company s Retained CDO Bonds, which are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis using a discounted cash flow model, as well as realized foreign currency exchange gains (losses). 
  Share-Based Compensation Plans 
  The Company has share-based compensation plans, described more fully in Note   11  . The Company accounts for share-based awards using the fair value recognition provisions. Awards of shares or restricted shares are expensed as compensation over the benefit period and may require inputs that are highly subjective and require significant management judgment and analysis to develop. The Company assumes a forfeiture rate which impacts the amount of aggregate compensation cost recognized. In accordance with the provisions of the Company s share-based compensation plans, the Company accepts the return of its common shares at the current quoted market price to satisfy minimum statutory tax-withholding requirements related to shares that vested during the period. The Company also grants awards pursuant to its share-based compensation plans in the form of limited partnership interests in the Company s Operating Partnership, or LTIP Units.

Foreign Currency 
  Gramercy Europe Asset Management operates an asset and property management business located in the United Kingdom. The Company owns   one   property located in the United Kingdom,   two   properties in Canada, and has unconsolidated equity investments in Europe and Asia. The Company also has outstanding borrowings denominated in euros and British pounds sterling under the multicurrency portion of its revolving credit facility. Refer to Note   5   for more information on the Company s foreign unconsolidated equity investments.  
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The Company has interests in Europe and Canada, for which the functional currencies are the euro, the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. The Company performs the translation from the euro, the British pound sterling or the Canadian dollar, to the U.S. dollar for assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenues and expenses using a weighted-average exchange rate during the period. The Company reports the gains and losses resulting from such translation as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recorded net translation gains (losses) of   $(1,120)   and   $(3,687)   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company recorded a net translation loss of   $(360)   and   $(309)   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These translation gains and losses are reclassified to earnings when the Company has substantially exited from all investments in the related currency. 
  Foreign Currency Transactions 
  A transaction gain or loss realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction will be included in earnings during the period in which the transaction is settled. Foreign currency intercompany transactions that are scheduled for settlement are included in the determination of net income. 
  Intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term nature that do not have a planned or foreseeable future settlement date, and in which the entities to the transactions are consolidated or accounted for by the equity method in the Company s financial statements, are not included in net income but are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). 
  Net realized gains (losses) are recognized on foreign currency transactions in connection with the transfer of cash between foreign operations of subsidiaries or equity investments and the parent company. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized net realized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of   $185   and   $104  , respectively, on such transactions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized net realized foreign currency transaction losses of   $15   and   $25  , respectively, on such transactions.

Derivatives and Non-Derivative Hedging Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes. The Company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives and non-derivative net investment hedges. The Company uses a variety of derivative instruments that are considered  plain vanilla  derivatives to manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. The Company enters into derivative and hedging instruments that will be maximally effective in reducing the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. This effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract. The Company s derivatives and non-derivative hedging instruments typically include interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, foreign currency forward contracts, as well as non-derivative net investment hedges. The Company expressly prohibits the use of unconventional derivative instruments and the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. 
  The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative accounting may increase or decrease reported net income and shareholders  equity prospectively, depending on future levels of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, swap spreads, foreign exchange rates, and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows, provided the contract is carried through to full term.  
  The Company s non-derivative hedging instrument, the multicurrency tranche of the Company s 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, is reported at carrying value on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Company s non-derivative net investment hedges are denominated in euros and British pounds sterling, the Company translates the carrying value of the hedges from foreign currency into its functional and reporting currency of U.S. dollars at the period-ending rate and reports this value in its financial statements, with the foreign currency translation adjustments associated with the hedged net investments reported in the cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Note   10   for more information on the Company s derivatives and non-derivative hedging instruments. 
  Other Assets 
  The Company makes payments for certain expenses such as insurance and property taxes in advance of the period in which it receives the benefit. These payments are classified as other assets and amortized over the respective period of benefit relating to the contractual arrangement. Other assets also includes deposits related to pending acquisitions and financing arrangements, as required by a seller or lender, respectively. Additionally, other assets includes costs of software purchased for internal use and as well as the value of contracts assumed by the Company pursuant to a business combination, such as asset or property management contracts. 
  Servicing Advances Receivable 
  The Company s servicing advances receivable consisted of its accrual for the reimbursement of servicing advances, including expenses such as legal fees and professional fees incurred while the Company was the collateral manager of the CDOs, which were recognized as part of the disposal of Gramercy Finance in March 2013. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received reimbursements from servicing advances of   $1,390  . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not receive any reimbursements. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   servicing advances receivable and as of   December 31, 2015  , there were servicing advances receivable of   $1,382  . All servicing advances were received as of March 30, 2016, thus there will be no future activity related to servicing advances.

Retained CDO Bonds 
  The Company recognized its Retained CDO Bonds at fair value in March 2013 subsequent to the disposal of Gramercy Finance. Management estimated the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and recognized an investment in the Retained CDO Bonds equal to the net present value of these discounted cash flows. There is no guarantee that the Company will realize any proceeds from this investment, or what the timing will be for the expected remaining life of the Retained CDO Bonds. The Company considers these investments to be not of high credit quality and does not expect a full recovery of interest and principal. Therefore, the Company has suspended interest income accruals on these investments. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the Retained CDO Bonds to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these investments, if any, reflect a decline in value which is other-than-temporary. If there is a decrease in estimated cash flows and the investment is in an unrealized loss position, the Company will record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. To determine the component of the OTTI related to expected credit losses, the Company compares the amortized cost basis of the Retained CDO Bonds to the present value of the revised expected cash flows, discounted using the pre-impairment yield. Conversely, if the security is in an unrealized gain position and there is a decrease or significant increase in expected cash flows, the Company will prospectively adjust the yield using the effective yield method. Refer to Note   9   for further discussion regarding the fair value measurement of the Retained CDO Bonds. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recognized   no     OTTI on its Retained CDO Bonds. 
  A summary of the Company s Retained CDO Bonds as of   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

The following table summarizes the activity related to credit losses on the Retained CDO Bonds for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the year ended December 31,   2015  :

Income Taxes 
  The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90.0% of its ordinary taxable income, to shareholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that the Company distributes to its shareholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will then be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants the Company relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect the Company s net income and net cash available for distributions to shareholders. However, the Company believes that it will be organized and will operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and the Company intends to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner so that it will qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. The Company s TRSs are subject to federal, state and local taxes. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $331   and   $3,734   of income tax expense, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded   $985   and   $2,116   of income tax expense, respectively. Tax expense for each year is comprised of federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. Income taxes, primarily related to the Company s TRSs, are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance is included in the tax provision when such a change occurs. 
  The Company s policy for interest and penalties, if any, on material uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements is to classify these as interest expense and operating expense, respectively.  
  Earnings Per Share 
  The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share, or EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilutive instruments and is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding during the period. The Company has adopted the two-class computation method, and thus includes all participating securities in the computation of basic shares for the periods in which the Company has net income avail  a  ble to common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares, as long as their inclusion would not be anti-dilutive. Refer to Note   11   for further discussion of the computation of EPS. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments, debt investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash investments in excess of insured amounts with high quality financial institutions.

Concentrations of credit risk also arise when a number of the Company s tenants or asset management clients are engaged in similar business activities or are subject to similar economic risks or conditions that could cause their inability to meet contractual obligations to the Company. The Company regularly monitors its portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risk. Management believes the current credit risk portfolio is reasonably well diversified.   Asset management clients KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., or KBS, and Gramercy Europe Asset Management accounted for   82.8%   and   15.9%   of the Company s management fee income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and KBS accounted for   90.5%   of the Company s management fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. KBS and Gramercy Europe Asset Management accounted for   81.1%   and   10.4%   of the Company s management fee income revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and KBS accounted for   84.0%   of the Company s management fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   One tenant, Bank of America, N.A., accounted for   13.7%   and   13.3%   of the Company s rental revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Bank of America, N.A. and Healthy Way of Life II, LLC (d.b.a. Life Time Fitness) accounted for   21.2%   and   11.6%   of the Company s rental revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and Bank of America, N.A. accounted for   26.4%   of the Company s rental revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were three states, California, Florida, and Texas, that each accounted for 10.0% or more of the Company s rental revenue. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,   issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which amends the new revenue recognition guidance on identifying performance obligations. The new revenue recognition guidance is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance to determine the impact it may have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar entities. Under this analysis, limited partnerships and other similar entities will be considered a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016, which did not result in changes to the Company s conclusions regarding consolidation of applicable entities. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which serves to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in a company s financial statements. The amendments in the update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that liability. The update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest   Imputation of Interest, which allows an entity to present the debt issuance costs from a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016 and reclassified amounts in each period presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the update relates only to changes in financial statement presentation. See the  Reclassification  section above for further details on the adoption of this guidance.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The update requires companies to account for the software license element of a cloud computing arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses and other licenses of intangible assets. The update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The update will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update serves to simplify the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of awards on the statement of cash flows. The guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period. The Company has not elected early adoption of the amendments in the updates and expects that the new guidance will not have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which amends the existing accounting guidance related to credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments in the update replace t  he incurred loss impairment methodology in the current accounting standards with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.   The update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the update on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which serves to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the update on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pro Forma 
  The following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma basis, the Company s combined results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as though the acquisitions closed during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were completed on January 1, 2015. The supplemental pro forma operating data is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been assuming the transaction had been completed as set forth above, nor do they purport to represent the Company s results of operations for future periods. The table includes pro forma operating results for the assets acquired in the Merger. 

(1) 
    The pro forma results for all periods presented include adjustments to reflect the Company s continuing   5.1%   interest in the Goodman Europe JV, its   100.0%   interest in the   seven   properties it received through distribution from the Duke JV on June 30, 2016, and its   25.0%   interest in Strategic Office Partners.

     Merger with Chambers 
  As described in Note 1, on December 17, 2015, the Company completed a merger transaction in which Legacy Gramercy merged with and into a subsidiary of Chambers. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with Chambers as the legal acquirer and Legacy Gramercy as the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. At Merger closing, each share of Legacy Gramercy common stock, par value   $0.001   per share, that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, was canceled and converted into the right to receive   3.1898   common shares, par value   $0.01   per share, of the Company.   Because the Merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition, consideration for the Merger is computed as if Legacy Gramercy had issued its equity interests to Chambers shareholders.   Consideration for the Merger was   $1,829,241  , based on Legacy Gramercy s closing stock price of   $24.63   on December 17, 2015, the number of Chambers common shares outstanding at the close of the Merger, and the Merger Agreement exchange ratio of   3.1898   set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 1, 2015, or the Merger Agreement.

Acquisition of Gramercy Europe Asset Management 
  On December 19, 2014, the Company acquired ThreadGreen Europe Limited, a United Kingdom based property and asset management platform, which the Company subsequently renamed Gramercy Europe Limited, or Gramercy Europe Asset Management, for   $3,755   and the issuance of   96,535   shares of the Company s common stock, valued at   $652   as of the date of closing. The Company accounted for the acquisition utilizing the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company initially recognized assets of   $902  , liabilities of   $398  , and goodwill of   $3,887  , as well as a   $16   realized foreign currency transaction loss related to the acquisition and during the second quarter of 2015, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation, which resulted in an increase to the allocation to assets by   $190  , an increase to the allocation to liabilities by   $105  , a decrease to goodwill by   $85  , and a decrease to net income by   $80   to record adjustments to amortization and incentive fees. The final allocation of the purchase price included assets of   $1,092  , liabilities of   $503  , and goodwill of   $3,802  . Goodwill represents the fair value of the collaboration expected to be achieved upon consummation of a business combination and is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at acquisition date. For more information on Gramercy Europe Asset Management, refer to Note   5  . 
   
  5  . Unconsolidated Equity Investments 
  The Company has investments in a variety of ventures. The Company will co-invest in entities that own multiple properties with various investors or with one partner. The Company may manage the ventures and collect asset and property management fees as well as incentive fees, otherwise known as profit participation, from its investment partners, or one of the other partners will manage the ventures for asset and property management fees as well as incentive fees. Depending on the structure of the venture, the Company s voting interest may be different than its economic interest. As the Company does not control these ventures, the Company accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting.  
  As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired an interest in   four   unconsolidated entities, the Duke JV, Goodman Europe JV, Goodman UK JV, and the CBRE Strategic Partners Asia, a real estate investment fund. The Company s equity investment in the entities was fair valued on the Merger closing date, and the difference between the historical carrying value of the net assets and the fair value has been recorded as a basis difference. The basis difference is amortized to equity in net income from unconsolidated equity investments over the remaining weighted-average useful life of the underlying assets of each entity.

The Company sold   74.9%   of its interest in the Goodman Europe JV to the Gramercy European Property Fund for gross proceeds of   $148,884   (   134,336  ). The Company s sale of   74.9%   of its interest in the Goodman Europe JV resulted in the Company recording a gain of $  5,341   primarily related to depreciation and amortization recorded since Merger closing date. This gain amount is recorded as a gain on sale of unconsolidated equity investment interests held with a related party on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Following the sale transaction, the Company has a   5.1%   continuing direct interest in the Goodman Europe JV. The transaction was entered into in order to achieve efficiencies from the combination of the two European platforms.

  One   of the properties acquired in December 2015 as part of the Merger was partially leased to Duke Realty, the Company s partner in the Duke JV. Duke Realty acted as the managing member of the Duke JV which was dissolved in July 2016 as described in Note 5, and as such provided asset management, construction, development, leasing and property management services, for which it was entitled to fees as well as a promoted interest. From the date of the Merger through lease expiration in May 2016, Duke Realty leased   30,777   square feet of one of the Company s office properties located in Minnesota which had an aggregate   322,551   rentable square feet. Duke Realty paid the Company   $333   under the lease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 5 for more information on the Company s transactions with the Duke JV. 
  The Company acquired   three   properties in January 2015 in an arms-length transaction from affiliates of KTR Capital Partners, a private industrial real estate investment company, for which one of the Company s trustees, Jeffrey Kelter, served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The properties are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, comprise an aggregate   450,000   square feet and were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $19,750  . 
   
  9  . Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company discloses fair value information, whether or not recognized in the financial statements, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based upon the application of discount rates to estimated future cash flows based upon market yields or by using other valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments and other assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value amounts.

The following table presents the carrying value in the financial statements and approximate fair value of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring and non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Retained CDO Bonds represent the CDOs  subordinate bonds, preferred shares, and ordinary shares, which were retained subsequent to the disposal of Gramercy Finance and were previously eliminated in consolidation.  
              (2) 
    Amounts include   one   and   six   real estate investments as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, classified as held for sale at Merger closing, which are included in discontinued operations.  
              (3) 
    Long-term debt instruments are classified as Level III due to the significance of unobservable inputs which are based upon management assumptions.  
      The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the value: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest, and accounts payable:   These balances in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reasonably approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items. 
  Retained CDO Bonds:   Non-investment grade, subordinate CDO bonds, preferred shares and ordinary shares are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at fair value. The fair value is determined by an internally developed discounted cash flow model. Refer to Note   2   for more information on these instruments. 
  Interest rate swaps:     The Company s interest rate swap agreem  ents are carried at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements based upon third-party valuations. Refer to Note   10   for more information on these derivative instruments.

Mortgage notes payable, unsecured term loans, unsecured revolving credit facilities and senior unsecured notes  : These instruments are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at amortized cost and not at fair value. The fair value of each instrument is estimated by a discounted cash flows model, using discount rates that best reflect current market rates for financings with similar characteristics and credit quality. Mortgage premiums and discounts are amortized to interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations using the effective interest method over the terms of the related notes. Refer to Note   6   for more information on these instruments. 
  Exchangeable Senior Notes:   The Exchangeable Senior Notes are presented at amortized cost on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value is determined based upon a discounted cash-flow methodology using discount rates that best reflect current market rates for instruments with similar with characteristics and credit quality. Refer to Note   6   for more information on these instruments. 
  CBRE Strategic Partners Asia:   The Company s unconsolidated equity investment, CBRE Strategic Partners Asia, is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at fair value. The investment manager of CBRE Strategic Partners Asia applies valuation techniques for the Company s investment carried at fair value based upon the application of the income approach, the direct market comparison approach, the replacement cost approach or third-party appraisals to the underlying assets held in the unconsolidated entity in determining the net asset value attributable to the Company s ownership interest therein. Refer to Note   2   and Note 5 for more information on this investment. 
  Real estate investments designated as held for sale at Merger closing:   The Company designated   six   properties as held for sale at the closing of the Merger on December 17, 2015.   There was   one   property in this classification as of   September 30, 2016   and   six   properties as of December 31, 2015.   These properties are reported at estimated fair value, less costs to sell and are included in discontinued operations. Refer to Note   2   and Note 3 for more information on these investments. 
  Disclosure about fair value measurements is based on pertinent information available to the Company at the reporting date. Although the Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for the purpose of these financial statements since   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
  The following discussion of fair value has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the assets or liabilities. Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and the Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and on a non-recurring basis are categorized in the table below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations. 

Valuation of Level III Instruments 
  Derivative instruments:   Interest rate swaps are valued with the assistance of a third-party derivative specialist, who uses a combination of observable market-based inputs, such as interest rate curves, and unobservable inputs which require significant judgment such as the credit valuation adjustments due to the risk of non-performance by both the Company and its counterparties. The most significant unobservable input in the fair valuation of derivative instruments is the credit valuation adjustment as it requires significant management judgment regarding changes in the credit risk of the Company or its counterparties, however the primary driver of the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the forward interest rate curve. Fair values of the Company s derivative instruments were determined using a Black-Scholes model. Fair value of the Company s embedded exchange option related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes was determined using a probabilistic valuation model with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists.  
  Total unrealized gains (losses) from derivatives for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $7,653   and   $(25,996)  , respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Total unrealized gains (losses) from derivatives for the   three and nine   months ended September 30,   2015   were   $(2,584)   and   $(3,248)  , respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Retained CDO Bonds  : Retained CDO Bonds are valued on a recurring basis using an internally developed discounted cash flow model. Management estimates the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected and applies a discount rate equal to the yield that the Company would expect to pay for similar securities with similar risks at the valuation date. Future expected cash flows generated by management require significant assumptions and judgment regarding the expected resolution of the underlying collateral, which includes loans and other lending investments, real estate investments, and collateralized mortgage backed securities. The resolution of the underlying collateral requires further management assumptions regarding capitalization rates, lease-up periods, future occupancy rates, market rental rates, holding periods, capital improvements, net property operating income, timing of workouts and recoveries, loan loss severities and other factors. The models are most sensitive to the unobservable inputs such as the timing of a loan default or property sale and the severity of loan losses. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation as well as any change in the expected timing of those inputs would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the determination of fair value, the Company has designated its Retained CDO Bonds as Level III.  
  Investment in CBRE Strategic Partners Asia:   The Company s investment in CBRE Strategic Partners Asia is based on the Level III valuation inputs applied by the investment manager of CBRE Strategic Partners Asia, utilizing a mix of different approaches for valuing the underlying real estate related investments within the investment company. The approaches include the income approach, direct market comparison approach and the replacement cost approach for newer properties. For investments owned more than one year, except for investments under construction or incurring significant renovation, CBRE Strategic Partners Asia obtains a third-party appraisal. For investments in real estate under construction or incurring significant renovation, the valuation analysis is prepared by the investment manager of CBRE Strategic Partners Asia. The valuations are most sensitive to the unobservable inputs of discount rates, as well as capitalization rates and expected future cash flows, and significant increases (decreases) in these inputs would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. On a quarterly basis, the Company obtains the financial results of CBRE Strategic Partners Asia and on an annual basis the Company receives its audited financial statements. 
  Real estate investments classified as held for sale at Merger closing:   Real estate investments classified as held for sale at the time of the Merger are reported at estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The fair value of real estate investments and their related lease intangibles is determined by an independent valuation firm using valuation techniques including the market approach, income approach, and cost approach. Key assumptions in the valuations, to which the fair value determinations are most sensitive, include discount and capitalization rates as well as expected future cash flows. Significant increases (decreases) in these inputs would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. As the inputs are unobservable, the Company determined the inputs used to value this liability fall within Level III for fair value reporting.

  Quantitative information regarding the valuation techniques and the range of significant unobservable Level III inputs used to determine fair value measurements on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   are:

The following roll forward table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level III inputs: 

(1) 
    The Company terminated one interest rate swap in connection with repayment of the related mortgage loan, and as a result of this termination, the Company recorded loss of   $8   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The Company measured its real estate investments classified as held for sale at the time of the Merger on a non-recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. The Company had   one   and   six   assets in this classification as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, as the Company sold   five   of the assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These assets were recorded at fair value, less costs to sell of   $10,558   and   $393,984   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in discontinued operations. Refer to Note   3   for further information on these assets. 
   
  10  . Derivatives and Non-Derivative Hedging Instruments  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps, which are cash flow hedges. Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item expires or is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative s change in fair value and the change in value of a non-hedging derivative instrument are immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative accounting may increase or decrease reported net income and shareholders  equity, depending on future levels of LIBOR interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows, provided the contract is carried through to full term.

Borrowings on the Company s multicurrency tranche of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, which are designated as non-derivative net investment hedges, are recognized at par value based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of the draw. Subsequent changes in the exchange rate of the Company s non-derivative net investment hedge are recognized as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (loss).  Refer to Note 2 and Note 9 for additional information on the Company s derivatives and non-derivative hedging instruments, including the fair value measurement of these instruments, as applicable. 
  The following table summarizes the notional and fair value of the Company s derivatives and hedging instruments at   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate fair value of the Company s derivatives is presented on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in d  erivative instruments and the aggregate carrying value of the non-derivative net investment hedges is included in the balance of the Company s 2015 Revolving Credit Facility.   The notional value is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in this instrument at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 
  The Company s derivatives and hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Through its interest rate swaps, the Company is hedging exposure to variability in future interest payments on its debt facilities. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate swap derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as a net liability of   $28,613  . Swap (gain) loss of   $(83)   and   $(817)   was recognized as interest expense for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations with respect to interest rate swap hedge ineffectiveness, or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness, which relates to the off-market financing element associated with certain derivatives. As discussed in Note 6, during the first half of 2016, the Company amended its   5  -Year Term Loan and its   7  -Year Term Loan in order to remove the   0.00%   rate floor on the applicable LIBOR that existed in the original loan agreements, and as a result, during the second quarter of 2016 the Company reversed previously recorded hedge ineffectiveness of   $2,564  . No gain or loss was recognized with respect to hedge ineffectiveness or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $274   and   $905  , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense related to a derivative terminated in 2015. Over time, the realized and unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. During the next 12 months, the Company expects that   $9,113   will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase in interest expense for the Company s interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, the Company will recognize   $2,923   in interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining original term of terminated swaps through June 2019, representing amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance related to the swap, and of this amount,   $1,087   will be recognized in interest expense during the next 12 months.

The Company hedges its investments based in foreign currencies using non-derivative net investment hedges in conjunction with borrowings under the multicurrency tranche of its 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company s non-derivative net investment hedge on its euro-denominated investments, which was entered into in September 2015, is used to hedge exposure to changes in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate underlying its unconsolidated net equity investments in the Gramercy European Property Fund and the Goodman Europe JV, both of which have euros as their functional currency. The Company s non-derivative net investment hedge on its British pound sterling-denominated investments, which was entered into in July 2016, is used to hedge exposure to changes in the British pound sterling-U.S. dollar exchange rate underlying its unconsolidated net equity investment in the Goodman UK JV and its wholly-owned property in Coventry, UK, both of which have British pounds sterling as their functional currency. At September 30, 2016, the non-derivative net investment hedge value is reported at carrying value as a net liability of   $93,365  , which is included in the balance of the senior unsecured revolving credit facility on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded net gain (loss) of   $(109)   and   $(175)  , respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) from the impact of exchange rates related to the non-derivative net investment hedges.   No   gain or loss was recognized with respect to non-derivative net investment hedge ineffectiveness, or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness, in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . When the non-derivative net investments being hedged are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the translation adjustment accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings. 
  In June 2016, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract to mitigate its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements in the euro, specifically in relation to funds received in euros on the sale of   74.9%   of its   80.0%   interest in the Goodman Europe JV. The foreign currency forward was a derivative contract, which was not designated as a hedging instrument, through which the Company was committed to deliver a certain amount of currency at a set price on a specific date in the future. The forward contract locked in the Company s future currency exchange rate for the term of the contract, thus minimizing the Company s exposure to rate fluctuations during this period. The Company settled the contract on July 7, 2016. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized net income (loss) of   $128   and   $(22)  , respectively, in other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, related to the change in the value of the euro-denominated asset underlying the contract.  
   
  11  . Shareholders  Equity (Deficit) 
  The equity structure in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements following the reverse merger reflects the equity structure of the Company, and as such, the Company s common shares outstanding have been adjusted retroactively for all prior periods presented computed on the basis of the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio of   3.1898   established in the Merger Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s authorized capital shares consist of   1,000,000,000   shares of beneficial interest,   $0.01   par value per share, of which the Company is authorized to issue up to   990,000,000   common shares of beneficial interest, par value   $0.01   per share, or common shares, and   10,000,000   preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value of   $0.01  , or preferred shares. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   421,978,800   common shares and   3,500,000   preferred shares were issued and outstanding, respectively. All share, share price, and per share data has been updated retroactively to reflect the Merger exchange ratio of   3.1898  . 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company s common dividends are as follows:    

In July 2016, the Company s board of trustees approved the establishment of an  at the market  equity issuance program, or ATM. The Company expects to file a prospectus supplement to its currently effective registration statement with the SEC during November 2016, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell common shares with an aggregate gross sales price of up to   $375,000  .

In June 2016, the Company adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, under which shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase additional common shares of the Company. In August 2016, the Company registered   10,000,000   common shares related to the DRIP. There have been no shares issued under the DRIP as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In February 2016, the Company s board of trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to   $100,000   of the Company s outstanding common shares. Purchases under the program will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company in its discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not repurchase any shares. 
  In February 2015, Legacy Gramercy s board of directors approved a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of its common stock and outstanding OP Units. The reverse stock split was effective after the close of trading on March 20, 2015, and the Company s common stock began trading on a reverse split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange on March 23, 2015.  
  Preferred Shares 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   3,500,000   of its Series A Preferred Shares outstanding with a mandatory liquidation preference of   $25.00   per share. Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares are entitled to receive annual dividends of   $1.78125   per share on a quarterly basis, which are cumulative, subject to certain provisions. On or after August 15, 2019, the Company can, at its option, redeem the Series A Preferred Shares at par for cash.  
  Equity Plan Activities 
  In June 2016, the Company instituted its 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Company s board of trustees and shareholders. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the following awards to be made: (i) stock options that qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) stock options that do not qualify, (iii) stock appreciation rights, (iv) share awards, (v) restricted share units, and (vi) dividend equivalents and other equity awards, including LTIP Units. The aggregate number of common shares of the Company that may be issued or transferred under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan is   12,000,000   shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Company s common shares that are issued or transferred under the 2016 Equity Plan may be authorized but unissued common shares of the Company or reacquired common shares of the Company, including common shares of the Company purchased by it on the open market for purposes of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan became effective on June 23, 2016 and will terminate on the day immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of its effective date, unless sooner terminated by the board of trustees. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   10,828,176   shares available for grant under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.  
  Following the Merger until the adoption of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan in June 2016, the Company s active equity incentive plan, from which share awards were issued, was the Chambers equity incentive plan, or the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company s, 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2012 Inducement Plan, 2012 Outperformance Plan, 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2015 Equity Incentive Plan continued to exist following the Merger, however they are inactive and thus no new share awards will be issued out of any of these plans.  
  In September 2016, the Company issued a maximum total of   1,140,304   LTIP Units to three executives under its 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The number of LTIPs units actually earned by the grantees will be based on the achievement of established performance hurdles with respect to the Company s actual and relative total shareholder returns during the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019. Of the earned units,   50.0%   will vest on June 30, 2019, and the remaining   50.0%   will vest on June 30, 2020, based on continued employment through that date. Vested LTIP Units are convertible on a   1  -for-1 basis to OP Units. 
  Effective at the closing of the Merger, the change in accelerated vesting control provisions of the 2012 Outperformance Plan were waived by all plan participants, and as a result the LTIP Units continued, subject to the original service and performance conditions.

  Deferred Stock Compensation Plan for Directors 
  The Legacy Gramercy Directors  Deferral Program terminated upon consummation of the Merger. In connection with the closing of the Merger, on December 17, 2015 each outstanding phantom share granted under Legacy Gramercy s Directors  Deferral Program, was vested and, on the first business day of the month following the Merger closing, converted into the right to receive a number of the Company s common shares, rounded to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number of subject phantom shares by the exchange ratio of the Merger. As a result, the directors received an aggregate of   $916   in cash and   410,713   in shares in January 2016. The portion paid out in cash was classified as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015.  
  Earnings per Share 
  The Company has adopted the two-class computation method, and thus includes all participating securities in the computation of basic shares for the periods in which the Company has net income available to vested common shares outstanding. A participating security is defined as an unvested share-based payment award containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends regardless of whether or not the awards ultimately vest or expire. Net losses are not allocated to participating securities unless the holder has a contractual obligation to share in the losses.

Earnings per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are computed as follows: 

(1) 
    As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Legacy Gramercy was converted into   3.1898   of a newly issued common share of the Company. Therefore, the historical data related to quarterly earnings per common share for the periods ended before December 31, 2015 have been adjusted by the Merger exchange ratio of   3.1898  . 
     Diluted income (loss) per share assumes the conversion of all common share equivalents into an equivalent number of common shares if the effect is not anti-dilutive. Options were computed using the treasury share method. The Company only includes the effect of the excess conversion premium on its Exchangeable Senior Notes in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as the Company has the intent and ability to settle the debt component of the Exchangeable Senior Notes in cash and the excess conversion premium in shares.

The average price of the Company s common shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was above the exchange price of   $7.54   for the periods, therefore there is potential dilutive effect for these periods. The Company had   net loss available to common shares outstanding during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , thus the excess conversion premium was excluded from the calculation of earnings per share for the period, however during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   Company had net income avai  lable to common shares outstanding  , therefore, the potential dilutive effect of the excess conversion premium was included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the period  . The average price of the Company s common shares was below the exchange price of   $7.76   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and above the exchange price of   $7.76   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . Therefore, there is no potential dilutive effect for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , however there is potential dilutive effect of the excess conversion premium for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , however due to the net loss available to common shares outstanding during the period, the excess conversion premium was excluded from the calculation of earnings per share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company excluded from its number of diluted shares used for EPS   58,270   share options,   3,519,584   unvested share based payment awards,   1,017,326   OP Units, and   3,336,987   shares related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes, because, due to the net loss from continuing operations excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest and adjusted for preferred dividends declared during the period, these shares were anti-dilutive during the period. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company excluded from its number of diluted shares used for EPS   44,624   share options,   2,969,744   unvested share based payment awards,   514,834   phantom share units,   1,582,067   OP Units, and   658,380   shares related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes, because, due to the net loss from continuing operations excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest and adjusted for preferred dividends declared during the period, these shares were anti-dilutive during the period. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company excluded unvested restricted share awards of   1,118,760   and   630,566  , respectively, from its weighted average basic shares outstanding due to the net loss from continuing operations excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest and adjusted for preferred dividends declared during the periods. 
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 is comprised of the following:

12  . Noncontrolling Interest 
  Noncontrolling interests represent the common units of limited partnership interest in the Company s Operating Partnership, or OP Units, not held by the Company as well as third-party equity interests in the Company s other consolidated subsidiaries. OP Units are redeemable at the election of the holder for cash equal to the then fair market value of   one   of the Company s common shares, par value   $0.01   per share, except that the Company may, at its election, acquire each OP Unit for   one   of its common shares.  The OP Unit holders do not have any obligation to provide additional contributions to the partnership, nor do they have any decision making powers or control over the business of the Operating Partnership. The OP Unit holders do not have voting rights; however, they are entitled to receive dividends. The OP Unit redemption rights are outside of the Company s control, and thus the OP Units are classified as a component of temporary equity and are shown in the mezzanine equity section of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is party by assumption to a registration rights agreement with the holders of the OP Units that requires the Company, subject to the terms and conditions and certain exceptions set forth therein, to file and maintain a registration statement relating to the issuance of shares of its common shares upon redemption of OP Units.  
  In April 2016, each of the outstanding common units of limited partnership interest not held by the Company or its subsidiaries, which represented interests in Legacy Gramercy s operating partnership and were redeemable for   3.1898   of the Company s common shares following the Merger, were exchanged for   3.1898   OP Units, which are each redeemable for one of the Company s common shares as described above. All references to OP Units in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements refer to common units of limited partnership interest in Legacy Gramercy s operating partnership prior to the exchange and to common units of limited partnership interest in GPT Operating Partnership LP following the exchange, and reflect the updated exchange ratio of one OP Unit redeemable for one of the Company s common shares. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the noncontrolling interest unit holders owned   941,537   OP Units, which can be redeemed for   941,537   o  f the Company s common shares. The outstanding OP Units as of   September 30, 2016     represent an interest of approximately   0.22%   in the Company. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   469,372   and   453,129   OP Units, respectively, were converted into common shares of the Company. At   September 30, 2016  ,   941,537   common   shares of the Company were reserved for issuance upon redemption of OP Units. 
  OP Units are recorded at the greater of cost basis or fair market value based on the closing share price of the Company s common shares at the end of the reporting period. As of   September 30, 2016  , the value of the OP units was   $9,076  . The Company attributes a portion of its net income (loss) during each reporting period to noncontrolling interest based on the percentage ownership of OP Unit holders relative to the Company s total outstanding common shares and OP Units. The Company recognizes changes in fair value in the OP Units through accumulated deficit, however decreases in fair value are recognized only to the extent that increases to the amount in temporary equity were previously recorded. The Company s diluted earnings per share includes the effect of any potential shares outstanding from redemption of the OP Units. 
  Below is the rollforward of the activity relating to the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  :

The Company s interest in European Fund Manager is presented in the equity section of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
   
  13  . Commitments and Contingencies 
  Funding Commitments 
  The Company is obligated to fund the development of   two   build-to-suit properties, including a   240,411   square foot industrial property in Round Rock, Texas, which is a consolidated VIE that the Company will acquire upon substantial completion through a forward purchase contract and a   240,800   square foot industrial property in Summerville, South Carolina. The Company s remaining future commitment for these properties at   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $47,460  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has funded   $55,892   (   50,000  ) to the Gramercy European Property Fund, representing its total funding commitment to the Gramercy European Property Fund. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had funded   $25,663   (   23,160  ) to the Gramercy European Property Fund. Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the closing date for completed transactions and (ii) the exchange rate that prevailed on   September 30, 2016  , in the case of unfunded commitments.  
  The Company has committed to fund   $100,000   to Strategic Office Partners, of which   $16,027   has been funded as of September 30, 2016.   See Note   5  ,  Unconsolidated Equity Investments,  for further information on the Gramercy European Property Fund and Strategic Office Partners. 
  Legal Proceedings  
  The Company evaluates litigation contingencies based on information currently available, including the advice of counsel and the assessment of available insurance coverage. The Company will establish accruals for litigation and claims when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. The Company will periodically review these contingencies which may be adjusted if circumstances change. The outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential losses at particular points may be difficult to ascertain. If a range of loss is estimated and an amount within such range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued.

Legacy Gramercy, its board of directors, Chambers and/or Merger Sub are named as defendants in   two   pending putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Legacy Gramercy stockholders challenging the Merger.   Two   suits that were separately filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County, captioned (i) Berliner v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Index No. 652424/2015 (filed July 9, 2015) and (ii) Gensler v. Baum, et al., Index No. 157432/2015 (filed July 22, 2015), have been consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Gramercy Property Trust Stockholder Litigation, Index No. 652424/2015 (the  New York Action ). In addition,   four   suits that were separately filed in Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, captioned (i) Jobin v. DuGan, et al., Case No. 24C15003942 (filed July 27, 2015)  (ii) Vojik v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Case No. 24C15004412 (filed August 25, 2015)  (iii) Hoffbauer et al. v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., 24C15004904 (filed September 24, 2015) (originally filed as   two   separate suits in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, captioned Plemons v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., Case No. 03C15007943 (filed July 24, 2015) and Hoffbauer et al. v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., Case No. 03C15008639 (filed August 12, 2015), and refiled as a single action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on September 24, 2015)  and (iv) Morris v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Case No. 24C15004972 (filed September 28, 2015) have been consolidated into a single action under the caption Glenn W. Morris v. Gramercy Property Trust Inc. et al., Case No. 24C15004972 (the  Maryland Action,  and together with the New York Action, the  Actions ). The complaints allege, among other things, that the directors of Legacy Gramercy breached their fiduciary duties to Legacy Gramercy stockholders by agreeing to sell the Company for inadequate consideration and agreeing to improper deal protection terms in the merger agreement, and that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on Form S4 on September 11, 2015 was materially incomplete and misleading. The complaints also allege that Chambers, Merger Sub and/or Legacy Gramercy aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duty. The amended complaint in the Morris consolidated action also asserts derivative claims on behalf of Legacy Gramercy for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors of Legacy Gramercy. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, an injunction barring the Merger, rescission of the Merger to the extent it is already implemented, declaratory relief, an award of damages and/or costs/attorney fees. 
  On December 7, 2015, the parties to the Actions entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the  MOU ), which provides for the settlement of the Actions. While the defendants in the Actions continue to vigorously deny all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage to any of the plaintiffs or the class of stockholders of Legacy Gramercy, and believe that no supplemental disclosure is required under the applicable law, in order to (i) avoid the burden, inconvenience, expense and distraction of further litigation in connection with the Actions, (ii) finally put to rest and terminate all of the claims that were or could have been asserted against the defendants in the Actions and (iii) permit the Merger to proceed without risk of the courts in New York or Maryland ordering an injunction or damages in connection with the Actions, Chambers and Legacy Gramercy agreed, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, pursuant to the terms of the MOU, to make certain supplemental disclosures related to the Merger, which were set forth in Legacy Gramercy s Current Report on Form 8K filed with on December 7, 2015. 
  Pursuant to the MOU, the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement. The stipulation of settlement is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, court approval following notice to Legacy Gramercy stockholders. On November 2, 2016, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and scheduling a hearing to consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement. If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it will resolve and release all claims by stockholders of Legacy Gramercy challenging the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any disclosure made in connection therewith, pursuant to terms that will be set forth in the notice sent to Legacy Gramercy stockholders prior to final approval of the settlement. In addition, in connection with the settlement, the parties contemplate that plaintiffs  counsel will file a petition for an award of attorneys  fees and expenses to be paid by Gramercy or its successor. There can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement. In the event that the settlement is not approved or that the conditions are not satisfied, the settlement may be terminated. 
  On October 1, 2015, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County by a purported shareholder of Chambers. The action, captioned Elstein v. Chambers Street Properties et al., Docket No. L00225415 (the  New Jersey Action ), names as defendants Chambers, its board of trustees and Legacy Gramercy. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the trustees of Chambers breached their fiduciary duties to Chambers  shareholders by agreeing to the Merger after a flawed sales process and by approving improper deal protection terms in the merger agreement, and that Legacy Gramercy aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint also alleges that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus was materially misleading and incomplete. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, an injunction barring the Merger, rescission of the Merger to the extent it is already implemented, declaratory relief and an award of damages.

On December 3, 2015, the parties to the New Jersey Action entered into a Stipulation of Settlement providing for the settlement of the New Jersey Action. While the defendants in the New Jersey Action continue to vigorously deny all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage to any of the plaintiffs or the class of shareholders of Chambers, and believe that no supplemental disclosure is required under the applicable law, in order to (i) avoid the burden, inconvenience, expense and distraction of further litigation in connection with the New Jersey Action, (ii) finally put to rest and terminate all of the claims that were or could have been asserted against the defendants in the New Jersey Action and (iii) permit the Merger to proceed without risk of the Superior Court of New Jersey ordering an injunction or damages in connection with the New Jersey Action, Chambers and Legacy Gramercy agreed, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, to make certain supplemental disclosures related to the Merger, all of which were set forth in Legacy Gramercy s Current Report on Form 8K filed with on December 7, 2015. The Stipulation of Settlement is subject to customary conditions, including court approval following notice to the Chambers shareholders. On April 4, 2016, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On July 1, 2016 the court issued a final order approving the settlement. 
  The defendants believe the lawsuits are without merit. 
  In December 2010, the Company sold its   45.0%   joint venture interest in the leased fee of the 2 Herald Square property in New York, New York, for approximately   $25,600   plus assumed mortgage debt of approximately   $86,100  , or the 2 Herald Sale Transaction. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, the New York City Department of Finance, or the NYC DOF, and New York State Department of Taxation, or the NYS DOT, issued notices of determination assessing, in the case of the NYC DOF notice, approximately   $2,924   of real property transfer tax, plus interest, and, in the case of the NYS DOT notice, approximately   $446   of real property transfer tax, plus interest, collectively, the Transfer Tax Assessments, against the Company in connection with the 2 Herald Sale Transaction. 
  In September 2013, the Company filed a petition challenging the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment with the New York City Tax Appeal Tribunal. In July 2014, the Company filed a similar petition challenging the NYS DOT Transfer Tax Assessment. Trial of the Company s NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment appeal was completed in December 2014. 
  In April 2015, a New York City Administrative Law Judge denied the Company s petition challenging the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment and ruled that the Company is liable for the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment. In July 2015, the Company appealed the adverse Administrative Law Judge decision to the New York City Tax Appeals Tribunal, or the NYC Tribunal.  In July 2016, the NYC Tribunal denied the Company s appeal. In November 2016, the Company appealed the adverse decision of the NYC Tribunal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. A decision by the Appellate Division is expected in the second quarter of 2017. 
  In June 2016, a New York State Administrative Law Judge ruled in the Company s favor in connection with the NYS DOT Transfer Tax Assessment. In July 2016, NYS DOT appealed the adverse Administrative Law Judge decision to the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal, or the NYS Tribunal. A hearing before the NYS Tribunal is expected in the first quarter of 2017. 
  In April 2015, to stop the accrual of additional interest while the Company s appeals are pending, the Company paid the NYC DOF   $4,025   in full satisfaction of the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment and the NYS DOT   $617   in full satisfaction of the NYS DOF Transfer Tax Assessment. There was   no   additional interest recorded for the matter for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . There was   $0   and   $68   of additional interest recorded in discontinued operations for the matter for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  In connection with the Company s property acquisitions and the Merger, the Company has determined that there is a risk it will have to pay future amounts to tenants related to continuing operating expense reimbursement audits. The Company has estimated a range of loss and determined that its best estimate of total loss is   $8,000  , including   $1,000   related to the Merger, which has been accrued and recorded in other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company has determined that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred in excess of   $8,000   and estimates this range to be   $8,000   to   $13,000  . 
  In addition, the Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various litigation matters that are considered routine litigation incidental to its business, none of which are considered material.

Office Leases 
  The Company has several office locations, which are each subject to operating lease agreements. These office locations include the Company s corporate office at 521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, and the Company s seven regional offices located across the United States and Europe. Additionally, in April 2016, the Company entered into a lease for a new corporate office location at 90 Park Avenue, New York, New York. The Company will relocate to the new office upon completion of improvements to the space in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  Capital and Operating Ground Leases 
  Certain properties acquired are subject to ground leases, which are accounted for as operating and capital leases. The ground leases have varying ending dates, renewal options and rental rate escalations, with the latest leases extending to   June 2053  . Future minimum rental payments to be made by the Company under these noncancelable ground leases, excluding increases resulting from increases in the consumer price index, are as follows: 

14. Income Taxes  
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT, and as such, generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders in accordance with REIT requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will then be subject to U.S. federal income taxes until it is able to qualify for REIT status again, however, the Company believes that it is organized and will operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and the Company intends to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner so that it will qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company may, however, be subject to certain state and local taxes. Additionally, the Company s TRSs are subject to federal, state and local taxes. The Company s asset and property management business, Gramercy Asset Management, partially conducts its business through a wholly-owned TRS. In addition to the limitation on the Company s use of its net operating losses under Section 382, since the Company uses separate subsidiary REITs and taxable REIT subsidiaries to conduct different aspects of its business, losses incurred by the individual subsidiary REITs and TRSs are only available to offset taxable income derived by each respective subsidiary REIT or TRS. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company recorded   $331   and   $3,734   of income tax expense, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded   $985   and   $2,116   of income tax expense, respectively. Tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in continuing operations is comprised of state and local taxes and federal taxes primarily attributable to Gramercy Asset Management.  
  To the extent the Company incurs any interest or penalties on its material uncertain tax positions, these amounts will be recognized in the financial statements as interest expense and operating expense, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company did not incur any material interest or penalties.

15. Segment Reporting 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has determined that it has   two   reportable operating segments: Asset Management and Investments/Corporate. The reportable segments are determined based upon the management approach, which looks to the Company s internal organizational structure. The Company s lines of business require different support infrastructures. All significant inter-segment balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  The Asset Management segment includes substantially all of the Company s activities related to asset and property management of commercial properties located throughout the United States and Europe. The Asset Management segment generates revenues from fee income related to the management agreements for properties owned by third parties throughout the United States and Europe.  
  The Investments/Corporate segment includes all of the Company s activities related to the investment and ownership of commercial properties located throughout the United States and Europe. The Investments/Corporate segment generates revenues from rental revenues from properties owned by the Company, either directly or   in unconsolidated equity investments.  
  The Company evaluates performance based on the following financial measures for each segment:

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except share, per share and property data) 
   
  Overview 
  Gramercy Property Trust, or the Company or Gramercy, a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a leading global investor and asset manager of commercial real estate. We specialize in acquiring and managing single-tenant, net leased industrial, office, and specialty properties. We focus on income producing properties leased to high quality tenants in major markets in the United States and Europe.  
  We earn revenues primarily through rental revenues on properties that we own in the United States and asset management revenues on properties owned by third parties in the United States and Europe. We also own unconsolidated equity investments in the United States, Europe, and Asia. 
  On December 17, 2015, Chambers Street Properties, or Chambers, a Maryland REIT, completed a merger, or the Merger, with Gramercy Property Trust Inc., or Legacy Gramercy, a Maryland corporation, pursuant to which Legacy Gramercy shareholders received 3.1898 common shares of beneficial interest of Chambers for each share of common stock of Legacy Gramercy held. Following the Merger, Chambers changed its name to Gramercy Property Trust and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, using the  GPT  stock symbol.  Legacy Gramercy s executive management team manages the combined company. 
  In the Merger, Chambers was the legal acquirer and Legacy Gramercy was the  accounting acquirer  for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the financial information set forth herein subsequent to the close of the Merger on December 17, 2015 reflects results of the combined company, and financial information prior to the close of the Merger reflects Legacy Gramercy results. For this reason, period to period comparisons may not be meaningful. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our wholly-owned portfolio consists of   295   properties containing an aggregate of approximately   53,306,568   rentable square feet with   98.5%   occupancy. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have ownership interests in   46   properties with   97.6%   occupancy, which are held in our unconsolidated equity investments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our asset management business, which operates under the name Gramercy Asset Management, manages for third parties approximately   $1,200,000   of commercial real estate assets, including approximately   $871,000   of assets in Europe.  
  In August 2016, we partnered with TPG Real Estate, or TPG, to form Strategic Office Partners, an equity investment that will invest in single-tenant office properties in the United States. We   contributed six properties to Strategic Office Partners valued at $187,500 and, in exchange, we received cash proceeds of   $140,625  , equivalent to TPG s   75.0%   interest in the venture, plus a   25.0%   interest in Strategic Office Partners valued at   $46,608  . Concurrently with the initial funding of Strategic Office Partners, we received a distribution of   $30,581   representing our pro rata share of loan proceeds, resulting in an initial equity investment of   $16,027  .  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   16   properties aggregating   2,795,476   square feet for a total purchase price of approximately   $237,432  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   48   properties aggregating   11,464,734   square feet for a total purchase price of approximately   $862,341  . Additionally, on June 30, 2016, we received 100.0% ownership of   seven   properties previously held in our joint venture with Duke Realty through a distribution of real estate assets by the joint venture, which had an aggregate   4,189,630   square feet and total fair value of   $276,100  .   
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   10   properties aggregating   2,435,130   square feet for total gross proceeds of approximately   $394,241  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   20   properties aggregating   5,070,129   square feet for total gross proceeds of approximately   $1,041,941  . Of the properties sold during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , six properties comprising an aggregate   980,825   square feet with a total value of $187,500 were contributed to Strategic Office Partners. Additionally, on June 30, 2016, we sold 74.9% of our 80.0% interest in our European joint venture with the Goodman Group to our unconsolidated equity investment in Europe, Gramercy Property Europe plc, or the Gramercy European Property Fund, for gross proceeds of   $148,884   (   134,336  ).  
  
   63 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent we distribute our taxable income, if any, to our shareholders. We have in the past established, and may in the future establish TRSs to effect various taxable transactions. Those TRSs would incur U.S. federal, state and local taxes on the taxable income from their activities.  
  We were formed as a Maryland REIT in March 2004 and commenced operations in July 2004 following an initial private placement of our common shares. In May 2013, we listed our common shares on the NYSE under the symbol  CSG.  Following the Merger in December 2015, we changed our NYSE trading symbol to  GPT.  We conduct all of our operations through GPT Operating Partnership LP, our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership conducts our commercial real estate investment business through various wholly-owned entities and our realty management business through a wholly-owned TRS. 
  Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to  Company,   Gramercy,   we,   our,  and  us  mean Legacy Gramercy and one or more of our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the Merger closing and Gramercy Property Trust and one or more of our subsidiaries for periods following the Merger closing. 
  Asset and Property Management  
  In addition to net leased investing, we also operate a commercial real estate management business for third parties. As of   September 30, 2016  , this business, which operates under the name Gramercy Asset Management, manages approximately   $1,200,000   of commercial properties. We manage properties for companies including KBS and the Gramercy European Property Fund.  
  We have an integrated asset management platform within Gramercy Asset Management to consolidate responsibility for, and control over, leasing, lease administration, property management, operations, construction management, tenant relationship management and property accounting. To the extent that we provide asset management services for third-party property owners, we provide such services in consultation with and at the direction of such owners.  
  In the third quarter of 2016, concurrent with the formation of Strategic Office Partners, we entered into property management and leasing agreements with Strategic Office Partners, which provide for fees related to property management, project management and leasing services. Additionally, we will receive an asset management fee of 0.35% of aggregate purchase price as well as a 5.0% promoted interest after achieving an internal rate of return of 13.5% from our investment in Strategic Office Partners.

Results of Operations 
   
  Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Revenues 

The increase of   $53,612   in rental revenue is due to our wholly-owned property portfolio of   295   properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   168   properties as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  The increase of   $2,019   in third-party management fees is primarily attributable to the increase of $3,016 in incentive fees earned from KBS as well as increased revenue from our European management platform during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which is partially offset by a decrease in disposition, property management, and accounting fees earned from our contract with KBS primarily due to property sales from the portfolio subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . 
  The increase of   $9,994   in operating expense reimbursements is due to our wholly-owned property portfolio of   295   properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   168   properties as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  
   65 

Expenses 

Property operating expenses are comprised of expenses directly attributable to our real estate portfolio. Property operating expenses include property related costs which we are responsible for during the lease term but can be passed through to the tenant as operating expense reimbursement revenue. The increase of   $11,634   is due to our wholly-owned property portfolio of   295   properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   168   properties as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Property management expenses are comprised of costs related to our asset and property management business. The increase of   $30   in property management expenses is primarily related to the increase in the expense related to our European management platform, offset by the reduction of expenses related to KBS. 
  The increase of   $37,743   in depreciation and amortization expense is due to our wholly-owned property portfolio of   295   properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   168   properties as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  The increase of   $3,417   in general and administrative expense is primarily related to increased legal and professional fees and as well as increased compensation costs related to the growth of the Company. 
  The decrease of   $5,275   in acquisition and merger-related expenses is attributable to the acquisition of   16   properties in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the acquisition of   16   properties and $5,195 in merger-related costs in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The increase of   $9,182   in interest expense is primarily due to increased borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and term loans, our Unsecured Senior Notes and the mortgages we assumed on our real estate acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2014. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of   $13,777   related to early termination fees and the write-off of unamortized on mortgage loan payoffs as costs incurred related to a mortgage defeasance during the period. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized an impairment on real estate investments of   $1,053   related to the properties sold during the period.  
  The provision for taxes was   $331   and   $985   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in federal taxes related to adjustments recorded for finalized tax returns in the periods.  
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we realized net gains on disposal of   $(2,336)   and   $(392)   related to the disposal of 10 and two properties, respectively, during the periods.

  The increase of   $12,957   in third-party management fees is primarily attributable to an increase of $15,451 in incentive fees earned from KBS as well as increased revenue from our European management platform during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increase is partially offset by a decrease in disposition, property management, asset management, and accounting fees earned from our contracts with KBS and other third parties primarily due to property sales from the managed portfolios subsequent to   September 30, 2015   and the cessation of one of our third-party management contracts following the sale of nearly all of its properties as of December 31, 2015. 
  The increase of   $36,605   in operating expense reimbursements is due to our wholly-owned property portfolio of   295   properties as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   168   properties as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , other income is primarily comprised of and realized foreign currency exchange gain (loss), insurance refunds, and miscellaneous property related income. 
   The equity in net loss of unconsolidated equity investments of   $(4,061)   and   $(974)   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, represents our proportionate share of the loss generated by our unconsolidated equity investments.

  The financial information presented is not an alternative to GAAP. The same-store and acquisition results of operations may be calculated differently by other REITs and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes. 
  The tables and discussion below present the results related to our same-store and acquisition operations.  

69 

Results of the same-store and acquisition properties in our portfolio, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

The increase in net income of the same store properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the defeasance of a mortgage loan on 11 properties during the period. Additionally there was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to purchase price allocation adjustments, which was largely offset by an increase in rental revenue. 
  
   70 

Results of the same-store and acquisition properties in our portfolio, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

The slight decrease in net income of the same-store properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to purchase price allocation adjustments and the hyper-amortization of in-place lease intangible assets associated with the same leases an increase in rental revenue related to the hyper-amortization of below market lease liabilities for leases which were terminated prior to expiration, which is partially offset by an increase in rental revenue. 
  
   71 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to fund acquisitions of real estate assets, repay borrowings, pay dividends and other general business needs. In addition to cash on hand, our primary sources of funds for short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including working capital, distributions, debt service and additional investments, consist of: (i) cash flow from operations; (ii) borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and term loans; and, (iii) proceeds from our common equity and debt offerings. We believe these sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements.  
  Our cash flow from operations primarily consists of rental revenue, expense reimbursements from tenants, and third-party management fees. Our cash flow from operations is our principal source of funds that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, general and administrative expenses, operating capital expenditures, dividends, and acquisition and merger-related expenses. Our ability to fund our short-term liquidity needs, including debt service and general operations (including employment related benefit expenses), through cash flow from operations can be evaluated through the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Our ability to borrow under our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and term loan facilities is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants including our maximum secured and unsecured leverage ratios, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, consolidated adjusted net worth values, unencumbered asset values, occupancy rates, and portfolio lease terms. 
  We have several unconsolidated equity investments with partners who we consider to be financially stable. Our unconsolidated equity investments are financed with non-recourse debt or equity. We believe that cash flows from the underlying real estate investments and capital commitments will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our unconsolidated equity investments.  
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90.0% of our taxable income. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. As of the date of this filing, we expect that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated short-term and long-term liquidity needs as well as our recourse liabilities, if any.  
   
  Cash Flows 
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased   $103,738   to   $169,739   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $66,001   for the same period in   2015  . Operating cash flow was generated primarily by net rental revenue from our real estate investments, management fees, and distributions from unconsolidated equity investments.  
  Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $352,417   compared to net cash used by investing activities of   $830,876   during the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities in 2016 is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the disposition of   20   properties during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net of any assumed mortgages. 
  Net cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $593,698   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $602,913   during the same period in   2015  . The decrease in cash flow is primarily attributable to payoffs of certain mortgage loans, paydowns made on the unsecured revolving credit facility, and increased payment of dividends in 2016, which is offset by proceeds from the sale of common shares in 2015.

Equity Structure 
  Our equity structure following the reverse merger transaction reflects the equity structure of Chambers, the surviving corporation. As such, our common shares outstanding have been adjusted retroactively for all prior periods presented computed on the basis of the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio of   3.1898   established in the Merger Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our authorized capital shares consists of   1,000,000,000   shares of beneficial interest,   $0.01   par value per share, of which we are authorized to issue up to   990,000,000   common shares of beneficial interest, par value   $0.01   per share of our common shares and   10,000,000   preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value of   $0.01  , or preferred shares. There were   236,710,763   common shares issued at the closing of the Merger, representing the number of Legacy Gramercy s outstanding shares multiplied by the exchange ratio of   3.1898  , and there were   3,500,000   shares of 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares issued, which were exchanged from Legacy Gramercy s outstanding 7.125% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at Merger closing. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   421,978,800   common shares and   3,500,000   preferred shares were issued and outstanding, respectively. 
  In June 2016, we instituted our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by our board of trustees and shareholders. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the following awards to be made: (i) stock options that qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) stock options that do not qualify, (iii) stock appreciation rights, (iv) share awards, (v) restricted share units, and (vi) dividend equivalents and other equity awards, including LTIP Units. The aggregate number of our common shares that may be issued or transferred under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan is 12,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan became effective on June 23, 2016 and will terminate on the day immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of its effective date, unless sooner terminated by the board of trustees.  
  In September 2016, we issued a maximum total of   1,140,304   LTIP Units to three executives under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The number of LTIPs Units actually earned by the grantees will be based on the achievement of established performance hurdles with respect to our actual and relative total shareholder returns during the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019. Of the earned units, 50.0% will vest on June 30, 2019, and the remaining 50.0% will vest on June 30, 2020, based on continued employment through that date. Vested LTIP Units are convertible on a 1-for-1 basis to our common shares. 
    
  In July 2016, our board of trustees approved the establishment of an  at the market  equity issuance program, or ATM. We expect to file a prospectus supplement to our currently effective registration statement with the SEC during November 2016, pursuant to which we may offer and sell common shares with an aggregate gross sales price of up to   $375,000  . 
  In February 2015, the board of directors of legacy Gramercy approved a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of our common stock and outstanding OP Units. The reverse stock split was effective after the close of trading on March 20, 2015, and our common stock began trading on a reverse split-adjusted basis on the New York Stock Exchange on March 23, 2015.  
   
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In February 2016, our board of trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100,000 of our outstanding common shares. Purchases under the program will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not repurchase any shares. 
   
  Market Capitalization 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated market capitalization was $6,169,291 based on a common share price of $9.64 per share and the closing price of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on   September 30, 2016  . Market capitalization includes consolidated debt and common and preferred shares.

  Mortgage Loans      
  Certain of our real estate assets are subject to mortgage loans. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we assumed   $45,958   of non-recourse mortgages in connection with   11   real estate acquisitions,   $12,931   associated with   2   properties distributed from the Duke JV, and entered into one non-recourse mortgage for   $9,550  . During the year ended December 31, 2015, we assumed   $618,169   of non-recourse mortgages in connection with   42   real estate acquisitions, of which   $464,292   related to mortgages on   29   properties acquired in connection with the Merger. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid off the debt on   14   properties encumbered by mortgage loans and during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid off the debt on   22   properties encumbered by mortgage loans and transferred one mortgage to the buyer of the encumbered property. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 we defeased a mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of   $124,605   that encumbered   11   properties, through the purchase of treasury securities, which were immediately sold along with the associated debt. As a result, during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $(13,777)   and   $(20,890)  , including net gains on extinguishment of debt of $0 and   $1,930   within discontinued operations, respectively, related to unamortized deferred financing costs and mortgage premiums and discounts that were immediately expensed upon termination as well as early termination fees and defeasance fees incurred for the extinguishments. We did not pay off any mortgage loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our mortgage loans include a series of financial and other covenants that we have to comply with in order to borrow under them. We were in compliance with the covenants under the mortgage loan facilities as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
   
  2015 Credit Facility and Term Loans 
  At the close of the Merger on December 17, 2015, both Legacy Gramercy and Chambers terminated the Legacy Gramercy unsecured credit facilities and entered into an agreement, or the Credit Agreement, for a new   $850,000   senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a   $1,225,000   term loan facility, or the 2015 Term Loan with JPMorgan Chase Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated. The   $850,000   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, consists of a   $750,000   U.S. dollar revolving credit facility and a   $100,000   multicurrency revolving credit facility. The 2015 Term Loan consists of a   $300,000   term loan facility that matures in   January 2019   with   one     12  -month extension, or the   3  -Year Term Loan, and a   $750,000   term loan facility that matures in   January 2021  , or the   5  -Year Term Loan. The 2015 Revolving Credit Facility matures in   January 2020  , but may be extended for   two   additional   six   month periods upon the payment of applicable fees and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. Net proceeds from the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were used to fund acquisitions of properties and repayments of mortgage debt. Borrowings under the multicurrency loan denominated in euros and British pounds sterling are designated as non-derivative net investment hedges to mitigate the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Refer to Note 10 of the accompanying financial statements for further information on our hedges. At the close of the Merger on December 17, 2015, we also entered into a new   $175,000     seven  -year unsecured term loan with Capital One, N.A., or the 7-Year Term Loan, which matures in   January 2023  .  
  During the first half of 2016, we amended our 5-Year Term Loan and our 7-Year Term Loan in order to remove the 0.00% rate floor on the applicable LIBOR that existed in the original loan agreements. Our unsecured borrowing facilities include a series of financial and other covenants that we have to comply with in order to borrow under the facilities. We were in compliance with the covenants under the facilities as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there were borrowings of   $163,365   outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, including   $93,365   ( 45,000 and  33,000) on the multicurrency tranche, and borrowings of   $1,225,000   outstanding under our term loans.  
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On December 17, 2015, we issued and sold   $100,000   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, or the Senior Unsecured Notes, and on January 12, 2016 we issued and sold an additional   $50,000   aggregate principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes in private placements. The Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by us and bear interest at a rate of   4.97%   per annum, with interest payable in arrears on June 17 and December 17 of each year, commencing June 17, 2016, until the maturity date of   December 17, 2024  .  

Exchangeable Senior Notes 
  On March 18, 2014, we issued   $115,000   of   3.75%   Exchangeable Senior Notes. The Exchangeable Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of our Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by us on a senior unsecured basis. The Exchangeable Senior Notes mature on   March 15, 2019  , unless redeemed, repurchased or exchanged in accordance with their terms prior to such date and will be exchangeable, under certain circumstances, for cash, for common shares or for a combination of cash and common shares, at the Operating Partnership s election. The Exchangeable Senior Notes will also be exchangeable prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date, at any time beginning on December 15, 2018, and also upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after March 20, 2017, in certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or part of the Exchangeable Senior Notes for cash at a price equal to   100.0%   of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Exchangeable Senior Notes have a current exchange rate of   41.5897   units of Merger consideration, where one unit of Merger consideration represents   3.1898   of our common shares, or approximately   132.6628   of our common shares for each   $1.0   principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. The fair value of the Exchangeable Senior Notes was determined at issuance to be   $106,689  . The discount is being amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Exchangeable Senior Notes were recorded as a liability at carrying value of   $108,186   and   $106,581  , respectively, net of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of   $6,814   and   $8,419  , respectively. The fair value of the embedded exchange option of the Exchangeable Senior Notes was recorded in additional paid-in-capital within shareholders  equity of   $11,726   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
  
   75 

Derivatives and Non-Derivative Hedging Instruments  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps, which are cash flow hedges. Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item expires or is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative s change in fair value and the change in value of a non-hedging derivative instrument are immediately recognized in earnings. Derivative accounting may increase or decrease reported net income and shareholders  equity, depending on future levels of LIBOR interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows, provided the contract is carried through to full term.  
  Borrowings on the multicurrency tranche of our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, which are designated as non-derivative net investment hedges, are recognized at par value based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of the draw. Subsequent changes in the exchange rate of our non-derivative net investment hedge are recognized as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (loss). Refer to Note   2   and Note   9   of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our derivatives and non-derivative hedging instruments, including the fair value measurement of these instruments, as applicable. 
  The following table summarizes our derivatives and hedging instruments at   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate fair value of our derivatives is presented in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in d  erivative instruments and the aggregate carrying value of the non-derivative net investment hedges is included in the balance of our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility.   The notional value is an indication of the extent of our involvement in this instrument at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks. 
  Our derivatives and hedging instruments as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

76 

Through our interest rate swaps, we are hedging exposure to variability in future interest payments on our debt facilities. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate swap derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as a net liability of   $28,613  . Swap (gain) loss of   $(83)   and   $(817)   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, was recognized as interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations with respect to interest rate swap hedge ineffectiveness, or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness, which relates to the off-market financing element associated with certain derivatives. As discussed in the Unsecured Debt section above, during the first half of 2016 we amended our 5-Year Term Loan and our 7-Year Term Loan in order to remove the 0.00% rate floor on the applicable LIBOR that existed in the original loan agreements, and as a result, during the second quarter of 2016 we reversed previously recorded hedge ineffectiveness of   $2,564  . No gain or loss was recognized with respect to hedge ineffectiveness or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we reclassified   $274   and   $905  , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense related to a derivative terminated in 2015. Over time, the realized and unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. During the next 12 months, we expect that   $9,113   will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase in interest expense for our interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, we will recognize   $2,923   in interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining original term of terminated swaps through June 2019, representing amortization of the remaining accumulated other comprehensive income balance related to the swap, and of this amount,   $1,087   will be recognized in interest expense during the next 12 months. 
  We hedge our investments based in foreign currencies using non-derivative net investment hedges in conjunction with borrowings under the multicurrency tranche of our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. Our non-derivative net investment hedge on our euro-denominated investments, which was entered into in September 2015, is used to hedge exposure to changes in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate underlying our unconsolidated net equity investments in the Gramercy European Property Fund and the Goodman Europe JV, both of which have euros as their functional currency. Our non-derivative net investment hedge on our British pound sterling-denominated investments, which was entered into in July 2016, is used to hedge exposure to changes in the British pound sterling-U.S. dollar exchange rate underlying our unconsolidated net equity investment in the Goodman UK JV and our wholly-owned property in Coventry, UK, both of which have British pounds sterling as their functional currency. At   September 30, 2016  , the non-derivative net investment hedge value is reported at carrying value as a net liability of   $93,365  , which is included in the balance of the senior unsecured revolving credit facility on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a net loss of   $109   and   $175  , respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) from the impact of exchange rates related to the non-derivative net investment hedges.   No   gain or loss was recognized with respect to non-derivative net investment hedge ineffectiveness, or to amounts excluded from ineffectiveness, in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . When the non-derivative net investment is sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the translation adjustment accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings. 
  In June 2016, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements in the euro, specifically in relation to funds received in euros on the sale of 74.9% of our 80.0% interest in the Goodman Europe JV. The foreign currency forward was a derivative contract, which was not designated as a hedging instrument, through which we committed to deliver a certain amount of currency at a set price on a specific date in the future. The forward contract locked in our future currency exchange rate for the term of the contract, thus minimizing our exposure to rate fluctuations during this period. We settled the contract on July 7, 2016. During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized net income (loss) of   $128   and   $(22)  , respectively, in other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, related to the change in the value of the euro-denominated asset underlying the contract. Changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contract have been recognized in other income on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Contractual Obligations 
  We are obligated to fund capital expenditures related to our real estate investments, which primarily consist of expenditures to maintain assets, tenant improvement allowances and other construction or expansion obligations under tenant leases, and leasing commissions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments relating to tenant improvement allowances and funding obligations under leases totaling approximately   $28,897     that are expected to be funded over the next five years  . In September 2016, we acquired a parcel of land in Summerville, South Carolina, on which we are funding construction of a 240,800 square foot manufacturing facility with estimated total project costs of $31,201 that will be 100.0 % leased upon completion. Additionally, we are obligated to fund the development of a build-to-suit property in Round Rock, Texas, which is a consolidated VIE, and upon substantial completion of the development to acquire the property 100.0% leased through a forward purchase contract. Our remaining future commitment for these build-to-suit properties at   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $47,460  . 
  As of September 30, 2016, we have funded   $55,892   (   50,000  ) to the Gramercy European Property Fund, representing our total funding commitment to the Gramercy European Property Fund. As of December 31, 2015, we had funded $25,663 ( 23,160) to the Gramercy European Property Fund. Since inception, all equity investors, including Gramercy, have collectively committed and funded $395,213 ( 352,500) in equity capital to the Gramercy European Property Fund. As of September 30, 2016, the commitments of all equity investors to the Gramercy European Property Fund have been fully funded.  Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the closing date for completed transactions and (ii) the exchange rate that prevailed on   September 30, 2016  , in the case of unfunded commitments.  
  We have   committed to fund $100,000 to   Strategic Office Partners, of which $16,618 has been funded as of   September 30, 2016  . See Note   5  ,  Unconsolidated Equity Investments,  in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Gramercy European Property Fund and Strategic Office Partners. 
  Combined aggregate principal maturities and future minimum payments of our unsecured debt obligations, non-recourse mortgages, Senior Unsecured Notes, Exchangeable Senior Notes, and ground leases, in addition to associated interest payments, as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows:  

We have several office locations, which are each subject to operating lease agreements. These office locations include our corporate office at 521 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, and our seven regional offices located across the United States and Europe. Additionally, in April 2016, we entered into a lease for a new corporate office location at 90 Park Avenue, New York, New York. We will relocate to the new office upon completion of improvements to the space, which is projected to be in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  
   78 

Leasing Agreements 
  Future minimum rental revenue under non-cancelable leases, excluding reimbursements for operating expenses, as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Future straight-line rent adjustments under non-cancelable leases as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
  We have off-balance-sheet investments, including joint ventures and equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. Substantially all of our joint venture and equity investment arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture and equity investment arrangements. Our off-balance-sheet arrangements and financial results are discussed in detail in Note   5   in the accompanying financial statements. 

79 

Dividends  
  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our shareholders of at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable. Dividends declared during 2015 and 2016 are as follows: 

(1)  
    Common dividends declared for a quarter are accrued for during the quarter and then paid to common shareholders of record as of the end of the quarter during the month following the quarter-end. 
      
  Transactions with Trustee Related Entities and Related Parties 
  On June 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell 74.9% of our outstanding 80.0% interest in the Goodman Europe JV to the Gramercy European Property Fund, in which we have a 14.2% interest as of September 30, 2016. The Company has committed and funded total capital of   $55,892   (   50,000  ) and the Company s CEO, who is on the board of directors, also has capital commitments to the investment, as noted below. We sold 74.9% of our interest in the Goodman Europe JV to the Gramercy European Property Fund for gross proceeds of   $148,884   (   134,336  ). The sale of 74.9% of our interest in the Goodman Europe JV resulted in us recording a gain of   $5,341   primarily related to depreciation and amortization recorded since Merger closing date. This gain amount is recorded as a gain on sale of unconsolidated equity investment interests held with a related party on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Following the sale transaction, we have a continuing   5.1%   interest in the Goodman Europe JV. The transaction was entered into in order to achieve efficiencies from the combination of the two European platforms.  
  Our CEO, Gordon F. DuGan, is on the board of directors of the Gramercy European Property Fund and has invested approximately   $1,388   (   1,250  ) in capital to the Gramercy European Property Fund. The two Managing Directors of Gramercy Europe Asset Management have collectively invested approximately   $1,388   (   1,250  ) in capital to the Gramercy European Property Fund. Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the closing date for completed transactions and (ii) the exchange rate that prevailed on   September 30, 2016  , in the case of unfunded commitments. 
  One of the properties acquired in December 2015 as part of the Merger was partially leased to Duke Realty, our partner in the Duke JV. Duke Realty acted as the managing member of the Duke JV which was dissolved in July 2016 as described in Note 5, and as such provided asset management, construction, development, leasing and property management services, for which it was entitled to receive fees as well as a promoted interest. From the date of the Merger through lease expiration in May 2016, Duke Realty leased   30,777   square feet of one of our office properties located in Minnesota which had an aggregate   322,551   rent  able square feet. Duke Realty paid us   $333   under the lease for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . See Note 5 for more information on our transactions with the Duke JV. 
  We acquired three properties in January 2015 in an arms-length transaction from affiliates of KTR Capital Partners, a private industrial real estate investment company, for which one of our trustees, Jeffrey Kelter, served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The properties are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, comprise an aggregate   450,000   square feet and were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $19,750  .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  We use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as a key supplemental measure of our operating performance: funds from operations attributable to common shareholders and unitholders, or FFO, core funds from operations attributable to common shareholders and unitholders, or Core FFO, and adjusted funds from operations attributable to common shareholders and unitholders, or AFFO. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to noncontrolling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. 
  Core FFO and AFFO are presented excluding property acquisition costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, other-than-temporary impairments on retained bonds, and other one-time charges. Our AFFO also excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of lease inducement costs, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of free rent received at property acquisition, straight-line rent, and these AFFO adjustments as they pertain to unconsolidated equity investments. We believe that Core FFO and AFFO are useful supplemental measures regarding our operating performances as they provide a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance. 
  FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculation of FFO may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
  
   81 

FFO, Core FFO and AFFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

82 

(1) 
    For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and nine months ended September 30,   2015  , the diluted weighted average share calculations, which represent the denominator in diluted earnings per share, exclude potentially dilutive securities because including them would have been anti-dilutive during the periods.

We assume no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider these risks and uncertainties, together with the other risks described from time-to-time in our reports and documents which are filed with the SEC, and you should not place undue reliance on those statements.  
  The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK  
  (dollar amounts in thousands  ) 
  Market Risk  
  Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, credit, commodity prices, equity prices,   foreign currency exchange rates,   and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risks to which we will be exposed are real estate, interest rate, credit, and foreign currency exchange risks. These risks are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. 
  Generally, we do not use derivative instruments to hedge credit/market risks or for speculative purposes. However, from time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. 
  Real Estate Risk  
  Commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions, local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of retail, industrial, office or other commercial or multi-family space), changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments, construction quality, age and design, demographic factors, retroactive changes to building or similar codes, and increases in operating expenses (such as energy costs). We may seek to mitigate these risks by employing careful business selection, rigorous underwriting and credit approval processes and attentive asset management. 
  Interest Rate Risk  
  Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets and our borrowing costs. Our real estate assets generate income principally from fixed long-term leases and we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from floating rate borrowing arrangements. We expect that we will primarily finance our investment in commercial real estate with fixed rate, non-recourse mortgage financing, however, to the extent that we use floating rate borrowing arrangements, our net income from our real estate investments will generally decrease if LIBOR increases. We have used, and may continue to use, interest rate caps or swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We currently have a 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, several term loans and several mortgage notes payable which are based upon a floating rate which have an aggregate outstanding balance of   $1,429,524   at   September 30, 2016  , of which $966,159 is hedged effectively by interest rate swaps which we believe will mitigate the interest rate risk related to these borrowings. 
  
   86 

The following chart shows our floating rate debt instruments, including debt that is hedged by interest rate swaps, and the related interest rates, maturity dates and balances as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Represents the rate at which interest expense is recorded for financial reporting purposes, which reflects the amortization of any discounts/premiums, excluding debt issuance costs. 
              (2) 
    These floating rate debt instruments are not hedged by interest rate swaps. 
     The following chart shows a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for the interest rate risk related to the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and $300,000 of the balance on the term loans: 

Credit Risk  
  Credit risk refers to the ability of each tenant in our portfolio of real estate investments to make contractual lease payments on the scheduled due dates. We seek to reduce credit risk of our real estate investments by entering into long-term leases with tenants after a careful evaluation of credit worthiness as part of our property acquisition process. If defaults occur, we employ our asset management resources to mitigate the severity of any losses and seek to relet the property. In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, tenant delinquencies and defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  
  
   87 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
  We have investments, either directly or through unconsolidated equity interest, in Europe, Asia and Canada and we operate an asset management business and have capital commitments to an equity investment in Europe. As a result, we are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in the euro, the British pound sterling, and the Canadian dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows. We hedge our foreign currency exposure related to our foreign investments primarily by financing our investments in the local currency denominations and through the use of net investment hedge instruments. Additionally, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements. We have historically been a net payer of various foreign currencies (we pay out more cash than we receive), and therefore our foreign operations benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar, and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, relative to the foreign currency. In the future, we expect to be a net receiver of various foreign currencies as our commitments to the Gramercy European Property Fund have been fully funded. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $93,365 ( 45,000 and  33,000) and   $21,724   ( 20,000), respectively, under the multicurrency tranche of our 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, which we designated as a non-derivative net investment hedging instrument pursuant to ASC 815 to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and both the euro and British pound sterling. Our unhedged net investment in foreign currencies was $15,007 and $1,661 as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, based on the period ending U.S. dollar values of the hedge of   $93,365   and   $21,724  , respectively. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses of   $1,120   and   $3,687  , respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign currency exposure. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized realized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of   $185   and   $104  , respectively, and no unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized net realized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of   $15   and   $25  , respectively, and no unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

ITEM 4.  
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frame specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.  
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    OTHER INFORMATION 
      
           ITEM 1.  
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
     (Dollar amounts in thousands) 
  Legacy Gramercy, its board of directors, Chambers and/or Merger Sub are named as defendants in two pending putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Legacy Gramercy stockholders challenging the Merger. Two suits that were separately filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County, captioned (i) Berliner v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Index No. 652424/2015 (filed July 9, 2015) and (ii) Gensler v. Baum, et al., Index No. 157432/2015 (filed July 22, 2015), have been consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Gramercy Property Trust Stockholder Litigation, Index No. 652424/2015 (the  New York Action ). In addition, four suits that were separately filed in Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, captioned (i) Jobin v. DuGan, et al., Case No. 24C15003942 (filed July 27, 2015)  (ii) Vojik v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Case No. 24C15004412 (filed August 25, 2015)  (iii) Hoffbauer et al. v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., 24C15004904 (filed September 24, 2015) (originally filed as two separate suits in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland, captioned Plemons v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., Case No. 03C15007943 (filed July 24, 2015) and Hoffbauer et al. v. Chambers Street Properties, et al., Case No. 03C15008639 (filed August 12, 2015), and refiled as a single action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on September 24, 2015)  and (iv) Morris v. Gramercy Property Trust, et al., Case No. 24C15004972 (filed September 28, 2015) have been consolidated into a single action under the caption Glenn W. Morris v. Gramercy Property Trust Inc. et al., Case No. 24C15004972 (the  Maryland Action,  and together with the New York Action, the  Actions ). The complaints allege, among other things, that the directors of Legacy Gramercy breached their fiduciary duties to Legacy Gramercy stockholders by agreeing to sell the Company for inadequate consideration and agreeing to improper deal protection terms in the merger agreement, and that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on Form S4 on September 11, 2015 was materially incomplete and misleading. The complaints also allege that Chambers, Merger Sub and/or Legacy Gramercy aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duty. The amended complaint in the Morris consolidated action also asserts derivative claims on behalf of Legacy Gramercy for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors of Legacy Gramercy. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, an injunction barring the Merger, rescission of the Merger to the extent it is already implemented, declaratory relief, an award of damages and/or costs/attorney fees. 
  On December 7, 2015, the parties to the Actions entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the  MOU ), which provides for the settlement of the Actions. While the defendants in the Actions continue to vigorously deny all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage to any of the plaintiffs or the class of stockholders of Legacy Gramercy, and believe that no supplemental disclosure is required under the applicable law, in order to (i) avoid the burden, inconvenience, expense and distraction of further litigation in connection with the Actions, (ii) finally put to rest and terminate all of the claims that were or could have been asserted against the defendants in the Actions and (iii) permit the Merger to proceed without risk of the courts in New York or Maryland ordering an injunction or damages in connection with the Actions, Chambers and Legacy Gramercy agreed, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, pursuant to the terms of the MOU, to make certain supplemental disclosures related to the Merger, which were set forth in Legacy Gramercy s Current Report on Form 8K filed with on December 7, 2015. 
  Pursuant to the MOU, the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement. The stipulation of settlement is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, court approval following notice to Legacy Gramercy stockholders. On November 2, 2016, the court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement and scheduling a hearing to consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement. If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it will resolve and release all claims by stockholders of Legacy Gramercy challenging the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any disclosure made in connection therewith, pursuant to terms that will be set forth in the notice sent to Legacy Gramercy stockholders prior to final approval of the settlement. In addition, in connection with the settlement, the parties contemplate that plaintiffs  counsel will file a petition for an award of attorneys  fees and expenses to be paid by Gramercy or its successor. There can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement. In the event that the settlement is not approved or that the conditions are not satisfied, the settlement may be terminated.

On October 1, 2015, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County by a purported shareholder of Chambers. The action, captioned Elstein v. Chambers Street Properties et al., Docket No. L00225415 (the  New Jersey Action ), names as defendants Chambers, its board of trustees and Legacy Gramercy. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the trustees of Chambers breached their fiduciary duties to Chambers  shareholders by agreeing to the Merger after a flawed sales process and by approving improper deal protection terms in the merger agreement, and that Legacy Gramercy aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaint also alleges that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus was materially misleading and incomplete. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, an injunction barring the Merger, rescission of the Merger to the extent it is already implemented, declaratory relief and an award of damages.  
  On December 3, 2015, the parties to the New Jersey Action entered into a Stipulation of Settlement providing for the settlement of the New Jersey Action. While the defendants in the New Jersey Action continue to vigorously deny all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage to any of the plaintiffs or the class of shareholders of Chambers, and believe that no supplemental disclosure is required under the applicable law, in order to (i) avoid the burden, inconvenience, expense and distraction of further litigation in connection with the New Jersey Action, (ii) finally put to rest and terminate all of the claims that were or could have been asserted against the defendants in the New Jersey Action and (iii) permit the Merger to proceed without risk of the Superior Court of New Jersey ordering an injunction or damages in connection with the New Jersey Action, Chambers and Legacy Gramercy agreed, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, to make certain supplemental disclosures related to the Merger, all of which were set forth in Legacy Gramercy s Current Report on Form 8K filed with on December 7, 2015. The Stipulation of Settlement is subject to customary conditions, including court approval following notice to the Chambers shareholders. On April 4, 2016, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On July 1, 2016 the court issued a final order approving the settlement. 
  The defendants believe the lawsuits are without merit. 
  In December 2010, we sold our 45.0% joint venture interest in the leased fee of the 2 Herald Square property in New York, New York, for approximately $25,600 plus assumed mortgage debt of approximately $86,100, or the 2 Herald Sale Transaction. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, the New York City Department of Finance, or the NYC DOF, and New York State Department of Taxation, or the NYS DOT, issued notices of determination assessing, in the case of the NYC DOF notice, approximately $2,924 of real property transfer tax, plus interest, and, in the case of the NYS DOT notice, approximately $446 of real property transfer tax, plus interest, collectively, the Transfer Tax Assessments, against us in connection with the 2 Herald Sale Transaction.  
  In September 2013, we filed a petition challenging the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment with the New York City Tax Appeal Tribunal. In July 2014, we filed a similar petition challenging the NYS DOT Transfer Tax Assessment. Trial of our NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment appeal was completed in December 2014. 
  In April 2015, a New York City Administrative Law Judge denied our petition challenging the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment and ruled that we were liable for the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment. In July 2015, we appealed the adverse Administrative Law Judge decision to the New York City Tax Appeals Tribunal, or the NYC Tribunal. In July 2016, the NYC Tribunal denied our appeal. In November 2016, we appealed the adverse decision of the NYC Tribunal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. A decision by the Appellate Division is expected in the second quarter of 2017. 
  In June 2016, a New York State Administrative Law Judge ruled in our favor in connection with the NYS DOT Transfer Tax Assessment. In July 2016, NYS DOT appealed the adverse Administrative Law Judge decision to the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal, or the NYS Tribunal. A hearing before the NYS Tribunal is expected in the first quarter of 2017. 
  In April 2015, to stop the accrual of additional interest while our appeal is pending, we paid the NYC DOF   $4,025   in full satisfaction of the NYC DOF Transfer Tax Assessment and the NYS DOT   $617   in full satisfaction of the NYS DOF Transfer Tax Assessment. There was   no   additional interest recorded in discontinued operations for the matter for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There was   $0   and   $68   of additional interest recorded in discontinued operations for the matter for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  In connection with our property acquisitions and the Merger, we determined that there is a risk we will have to pay future amounts to tenants related to continuing operating expense reimbursement audits. We have estimated a range of loss and determined that our best estimate of total loss is   $8,000  , including   $1,000   related to the Merger, which has been accrued and recorded in other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  . We have determined that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred in excess of   $8,000   and estimate this range to be   $8,000   to   $13,000  . 
  In addition, we and/or one or more of our subsidiaries are party to various litigation matters that are considered routine litigation incidental to our business, none of which are considered material.
